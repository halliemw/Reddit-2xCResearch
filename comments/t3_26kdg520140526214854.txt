Talking to moms at this point in your life about these kinds of things can be awkward.  I remember that when I got my first period (at age 12) my mom was kind of snippy with me, which just made it worse. And the entire time I was living at home she refused to entertain the idea of tampons. 

I'm going to be real with you. I think my mom and the tampon thing and your mom and the DD thing have a common thread-- there is something that society has deemed "sexual" about completely normal female experiences, and I think that's what has made our respective mothers uncomfortable. My mom didn't want me sticking things in my vagina because young ladies have no place doing that-- kind of along the lines of the myth that using tampons makes you "not a virgin," which by the way is a load of crap.  I kind of sense that your mom might think it's (for lack of a better term) "inappropriate" for a young woman your age to have DD sized breasts. But guess what? You can't make them any smaller! 

You have a right to be comfortable in your clothes and comfortable in your body. Go for the DD bra that feels good on you. If you are a bigger size, don't worry about it. If men leer at you and look at you differently, seriously tell them to jog off-- your body is yours and does not exist for their pleasure. You don't deserve to be treated that way. As for your brother, as long as he isn't being rude to you about the process of puberty, I would say he'll get used to it eventually. I'm the oldest of 3 girls, and even though I went through it myself it was still a little strange watching my sisters go through it. 

You are normal. You are just fine. It's puberty. It's rough for a few years and then it's over and you get to join the terrifying world of grownups :) The most important thing is that YOU love your body and feel comfortable in your own skin.
