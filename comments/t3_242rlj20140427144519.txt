I'm in physical sciences, and yes there are still many departments that are 100% male. It's crazy considering the latest statistics show that only ~60% of those getting PhDs in my field are white men. In some cases there will be an adjunct faculty member or lecturer who is female, but then every tenure-track/tenured faculty member is male.

In the case of the department that has seen 4 women fail to get tenure in the past few years, it seemed that this department has unrealistic tenure expectations given the level of research time and support they give their faculty. The course loads are very high, the startup support is low, and the TA support for graduate students is low so they are not attracting great students. They have no faculty mentoring programs in place. When I asked about mentoring, they said that they feel that is best left up to faculty as they don't want to force anything on anyone. If the entire department is male, and there is no formal program for mentoring junior faculty, who is more likely to get mentored, an incoming male or an incoming female faculty member? It was not lost on me that 2 men have gained tenure during the time that 4 women were denied tenure.

Of course there are likely a number of other issues at play and these are just some of my observations from two days visiting their department.

I think those of us who have been at R1s in each step of our matriculation are at a disadvantage because we don't know what the other academic paths look like. When applying to jobs this year, I looked at SLAC and smaller state school options, but ended up only applying to R1s for the exactly that reason. I know what it takes at an R1 and it's what I've been trained and prepared for...
