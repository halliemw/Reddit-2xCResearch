So far no one has used the phrase "honey bitch" which I read on another similar thread a few months ago. The idea is that you respond in a way that seems outwardly nice but is actually telling them to fuck off. Like when older guys say you're beautiful say something like, "Aww, my grandpa tells me the same thing!" or "That's sweet! You remind me of my little brother." You're not being rude, but it doesn't exactly stroke their egos either.
