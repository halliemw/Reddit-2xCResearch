You look great in that dress in all three pictures.  Wow on your style!  And way to go on being healthy.  I started in my late 20s too and changing food habits was my big thing too.  

My little sister, when I turned 30, told me not too worry about being 30, in 10 years I'd be 40.  In January, my older sister turned 40 and I'm not 2 years behind her.  I started thinking about what I want to do before I'm 40.  As I've lapsed on health for the last few years due to loss and depression, health is on the top of the list and I've made good progress over the last few months.  But I'm also thinking about the Peru and Belize trips I've wanted forever.  And the return to Africa after a 20 day working trip a few years ago is a new dream.  

You are obviously in a very powerful position with yourself and your future right now.  What else might you want?
