Nope. Hormones effects fat distribution (what you are thinking of) and muscle growth and retention. Muscles need testosterone to maintain and grow. Mtf transitions typically include taking an anti androgyn that blocks the production of testosterone thereby decreasing muscle gains and making it harder than to grow and gain than a cis woman.
