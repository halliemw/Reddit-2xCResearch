Urgh, it's horrible, isn't it? I think the worst was when I was at a party without my boyfriend, and after fending off all the questions about where he was (because god forbid I have go and have fun without him!), when he asked "do you want me to be a replacement boyfriend for you?" with the most disgusting wink. 

And then just yesterday, someone else "fraped" him, posting a couple of sexual advances as him. In the resulting conversation, someone was quick to point out that he "would never say anything like this". It took a lot of self restraint to not start bringing up everything he's said to me like that in such a public space!

Anyways, I sincerely hope you find some way to shut him up! It's really not fair on you at all.
