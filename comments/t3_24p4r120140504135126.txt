If you have an i-thing, I highly recommend the myfitnesspal app. I religiously keep track of what I eat now, because I've always had trouble with portion control and it's really helped me get control of my diet. I'd tried counting calories before, but it was hard to do with pen and paper and this app makes it much easier. I've been at it for about two months and now making smart choices is much easier.
