I'd much rather we reclaim the word "slut", a la "The Ethical Slut" and Jessica Valenti's "The Purity Myth" rather than let ourselves be hurt by it. To me a slut is a sex-positive woman who has had multiple partners and doesn't make decisions about sex based on what is traditional or socially acceptable. So yes, I would call myself a slut, and I don't see anything wrong with that.
