I'm loving all of this great advice! Yeah, I need to be clear about my comfort level, and he wasn't all that bad. I'm pretty sure that he was just bad at approaching women like you mentioned.

I've handled myself well in a bad situation before, so when it comes down to it I can get myself out if something goes sour. I just get consumed with "what-ifs" and waste time on that rather than letting go and moving on.
