I think her point was that it's a very significant portion of your time in STEM fields, especially as we move more and more toward computer models and mathematical models. Research, for example, is at least 85% sitting in front of a computer, organizing and analyzing your data. The same is true of being an engineer from what I've gathered from my dad (ChE), uncles (EE and IE), and cousin (CE). If on the other hand you go into law, you spend a significant time in front of a computer but it's not doing any calculations or math. The same goes for graphic design, journalism, social work, teaching, architecture, and a variety of other careers. If you really despise math and are terrible at it, which some people are, then a STEM career is not going to be for you, and that's ok. 

I think the biggest cause of the gender gap right now, at least in some fields, is the perception that girls aren't good at math. By the time they're in middle school, many girls have learned to hate math when they otherwise might not have minded it. If you can't do math, you can't do chemistry, physics, or biology, and if you can't do any of those, you aren't going to be an engineer.
