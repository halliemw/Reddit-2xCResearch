How far out is the wedding? The last wedding I went to, I had only received the invitation four weeks ahead of time. I was starting to wonder, but some people are pretty last minute. Or maybe your invitation got lost in the mail, and the bride is sitting there annoyed at your for not RSVPing yet.

I guess I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt here. But yes, if you received a save the date and attended the bridal shower that would very rude on her end. I would call her and see what's up.
