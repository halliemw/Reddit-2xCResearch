Definitely spend a couple of years living apart from her. It takes a while for you to figure out which bits of you are entirely your own. For example, it took two years of living away for me to really realize that my clothes and hair were mine, and I could alter them without taking her tastes into account. I'm slow :) Living away has given me more confidence in what I want, so even if she ridicules it I know I don't agree, and I feel less like I have to say I agree with her just to keep the peace.

I felt really compelled to try and follow her ideal version of me when I was very young, partly because even small attempts at having my own tastes caused huge fights. From her perspective it probably seems like college really changed me when it just gave me an opportunity to dress or talk without having someone tell me I was disgusting or force me to change before I could leave the house. 

Somehow she forgets how obviously I was heading this direction and how hard she had to clamp down to keep me in line with her idea of what I should be.

There have been a few years where we just didn't talk about anything real, because anything real that didn't match her expectations was ridiculed, and most of my life just didn't match. I am trying to very very slowly mention real stuff here and there, but I can remember her openly ridiculing my life goals as recently as two years ago (they had to get mentioned, I was moving for grad school, otherwise she wouldn't have known anything about it)

The change she's lately evinced has been unsettling, but I'm cautiously optimistic it's actually at least partly real. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you too!
