So I suffered from suicidal ideation for a while. It got to the point where it was happening all the time and even things like seeing a pencil would make me think these horrible thoughts. That's when I knew I needed help. I got on anti depressants and started seeing a therapist. It's been over four years since that happened and I'm feeling so much better now. 

Anyway, I read the Bell Jar last year and it was one of the worst things I could've done. It was a good read but man did it bring back those bad thoughts and it sent me into a funk for a good month or two. Seriously, warning to anyone, do not read The Bell Jar if you have a history of suicidal ideation or depression. 

I'd say that the occasional thought about your death is normal, but I haven't thought about it in a very long time. Maybe if it happens more than once a month think about seeing a therapist and/or doctor.
