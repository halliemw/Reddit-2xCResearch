I'm somewhat similar. Sometimes, all I need is to talk it out. It may seem like what I'm talking about has no meaning in the present, but there's a reason that it's being brought up. I do my best to make it about me, and not about her. And once I get it out, I'm usually okay. Sometimes I'll have to process it a bit more, but it eventually dies down.

I think it's an amazing thing when you can find someone who will actually just listen to you and not make you feel any which-way about the things you are expressing. Not everyone needs a therapist, some people just need an ear.
