I went to a free clinic when my husband and I first started dating and they asked us if it was okay to hear the results together. We said yes and after the testing they put us in the same room and told us we were both clean.

Then they called a while later to tell us we were HIV negative since I guess those tests take longer?

But anyway, if you can find a clinic and hear your results together, I think that is the best option with new partners
