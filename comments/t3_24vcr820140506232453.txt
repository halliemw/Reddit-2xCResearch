5'1" checking in, I totally agree with you about the weight thing. I used to be underweight and I looked so scrawny (best way I could describe it, certainly not tall and slender!) and now that I'm slightly overweight, I look dumpy as hell. 

I would kill for a tapered waist but my torso's too short for that to ever happen, even when I was underweight or normal weight.

I also look young for my age and I used to look like a school kid in my mid-20s. My bf used to ask me not to wear a headband in public because it made him look like he's a pedo with a kid in public. :( I found that wearing slightly more "mature" clothes, aka smart/casual or officey clothes help with the age thing.

Oh and I've given up on buying pants, so annoying having to take the hem up on pants legs. It's skirts and dresses all the way.
