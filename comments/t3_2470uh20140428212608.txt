I went through about 6 months of hell when I first got my IUD, I am totally happy I did it though.  See first my doctor had me wait until I had my period to do the damn thing so I had those cramps to do with, then they gave me a med that helps loosen up the cervix a bit which caused me more cramps and pain...

The day it was done I was fine went home passed out from the whole thing.  I had a week without work which was awesome, I laid in bed and ate ice cream for the most part, also ate pie a lot.  It was near one of those holidays were pie is vital to life. 

After the first week the pain just went away but then I got bi weekly periods for a bit, those cramps were worse than normal the first 3 months.  After that I ended up getting a job where my body synced up to the cycle of other women I worked with, which was odd but we worked close and 40+ hours a week.   Then one day out of the blue it all just stopped.  No cramps, no blood, no nothing.  Just those damn strings at time caught me off gaurd when I went to check it, they didn't soften up as much as my doc made me think they would.  This was all back in 2012, I am very happy now. 

I have however started getting "periods" again.  When I say this I mean I spot for a day and it is so light that I may not even need a panty liner.  Over all that first week of pain was worth it, those next 6 months made me question it a bit, but eh.  Would do again.
