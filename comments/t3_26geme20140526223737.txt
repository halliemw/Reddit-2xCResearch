Thank you darling. I really appreciate that comment. I guess most people are doing the best with what they have with where they're at. I think it's definitely best to try and be sensitive and understanding with friends.

I am familiar with CBT, I think it would be super helpful. Though I'm not even sure how to find a professional that does that kind of therapy.
