He has a false sense of purpose now. People who tell him to ease up are "lukewarm" Christians. It's honestly the perfect sell. He has a sense of superiority and anyone who tells him otherwise has demons or isn't as strong of a Christian as he is. 

Honestly just say that God has no use for his money and if God wants his family to join him that it's God's will. There's little to nothing you can say to these people.
