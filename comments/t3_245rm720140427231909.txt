Of course they have.  Two million people in the United States have won the lottery.  After 32-33, fertility starts dropping rapidly.  By 35, if you've never had a child, statistically, you never will.   Yes, it can be done.  But it's much more likely you won't.

And then you you get into high rates of birth defects and infant mortality.  

If you want kids, 27 is at the tail end of the optimal time to have them.  From here on out, it starts looking scarier and scarier.

I repeat: stick the plan, save, get your life in order, but quickly.  Kids are expensive, but not prohibitively.  It's better to cancel cable, scale back the internet, bike to work, cook at home, and live very frugally, then to wait a few more years until you are more secure financially.  There's no guarantee that it will work, and it is likely that you are going to have a hard time down the road.  The longer you wait for that first child, the harder it is.
