Happy to help! This stuck out to me:

>I don't know how to make her realize that once in awhile I am going to say something that doesn't quite sit well with her but that there is never any intended malice behind it.

First, what kind of things are you saying to her? And do you apologize for hurting her feelings? It's hard to be objective about your own relationships, but try to take a step back here for a moment. You're noticing a pattern in behavior between your ex and your current friend, right? I would encourage you to try to identify similarities in what they're saying. Your ex having anger problems doesn't negate whatever feelings she had that triggered her anger and lashing out. Her feelings weren't the problem, her actions based on her feelings were the problem. It's important to separate the two I feel.

If you're saying hurtful things, and your friend has expressed that they are hurtful, but you continue to say them that's not very nice, and it's not something that a friend should do. Especially if you don't apologize for saying those things after. Everyone makes missteps in their relationships, the important part is that you learn from them and try to repair the damage. Be careful not to take the stance of, "I'm sorry *you got offended/hurt.*" This removes your responsibility from the situation (it takes two to tango as they say). A more productive stance would be "I'm sorry *I have offended/hurt you.* Let's talk about it so we can both have closure on the issue and better understand each other."

In that situation it could be something as simple as your tone or verbiage that you used. If you don't take responsibility for your part of the interaction though you'll never learn what is *really* bothering your friend. It's quite possible for friends to respectfully disagree on most issues, but if you notice that your friends are consistently being hurt by what you say I would suggest trying to pin-point what you're doing that is causing them to be hurt.
