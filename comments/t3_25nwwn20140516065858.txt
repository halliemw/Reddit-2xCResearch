Sorry, that's what I was trying to explain- and I might be wrong, if you're already quite slim then I agree that there would be no need to point anything out (If you were 400lbs and turned up to work 100lbs, hell yes I would attack you to the point of confusion in praise.)

Some people might have just noticed you look different and decide that you planned do, that it was a choice? That way they're pointing out whatever hard work they think you've put into looking like you do and giving you positive feedback on what you've done.
Obviously they're wrong and won't realise that you're actually going through a hard time, I just wouldn't take anything on the head- plus sometimes people just say that as a compliment regardless since most women are quite happy to be told they look slimmer.
