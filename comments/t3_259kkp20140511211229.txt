Most white people are probably not racists. Going off your other post, it would seem that you *choose * to put up with racist behavior from people around you (your parents), and even modify your life to conform to their racist ideals (dumping your boyfriend).

It's not healthy, it's *definitely* not normal, and it is not OK.
