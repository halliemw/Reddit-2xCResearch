That's my fear.  Many of these "pastors" use every bit of personal information to further inculcate the main donor/recruit and to invade the family.

For example, I know several churches where this would be considered an open invitation to stop by the house, afterward, to continue the discussion (and the pastor's wife may well be the first person to stop by - as the pastor will have sent her to address the "women's part" of the marriage).  Unless a person is ready for that, it can be rather unpleasant.

I'd do research first, and ask pastors of *other* churches with known denominations what they know (they'll know more than almost anyone else).
