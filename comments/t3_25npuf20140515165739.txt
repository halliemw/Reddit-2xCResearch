You literally just said everything I was going to say!

It's really easy to get caught up in your own flaws. I do it, too. Most people don't even notice them. Sometimes I'll be really embarrased about a huge cystic zit and I'm afraid everyone is looking at it and if I say something to one of my coworkers, they'll be like, "Oh, yeah, now that you pointed it out I see it, but didn't until then." Oh. I shouldn't have worried.
