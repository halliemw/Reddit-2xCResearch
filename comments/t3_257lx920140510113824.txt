I have a lunette cup and really like it a lot. It's a bit tricky to get in/out, so I would recommend doing so in the shower the first few times. But it prevents leaks better than any pad or tampon I've worn. It shares with the Sckoon cup the quality of not having a hollow stem, so you can also cut it to adjust the length if it's uncomfortable. Also it comes in different colors!

I honestly do feel like it's way more hygenic than pads/tampons, which end up being these weird fleshy bloody things and bleeech.
