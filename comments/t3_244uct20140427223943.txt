Your medical insurance may cover a visit to an optometrist if your complaint indicates a medically necessary exam/treatment (in this case, a possible abrasion would require medically necessary treatment).  I'm still an optometry student so I don't know too much about insurance, but I'd suggest calling an optometry office to get more details and see what your options are.  Like stated below, you may have to pay out of pocket.  

Injuries like these could go either way: could be pretty shallow or small and heal up, or it could be deeper/bigger and require treatment to help with the pain, healing process, and prevent infections that may be vision-threatening.  Edit: re-read your question - if an infection occurs it could get worse, and if you don't have any other options, definitely see if your normal doctor can do something for you!

Let me know if you have any questions, but I'd really recommend seeing an eye doctor!  Hope everything turns out alright!
