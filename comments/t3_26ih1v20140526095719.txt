Maybe I'm missing something. The specific shape/image that is 'desirable' is different, but it still boils down to unrealistic and usually unhealthy body standards. 

The idealisation of a body shape that is almost impossible to achieve without surgical intervention is bad for all women no matter what skin colour you have.
