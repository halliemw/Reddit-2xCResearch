I think part of the point being made above is that there are tons of non-infant children waiting to be adopted just in the US, so while there may be plenty of couples who would love to adopt OP's potential baby, it would be at the expense of an older child who needs a home. I feel the same way OP does, in that I could never imagine giving birth to a child just to give it up, but even if I felt differently in that regard, I still don't think I would ever want to do it because I think it's really irresponsible to contribute to the already way overcrowded foster care system.
