She's actually a neurologist and it's pretty heavily implied that her bipolar disorder has helped her better understand how sick brains function and thus not only be great at her job but particularly at connecting with her patients. There may be some romanticizing of her bipolar but it's also very good at showing you the bad side at least in my opinion. In episodes where she goes on and off her meds they make it pretty clear that her manic episodes are a nasty nasty business.

She does have a fianc√© but the show in NO way implies that he's all she needs to be fixed. In fact it is largely focused right now on how her problems put a lot of strain on the relationship.

Of course I'm not always good at seeing the broader implications of things so if anyone disagrees feel free to say
