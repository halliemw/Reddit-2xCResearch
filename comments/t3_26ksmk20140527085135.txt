I try to keep my diet as constant as possible. 2 eggs over easy every morning and coffee w/ cream (no sugar). For the day, two more square meals with a good percentage of greens and meat. I think that the best diet for somebody is the one that works. For me, that happened to be a somewhat keto diet of high fat, low carbs (others in the thread may disagree, do what works for you!). Invest time in finding what works for your particular situation, given your scheduling and other lifestyle constraints. I have always been pretty slim, but ever since I have shifted my focus to building my career, I haven't been as attentive to my diet or keeping up an exercise routine. Being passively mindful of one's diet is a good way to keep calories in check, however. I let this set breakfast of eggs and coffee work itself out. Subways also makes salads, and you can build them up with cheese and meat and beans so that they are as filling as the sandwich, without (as many) carbs, but that is just from my perspective. Explore their menu! Lol, I personally love subways, it's so fast and convenient.
