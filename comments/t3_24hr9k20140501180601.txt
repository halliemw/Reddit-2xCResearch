Hmm... maybe I just haven't gotten lucky yet then, heh. 

> I hear from him maybe once a month or so. We're almost complete opposites in every single way and met under the most unlikely of circumstances (here on 2X, actually) but it seems to work. The biggest thing that keeps it going is there no expectation of consistent communication. It happens whenever one of us has something to say or wants to respond.

I guess I have a hard time understanding that. I suppose you don't get to that point until after you've been consistently communicating for awhile right?

I've always been intrigued and wanted internet penpals, but I've honestly never been able to get it to work. If communication isn't consistent, then it just completely stops and I never hear from that person again. =( (And I will take part of the blame too, as sometimes I fade out as well. But they never reach out to me, and if I'm to be fair, I've never tried reaching out either... but I also never found a reason to reach out again.)
