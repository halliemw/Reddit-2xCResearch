My ferritin was at a 1.7. I've now finished a course of iron infusions to help me get my ferritin back up to normal levels. Do you have a hematologist that you're seeing? I would schedule an appt with one if you aren't already. 

I'm also on the pill and don't have heavy periods. My anemia is from being a terrible vegetarian 9 years ago, and from my iron being so so so depleted that even when I began to eat meat, it wasn't enough to get me back to where I needed to be. 

Iron pills can work, but with a ferritin that low, I would assume they would probably start you on infusions since iron pills can wreck havok on your stomach and they aren't the best for absorption of iron. If you are taking pills make sure you're taking them with vitamin c to get the most absorption. 

You can PM me if you have any iron or infusion questions - I've had to become pretty knowledgeable about iron and stuff with everything that's gone on with my body..
