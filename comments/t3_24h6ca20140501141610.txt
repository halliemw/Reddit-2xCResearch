I picked the pill because It's easy for me to remember (I set an alarm on my phone, so take it at the exact same time every day), it's effective, and easy to stop if any side effects start happening. Plus, it has lightened my periods considerably, lessened my cramps, and has made my cycle wonderfully regular.

Frankly, I was worried about not inserting the NuvaRing properly (as I don't use tampons and I'm not really accustomed to sticking stuff up there for extended periods of time), and having it fall out. I was also worried about having the patch fall off, so didn't choose that. I decided against getting an implant, IUD, or birth control shots because if any particularly awful side effects happened, it would be a pain to get off that particular form of birth control.

The only real side effects I suffer are sore breasts for a few days each month, but I just wear a slightly more supportive bra and hold my boobs while walking down stairs. I hope this helps you!
