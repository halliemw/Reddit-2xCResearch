I think you should have a serious conversation with him and explain to him exactly how him interacting with someone in that way makes you feel.  I would guess you'd be uncomfortable if he'd been having the same conversation with another friend that wasn't an ex?  If so, I think you should make it clear that this is not specific to his interactions with her.  Try use phrases that focus on your feelings, like "It makes me feel X when you do Y".  And keep in mind that your emotions are valid simply because you feel them!

Hopefully this is just a case of him not understanding your boundaries in a relationship - I used to date someone with Aspergers and he had some difficulties with this sort of thing.

If he tries to understand where you're coming from and agrees not to continue to have conversations like that while you're together - great!  

In the end though, you can't force him to stop if he doesn't want to.  If you cannot come to an agreement or a compromise, then it may be necessary to reconsider the relationship.
