As someone who used to have highly irregular (both in flow and timing) periods, someone saying, "Oh, I hope this is a light month... *look down* Nope. Bled through again. *sigh* Well, these are now period panties." (On the plus side, yay I can go shopping for new panties!)

1. Not anymore. I used to constantly. I'm on a bc that makes them crazy light.

2. I wear/wore tampons on their own. I hate pads. I hate they way the felt, I hated how the smelled (even unscented smelled weird to me), I hated that if they got any blood on them I felt like I was wearing a dirty diaper. I would rather ruin underwear than feel that.
