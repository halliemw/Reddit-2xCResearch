The point isn't that they weren't aware of it beforehand, it's that this substandard pay has been across the board for so long it's considered acceptable.  To me, it isn't.  These girls are trained athletes, even if most people see them as painted up mannequins.  They audition and have to learn routines at the drop of a hat; that's something I certainly couldn't do.

The physical standards are iffy..  I mean, there obviously need to be standards of appearance for a job like this but a "jiggle test" does have a demeaning ring to it.  Give them a body fat % standard, if you will; have them pass physical exams.  

The derogatory comments they hear from their team's employees are unacceptable and should be dealt with accordingly.
