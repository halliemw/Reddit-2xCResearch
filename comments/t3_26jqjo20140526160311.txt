Find a hobby where you can go hang out. Mine's knitting and my yarn shop has a night to just bring in your project and gab and get help. There's a whole bunch of stuff you can do to go meet people. Take a community class, join a hiking group, take a yoga class, see if your community has a good game store that hosts game days! And don't give up if nobody talks to you right away. Be patient, keep going back, and people will start talking to you as they get used to you.
