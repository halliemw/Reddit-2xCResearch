Maybe I can shed some light to why you're feeling this way. 

What your ex did to you was horrible beyond words and you did not deserve it one bit.  He was supposed to love you and be on your team, but he beat you instead.  Yet you still love him to pieces and despite your bruises, you wished he would stay.  Of course, this is where a lot of people would tell you to walk away, but it isn't so easy, is it?  

The fact your ex realizes what he has done is a good thing.  He's clearly going through some issues right now due to a rough upbringing and it's good he can address his anger.  That doesn't make what he did OK though.

**Why I think a lot of us end up staying**

In the beginning of your relationship, all was well.  And over time, there was a slow drip of emotional abuse.  Such a slow drip, in fact, you hardly notice it coming on and things proceed to feel pretty normal.  You still regard and respect him as your lover because of the "good times" you have had, and the ones you still have.  So you find yourself holding out for the good days.  Waiting around for things to get better - the day when things will be back to normal again, because they weren't always like this.  

**Why I think we sometimes blame ourselves, and make up excuses**

Perhaps you might even blame yourself a bit too and wonder if a part of you deserved that treatment, because the man who used to treat you like a princess in the beginning now treats you like scum.  So you make up excuses as to why it's OK to stay with someone who makes us feel so bad.

**Having the last word**

I know that you feel like *you* should have had the last word.  You deserved to, after all - he was a total pig.  Sometimes having the last word feels a lot like justice.  It's one part of the closure process, and for some of us it can be a big one!  The fact he left you makes you feel cheated.  He's the asshole, not you, and he deserves to be the one who is walked away from because you want him to feel the pain he deserves.  You want him to know that he screwed up and that you were the one who was strong enough to walk away from it.  It's entirely understandable, but you need to remember that that is all it is: having the last word, and walking away feeling empowered from what made you feel powerless.  In short, he humiliated you.

My emotionally abusive ex (also had an abusive childhood) left me the second he found a good reason to.  He cheated on me, but I blamed myself and made excuses as to why his behavior was OK because I figured if things were good in the beginning, there was a specific reason why they weren't anymore.  He abused me emotionally so often that it crushed my ego.  I couldn't stand up for myself because he would find a way to break my confidence whenever I did.  I refused to let him just cheat on me without a fight.  I wanted to prove that I could be an awesome girlfriend and make him feel sorry for what he did.  All I wanted him to do was realize I was a good person, so I stayed with him for five long months until he came up with some dumb reason to break up with me.

And of course he was sorry.  After some time, he realized what he'd lost and understood he fucked up.  But most men do after a while, and some of them may even try to come back to the ones they hurt.  Because when an abuser starts to miss the person they hurt, they think they can be better because RIGHT then and there, they want to be.  But fact of the matter is, if they have found a reason to go that far with you once before, they'll do it again.  It took my girl friend THREE times over four years to figure this out with her physically abusive boyfriend until she finally was able to walk away forever.

It's a long road, but eventually you will learn to get past all the humiliation he left you with and start to understand that what's important is that you're OUT.  It doesn't matter who left who - what matters is you're safe now.  And someday, you're going to find "the one".  He will love and respect you like crazy and you'll wonder why you ever settled for a life with someone who made you feel scared or miserable.
