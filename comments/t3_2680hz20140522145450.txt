>Maybe I'm just out of touch, but I thought that's what dating was for, getting to know a girl and find out if we mesh or not, if there is any connection or not.

I think it probably varies from person to person and time to time, but I figured you'd want to know the person *a little* first. Even a 5 or 10 minute conversation about a thing or two you're interested in.

Maybe that's just because I assume that the majority of strangers, even if they're attractive, are probably not going to be compatible enough with me that I'm going to feel comfortable and happy spending an hour or two alone with them from the get-go.
