I understand there has been a lot of discussion, and I appreciate you showing me a couple of positive reactions. I honestly had not seen any personally yet. 

What I am trying to introduce is a way to poll the response and quantify the consequences. I definitely agree it's not niche, but man reddit is pretty male dominated, not just in numbers but in attitude. Some of the men on this site are downright hostile towards women as a whole, and it's largely accepted. Now people are experiencing it 'in their safe haven'. I already know how I feel about it--I'd really like to get a better grasp on how others feel. Largely because the mods did not consult any of the user base with their decision. 

It would also provide a way for people to put in their opinion as a 1 count, rather than something to be voted on and valued. I think it would provide a better way of getting an idea about how people feel about it.
