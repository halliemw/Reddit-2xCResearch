My apologies I looked it up and i confused the data.  Most habitually homeless people have mental health problems, which is very different then what I said.  You are correct that the number is really substantially below the majority and is more at the 12-30% range.

I do disagree with the other two statements you made though.  Firstly  I am in no way suggesting that she mace anyone that approaches her for change, but she might be more comfortable if she has some kind of nonlethal deterrent.  Secondly the notion that you treat everyone the same is naive.  If you are in a shitty neighborhood in Detroit you will interact with people a lot differently then you would if you were in a upper-middle class suburb of Seattle.

If someone does not realize that approaching a lone woman, at night, in a dark secluded parking lot is not acceptable it is clear that they might not be very aware of social norms.  People who are not aware of social norms act unpredictably, and unpredictable people are frightening.  It would be nice if danger did not exist, but the fact of the matter is we live in a dangerous world and precautions should be taken to minimize risk.

If you want to help the homeless volunteer or donate to charities, I myself volunteer a few hours every week at a local food bank.  There are ways to help people in this world that do not involve putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation.
