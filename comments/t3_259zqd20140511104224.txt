My husband and I do something similar - plus, we feel so lucky to have each other that neither of us is concerned about the other finding someone more desirable. We were at a shooting range and I gather (I didn't see it, I was looking at my target!) a number of guys peered over at my booth to check out my behind while I was benching a rifle. A friend who was with us cracked up when he looked over at my husband and saw the look on his face, which was basically (pardon the crudeness), "heh. I get to tap that,".

Another big thing for me is recognizing that you absolutely will meet other people you're attracted to. What matters is that instead of having an existential crisis over what-ifs, you can just say to yourself, "who cares what my life might be like if I'd met this guy instead of my partner. I'm happy, and that's what matters."
