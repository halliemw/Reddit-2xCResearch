There are 50,000+ 5-digit CPT codes used in health insurance billing.  The provider has to choose the exact right code or else the claim is automatically denied.  Each insurance company has their own set of policies on which codes are denied and which codes are accepted based on A) the provider's contract with the insurance company and B) the patient's benefit plan.  The company I worked for had obscure rules based on random Medicare policies published in god-knows-what year.  Sometimes a claim was denied and even as an employee I could never find out exactly why.  Also, health insurance companies sometimes use third party contractors to process claims, and many of these claims are not reviewed by the company before being officially processed.

Health insurance companies suck.
