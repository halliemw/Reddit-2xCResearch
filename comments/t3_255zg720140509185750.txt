You go, and you enjoy every damn moment you get with them.  It's rough, especially at the beginning, when there is no sleep and when they seem to just poop and throw up, and when the two of you are on edge as you try like hell to figure out what you do with this new small life that you are suddenly responsible for.

But remember, every moment you get is a damn gift.  And it's scary how easily and how quickly that gift can be lost.  

There was a moment three years ago, where I was sitting in the car, telling my then 4 year old daughter about a song I happened to listen to a few hours after she was born: "Hands held high" by Linkin Park.  

There is a line in the song that says "With hands held high into the sky so blue, and the ocean opens up to swallow you."  I told her that I had just seen her born, and for some reason, as I listened to that line and thought of her, I realized that beauty had just come back into the world.  She wanted to hear the song, and I played it as I reached back and held her leg. As that line came on I looked back and saw her eyes, full of tears, as she smiled at me. 

I have held that moment close to me ever since then. 

Congrats on being a new father!  "Daddy" is one of the hardest and most wonderful names you will ever earn.
