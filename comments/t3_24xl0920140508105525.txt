And I'm okay with a trained lawyer or judge quantifying evil but I feel that if everyone went around making value judgements aboutnthe finer sfferences of rape some forms of rape would be disqualified as " real rape". It's not like I a, nitpicky for no reason, people DO sometimes treat non-violent rapes as somehow not as worthy of the title of rape.
