There's a reason this guy has been working alone and hired you despite lack of experience (I'm sure you're awesome, but let's be real, most employers value experience). He's driven away everyone else who tried to work with him.

Look for other jobs now. If you can hang on until you have something else, that's great, but this guy is looney.
