>This implies my doctors all think my ovaries will override my brain one day, which is just extra fucked up.

I don't want to be an asshole, but do you understand how hormones and the brain work? You are already on antidepressants so it is clear that you do not have full control over your brain. You are requiring pharmacological intervention in order to control your brain. If I was a doctor, I would be extra hesitant to perform an operation like this on someone on antidepressants.

Start seeing a psychiatrist if you aren't already. Let them know your intentions. See what they think. I just think it is really odd that you know you don't control your brain, but you get offended when doctors say you don't control your brain.
