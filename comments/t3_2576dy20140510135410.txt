I apologise if my assumption on statistics was wrong, it's anecdotal based on the fact that where I live I have literally never met a man who has been circumcised, even jewish and muslim men that I know are not circumcised here. Unfortunately it is very difficult to get accurate stats on FGM here.  If you watch the documentary you will realise that the illegality of FGm makes absolutely zero difference to how common the practice is. 

The practices are done for very different reasons, and that is why I think they need to be treated separately. Just saying 'do not circumcise' does *nothing* as we already know. I believe we need to target the reasons these things are done, otherwise they will never stop. 

FGM is done when girls are old enough to feel the pain and are often traumatised by it. It is done not for any safety or healthy or hygiene reasons, but to stop the girls from enjoying sex, so that they do not want to have sex with anyone until their husband asks for it. They cannot even masturbate. 

Male circumcision does not involve intense pain, and it typically done when they child is too young to understand. It does not prevent the ability to feel pleasure and it does not remove the desire to have sex or masturbate. 

So while I agree that unwanted male circumcision is bad, I do not think the two are in any way similar enough to be 'solved' together.
