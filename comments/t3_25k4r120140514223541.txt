If you want to keep your baby, then keep your baby, single moms have made it before, and you can too. If you feel abortion is best for you, then go that way, it is your body, your choice. Just because someone isn't the most financially sound and facing some obstacles doesn't mean they can't be a fantastic parent. 

Please do yourself a favor and talk to a professional before making your decision. I know some people say that they don't feel bad about their abortions(which is fine), but you don't know how you'll react. Weigh all of your options, no matter what you decide, you have it in you to get through it. ((Hugs))
