There aren't many safe places for women. I see this as a kind of destruction of one which is really tragic.

Instead of a subreddit where you can vent about getting harassed in ways others immediately understand, you're having to constantly educate people (at best) and deal with additional harassment instead of support.

MODS - your "lack of time to make an informed decision" holds absolutely no sway for me. This is a COMMUNITY and you're acting like dictators, gambling with a safe space for women. There was nothing wrong with twoX so what on earth were you trying to "fix" by making it a default? It's never been a "let's educate people on the basics of feminism" - it's been a safe place for discussion with people that have similar experiences.

You've basically created a situation to bring higher visibility to individuals who in some cases have to dig deep just to talk about their experiences anywhere - much less in the reddit spotlight. Why on earth would you open up your community members to a much higher level of PM harassment than they would otherwise experience? You can't control that with your super-mod powers.

Creating a safe place is at odds with putting that space on display for the masses. You can't have it both ways.
