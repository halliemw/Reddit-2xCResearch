Seriously, the blood!  YES!  There's a reason we get so winded and dizzy.  Our blood pressure is extremely low while blood volumes are increasing.  I've damn near passed out a few times, and from doing simple things like, oh, standing up?  Fun!  ;)  

I really think people who make 'articles' like this (I'm hesitant to even give this credibility as journalism in any way, as it's clearly not) need to understand things about pregnancy.  Like what it means when you get told "if you do not take it easy, I am putting you on bed rest."  

That means I *have* to sit my ass down and take it slow.  If I don't, I risk harm to myself and my unborn kid.  We've worked very hard for this pregnancy and had many losses. 

I'll be damned if I'm going to actively do something that might harm this.
