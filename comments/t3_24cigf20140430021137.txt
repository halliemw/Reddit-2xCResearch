Well, with a Bachelor in Fine Arts you probably will never have a career to meet people. Do you have friends? You said you found solace in male friends. Men have women. You can be friends with their girlfriends/wives. Men also tend to just know at least a few women. That's how I know all my friends. It's less to due with finding that magical social place where people find soul mate friends, and more just be willing to go to social gatherings.
