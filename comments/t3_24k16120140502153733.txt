[This is the exact tutorial I used.](http://rufflebuttcosplay.deviantart.com/art/How-to-make-Armor-with-Foam-Sheets-and-Fabric-359304061) It's contact cement. My only recommendation is to make sure you use metal palette knives so it's easier to clean / wash the gunk off. Also, work outdoors because the fumes from the contact cement is gross. 

And, if you need to glue pieces together use the following guideline:

* **Vinyl to vinyl** : [super glue](http://www.krazyglue.com/images/default-source/Product-Thumbnails/kg825-thumbnail.jpg?sfvrsn=0) or [PVA glue](http://static.hardwarestore.com/media/product/126951_front500.jpg) - this is the exact brand I used


* **Vinyl to foam** : Use the contact cement. I used the same brand that was in the tutorial.

* **Foam to foam** : Use a hot glue gun. 
 
EDIT: I also run a cosplay blog so if you need any more costuming advice, feel free to ask :)
