I could help but laugh/gag when I read the part about drinking your period blood. Lol.
    I have had a similar experience with having a condom stuck in my love hole. We got done having sexy times and noticed the condom has disappeared. I stood up to look and then **BAM** it slid right out. So. Embarrassing. Thanks for sharing your story and letting me know I am not alone! :)
