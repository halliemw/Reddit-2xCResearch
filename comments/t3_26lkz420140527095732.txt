Notes on the boots and socks. The best boots I've ever owned are [Danner boots](http://www.danner.com/boots). They run a bit pricey; However, good boots are super important and some firms will reimburse boot purchases. 

Regarding the socks, I actually prefer wool, but if you're going with cotton try to get pain white ones or ones with little to no dye as sometime the dye can come out of cheaper socks if you're sweating all day.
