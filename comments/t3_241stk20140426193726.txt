I think the bio majors at most major US universities usually have a higher percentage of female students! This is mostly due to premeds in my experience, but still. I was a biochemistry major in undergrad and have worked in two labs since then. I have never witnessed nor experienced any negative treatment towards woman in science. 


Compared to other STEM courses, I've found success in biology classes depends much more on hard work vs innate skill since most the of the classes involve a good deal of memorization. To be successful as a biologist, you need to be very well read and knowledgeable about your field of study. Essentially, as long as you put the work in, you should be just fine!
