I think letting your daughter see you be insulted and verbally abused and you not do anything about it is more harmful than anything.  You are training her to be a victim.  I think from now on, each and every time he says something hurtful you need to say something like, "That is not true.  I do have some self esteem and that really hurts my feelings.  I treat you with respect and I expect the same from you."

Also sometimes a husband needs a kick in the pants and a wife needs to let him know what is expected of him.  The weekend before next mother's day you need to ask him, "What are you doing for Mother's Day this year?"  Then tell him he should take the kid to the store on such and such day to pick out a card and to buy you something nice like chocolates or a scarf or something and let the kid help pick it out.  After a few years of this training he might even start doing it on his own.
