I have no idea why the police officer reached the conclusion that he did, that "no foul play was identified", but he not only has the right to ask the questions he did, he SHOULD ask the questions he did.

Reporting a rape isn't easy.  If the police can gather enough evidence to arrest the perp and put him on trial, you can be guaranteed that his defense attorney is going to ask all those same questions and more.  The police need to ask those questions to get the answers to them so that the prosecutor can be prepared for what will happen in court.  They need to know the answers to those questions ahead of time in court so that they aren't surprised and so that the defense attorney has less of a chance of some surprise introducing reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds.

The questions needed to be asked.  But, your friend needs to ask how the conclusion of "no foul play was identified" was reached when she explicitly pushed the guy away.
