Absolutely. I went through a super plus tampon every 2 hours on the heaviest days, and with the Diva Cup I will last 7 hours before having to change it on the heavy days. It honestly makes a huge difference to your life. Being able to last the entire night (7 hours) without having to think about it vs. having to get up every 2 hours makes a world of difference.


I just made the switch last month and I am so happy I did. It's definitely worth giving it a try.
