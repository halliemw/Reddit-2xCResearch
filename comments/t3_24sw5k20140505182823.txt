Big, big internet hugs to you. I went through something similar 7 years ago. I was with a guy for 3 years. We lived together and were planning a life together when I found out he had been cheating on me the whole time. To make matters worse, I found out that he was bi-sexual, cheating with both guys and girlsl (Not that there's anything wrong with bi-sexuality!). The fact that I had NO IDEA he was interested in guys as well as girls threw me for such a loop. I'm short, athletic and had a very short haircut at that time. After we broke up I was plagued by the question of whether or not he was only interested in me because I looked like a boy. I felt so horribly unattractive and ... neutered. I thought of all the times I had felt sexy in the past and felt like such a fool for believing that anyone found me desirable. I was seriously messed up.

The good part about this story is that I got over it. Seriously. It took a few years, a few good friends, a LOT of wine and finding a very patient new guy to help me get my groove back. You can get over this too. It won't be fast and it won't be easy, but you'll come out the other side. Every time it hurts and you start doubting yourself remember that tomorrow you'll be one day further away from the bad times and one day closer to the good times. All you have to do is keep living and one day he won't matter anymore.
