You must be a really good gamer since you've been doing it for so long. :) The big thing is, guys should not feel emasculated when women beat them. We are simply fellow game players. We are not out to steal your testosterone. The sexual harassment is the worst, but then there's the "go back to the kitchen" or "this is how women are ruining the [insert name] community/workforce!" Or how a good portion of the female avatars are wearing underwear when they go around in the games.
