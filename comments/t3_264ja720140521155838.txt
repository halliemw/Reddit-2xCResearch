The funny part is that I've tested myself for diabetes, coeliac disease, yeast inside my guts, general STD's and done blood work for all the general health stuff. This is why I'm also at the end of my rope, everything has been checked and I'm in great shape otherwise.

Thank you for your suggestion.
