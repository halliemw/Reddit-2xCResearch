Most states have a horrible backlog of evidence and it often takes years to process it. Meanwhile, more crimes are being committed by the offenders while they are walking the streets. It makes me so mad!!! If states would put more funding into processing DNA evidence they would save so much time and money by preventing other crimes from happening, not to mention preventing countless victims from being harmed. It's such bullshit! I'm so sorry that happened to you and that it took so long and I hope you can get some closure.
