It does sometimes happen early, but remember that it can go on for awhile and the whole thing is (as usual) unpredictable.  

Certainly, hormonal changes can happen throughout our life (sometimes caused by stress).  The good news is that not all of us have much trouble with menopause.  I don't miss having periods.  My best friend and I had the same experience (of barely noticing), she has certain chronic health issues and is always concerned about every aspect of her body - but no major hot flashes.  We both have trouble sleeping.  

There is some research to show that the mid-30's can bring hormonal transitions on their way to menopause, but it's entirely possible it's just this one time, for now, and that you may have irregular periods from now on (fun, right?)  

Do you notice anything else?  (e.g., changes in sex drive, fuzzy thinking, sleeplessness, etc.?)  Not everyone experiences all of those things (increase in sex drive is not uncommon in the mid-30's, btw) but each woman is different.  

If you are in fact pre-menopausal, it's a bit early for you and while it's nothing to get super concerned about (the alternatives, such as hormonal therapy, have to be weighed very carefully) but do mention it at your next ob-gyn appointment.

(It takes about 10 years from the first signs of menopause to get to where one is fully through it, if that's helpful - that is, if you have intact ovaries).
