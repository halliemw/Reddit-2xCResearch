I agree with friskyspatula. This has gone beyond a hobby. What he's doing now is pretty much a financial death sentence. It would be like me taking out loans to buy the extremely expensive camera lenses I would love to have (for reals. The one I want most is $3,500).  
  
Plus, he needs to spend time with you if you're a couple. That's why my husband now only works at the paintball field every other weekend if he's asked to, so we get time together, and I can have a bit of a break from our son.  
  
I'd try and talk to him about it again first. If he still didn't get it, I'd walk away.
