Thank you for sharing. I will seek family counseling. My sister wants to be with me, and she wants to get better. She's always wanted to be with me, my sister does not trust her father. He thinks that she is making these problems up. When she was 4, she made a comment that he touched her in a bad way, but my mother did not push the issue after reporting it and no charges were made. Her father left the state after this.
The courts still placed her with him because that was not brought up in court due to lack of evidence, and he was a "non offending parent".
