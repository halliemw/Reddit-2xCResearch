You know, now I really want to do it! I wore a small, short tiara for my wedding, and I've always kept it around for god knows what. Now I know it's because it's my destiny to be a "princess butcher"! My shop is in a farmers' market so I won't be open again til next Thursday, but I will definitely get some pics of that!
