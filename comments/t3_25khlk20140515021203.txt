This seems to be general group mentality. Anyone not thought to be "in" the group gets treated differently. From different genders to ages to races and beyond, all without noticing they're doing it.

Some groups may not have as strong of connection to each other and may not act this way as much, but tight nit groups such as families can act very exclusive.
