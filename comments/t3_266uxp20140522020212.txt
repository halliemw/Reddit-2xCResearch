How can I as a fiance and soon to be husband communicate my understanding? From a clinical level I understand BPD quite well, and I understand that it potentially will never get "better" in the sense of the word. I also know that with a lot of counseling that quality of life can definitely improve. I know these things from my story as someone who is going strong and will be in recovery for life with Dependent Personality Disorder.

Tripwireforsale as someone who suffers from a personality disorder and has been working it out for close to 6 years now. It is a very slow process but life does improve. (I still have "episodes" of DPD) If you would like to talk on that side of things I am willing to as well.
