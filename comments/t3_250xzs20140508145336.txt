Quit being so dramatic. You weren't there and neither was I. Your past experiences/anti-man views don't define every situation. Point is, escalating a situation to violence against a drunk person (male or female) that is becoming billigerent creates a more violent scenario. It's called logic. If you actually read what she wrote, immediately after she slapped him, he hit her. The correct way to handle someone that isn't making sense in your car and is getting angry/physical is to agree and yes them to death so no argument develops. Then you drop them off and leave ASAP.
