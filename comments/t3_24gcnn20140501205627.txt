Does anyone know any male-equivalents? Like, what are some good books that really show a boy how to 'be a man' and the 'brotherhood' and so on? In a healthy way. I've heard Dead Poet's Society is a good example. Things that explore having male role models and growing up a boy. 

I'm a girl, so I've been exposed to all these 'I am woman!' kind of attitudes. But, I'm not sure if I've been exposed to 'I am man!' to see the real kind of struggles that boys go through growing up and being an adult. Outside the whitewashed mainstream things that just show a prettied up version of stories that just happen to have the main character as a guy.
