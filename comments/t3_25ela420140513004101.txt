Breasts are not inherently sexual. Actually, in Canada and Sweden it's legal for women to walk around topless. In Canada, for example, criminal obscenity laws don't apply to bare breasts because the courts have found that breasts themselves aren't obscene. 

If bare breasts make you uncomfortable, suck it up. Sometimes other people's body parts make me uncomfortable too. You know what? That uncomfortableness is entirely my problem - not their problem - because I have no right to dictate what what other people wear, unless they're on my property. 

Also, please don't use the word "tit." People in this thread are trying to have a serious discussion. Please use your grown up language.
