I did not and would not say that only the female perspective matters.

However, I do not see "caucasianism," or the explicit prioritizing of a group whose perspective is already prioritized, as equal to feminism. In fact, feminism arose in response to the observation that in many areas of study, female perspectives, as well as female test subjects and a critical examination of gendered assumptions, were lacking.
