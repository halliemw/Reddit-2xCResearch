It sounds silly but I think you guys need to sit down and talk about how you do chores and why you do it the way you do. Not just a conversation about who does what but how you actually do them step by step. Sometimes saying "I do something this way because..." can help you get on the same page about things.  

For example having four or five sorts in your laundry system doesn't make a ton of sense to a guy who only wears tshirts and jeans. He doesn't want to mess up your system but he doesn't understand it so he doesn't do it. If you explain the reasoning behind it (washing tank tops with jeans can ruin the straps etc) it's not just some mysterious girl thing.
