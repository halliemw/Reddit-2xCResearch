quit treating guys like you would treat women, its just as disrespectful as treating women like you would treat guys. tell him "i promise that under no situation will i ever have sex with you for any reason period." 

the bluntness and the honesty is the biggest favor you can do for him. if you don't make it absolutely clear, than he will always have to question if he could have done something different. 

if you want to be extra nice, tell him with no ambiguity exactly what his actions were that made you toss him off of the list of people you might potentially have sex with. this will empower him to change his behavior and not make the same mistake with another girl. 

this would be very mean to do to a girl. but it is the most respectful thing you can do for a guy. i am a guy. trust me, i am telling you the harsh truth of men, we are painfully honest, and we do it out of respect for each other.
