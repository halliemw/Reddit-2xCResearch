You can do eeeeet!!! Research a trade your interested in and start applying for jobs! Be prepared to deal with some assholes, chauvinists or even worse, the guys who try and do all the heavy lifting for you... but they aren't as common as you think, and a good sense of humor combined with a stiff upper lip will put them in their place! 

If you have any questions at all, I would love to answer them! Good luck and remember you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to!! :D
