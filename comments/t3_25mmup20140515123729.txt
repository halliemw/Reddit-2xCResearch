There is supposed to be *both* a police investigation, for criminal punishment, *and* a campus investigation, to decide on disciplinary/safety/expulsion matters.  The reason there should be both is that the university has a duty to provide a safe environment, and uses a different standard of proof than the criminal investigation.  So even if the police can't prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that the accused rapist is guilty (or even if they decline to follow up on the matter at all), the university may still find that there's sufficient evidence for them to expel that student, or take other action to protect the victim.

The problem is that many victims go to the administration *instead* of the police, often with an assumption that this is what they're supposed to do, or that the administration will help them initiate criminal proceedings or that these are the same process.  Victims are not well educated about the process and do not receive the help they need in this situation to make sure things are handled correctly, and administrations often fail to provide that help because a criminal investigation is disruptive and bad for their reputation.
