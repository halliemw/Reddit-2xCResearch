I'd recommend caution to a certain extent.  As a big guy myself I once decided to stand up to the guy in the checkout line in front of me who started hurling racial epithets at the clerk.  This rather small, old, drunk fool decided to turn his attention to me and retrieve his gun from his trunk outside.

I made it out just fine, but I did learn a lesson that day. The lesson wasn't "never stand up for someone," it was "you can never really tell who is just crazy and who is REALLY fucking crazy."
