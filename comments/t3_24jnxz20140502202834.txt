Congrats!  My dream car is the Nissan NV 12 passenger van.  I used to think I would grow up and drive a cute sports car and now I'm saving up for a NV so my whole family can fit in our car.  
Finally getting the right car for you is awesome.  Enjoy your new ride and don't waste a second worrying about what anyone else thinks.
