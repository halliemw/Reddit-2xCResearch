I stayed at an Airbnb apartment in Harlem (146th) a couple of weeks ago! At first I was a little hesitant when I found out where it exactly was.. but it had awesome reviews regarding safety, location and cleanliness of the apartment (it was kinda loud in the mornings but when you're dead tired from the night before, you can sleep through anything) . I went for it and had an awesome time! I felt like one of the locals :) The host was very accommodating and replied/called me back in a timely manner.
