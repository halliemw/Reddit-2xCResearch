Good for you! This reminds me of my fiance and I. I'm entering a Medicinal Chemistry PhD program weeks after our wedding this summer at my dream school. My fiance agreed to follow me to wherever I wanted to go to ensure I had the best opportunities possible. This meant that he had to wait to apply for jobs until I was accepted and also he couldn't apply for his dream jobs wherever he wanted. I'm so happy he was willing to do that for me. As a bonus, in the future when we have children, I could end up being the main breadwinner for our family. My fiance is ok with that and actually really likes the idea of him being the one at home or with a part-time career. It's great when you find someone who you love and who loves you enough to sacrifice things for your success. Eventually I find some way to repay him, but right now I just make sure he knows how grateful I am. I'm happy you also found a keeper.
