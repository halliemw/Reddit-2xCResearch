I think there's a big difference between calling someone beautiful / commenting on their physical attractiveness is a lot different than complimenting someone on their taste / hair / clothes / makeup / shoes / sense of humor / intelligence / eloquence / talents / anything that they have actual control over or that reflects them as a person. 

At work today a man told me I had beautiful hair (I had done a forties roller set that morning). He and his wife told me how much I look like his mother had looked in the forties, and told me a little bit about her and her life. He told me that the next time they come in he'll bring a photo so I can see her. It was the highlight of my day and I look forward to seeing them again. 

When you compliment someone on something they've done deliberately, you can have a conversation. Compliments on beauty / attractiveness are different. It sometimes comes off as "hey, I find you physically appealing and I want to make you acknowledge my that attraction." and then them waiting for a response.
