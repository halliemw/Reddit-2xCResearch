My vagina is not a product of my imagination, it does exist, I am a woman. Pretending that something doesn't exist does not make it disappear. The thing is my vagina shouldn't define my entire humanity.  We should be able to express our gender any way we please, but it is each of ours to express or not to. I don't believe the fight for equality should strive for complete sameness. We are not all the same gender or the same color or the same height, we don't all eat the same food or listen to the same music or think about or even care about the same things. And that's really ok because we are all human. We don't need to have concrete definitions of ourselves or label everything but we can give ourselves the labels that we want if we wish to do so. Complete and total sameness may lead to complete and total equality but that kind of takes a step back from freedom and is well boring ... I mean who enjoys wearing a uniform.
