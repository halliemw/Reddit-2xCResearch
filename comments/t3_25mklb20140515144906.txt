I don't think the company should be expected to pay her more or give her an award. I was just protesting your equivalence of salary and merit. How much she is paid depends on a lot of things other than the quality of her work. I'm not advocating a different system of setting salaries, because I don't have anything to suggest basing them on. But I wish people would acknowledge that the fact that she didn't qualify for the same salary as Bill Keller's fails to take into account other forms of merit, ones that made her worth having around.

If you read about what the paper accomplished under her leadership, it's pretty clear she HAS been killing it. And from an ethical standpoint, the fact that she didn't get along with management because they were forcing editorial leadership to let the paper's business decisions influence reporting is a point in her favor, even though it contributed to her firing. People complained about the way she chose to allot time to her various responsibilities, but as I said, the paper's revenues have increased under her leadership, so she must have been doing something right. I just don't think making an ill-advised bid for a raise detracts enough from her demonstrated virtues as an editor to justify kicking her unceremoniously to the curb. Getting fired when you made a good-faith effort to do your job well sucks. She may not have earned Bill Keller's salary, but she deserved better than she got.
