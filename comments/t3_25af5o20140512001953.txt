Lost my mom when I was 6. I'm very sorry for your loss and can sympathize with the bummer mothers day can be. It's wonderful that you were able to find your baby book and that she took the time to write your birth out in such detail.

My parents also separated before my mom passed away, and most of my childhood things and my mom's things have gone missing or been thrown away. I got my mom's hope chest from a relative 2 years ago. There were tons of pictures, love notes from my dad (they had been high school sweet-hearts), some of my old baby clothes and shoes etc. 

It's a wonderful feeling to know how much your mom loved you, to be able hold it and feel it even after they're gone.
