Good question.  I never really thought about all the "invisible" things many women in households automatically do but you're totally right. This happens in my house too with my husband - if I ask him to clean a toilet, he'll happily do it but he'll just scrub the bowl . . .somehow he doesn't know/see that there are other parts of a toilet that need cleaning.  Same with food - if I didn't cook dinner every night he would just eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches daily. 

I don't have an answer for you but I guess I would start with having a conversation with him about the things that need to be done on a regular basis, make a list together and if you have to create a schedule/calendar of tasks and whose turn it is to take care of something.  It might seem silly to have to do that but that way there aren't any misunderstandings or resentment building up.  Good luck and props for bringing up a subject that a lot of folks probably need to discuss.
