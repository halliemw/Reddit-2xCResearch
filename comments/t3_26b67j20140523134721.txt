I'm not married, and don't wear any rings. I have never told anyone I'm married, for that purpose or any other - not that anyone is likely to believe that anyway since I barely look 18, haha. I have said "I have a boyfriend" (which is the truth) but only when someone is being very persistent and repeating "no, not interested" isn't working...although I'm more likely to try "fuck off" before "I have a boyfriend".
