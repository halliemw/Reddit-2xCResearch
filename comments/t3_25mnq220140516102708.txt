It is so heartbreaking to see a newborn in distress- especially when everyone is telling you to just keep trying to nurse. If I have another child, I'm going to try breastfeeding again, but I will not beat myself up over it if I can't. It added so much stress and definitely contributed to my post-partum depression.
