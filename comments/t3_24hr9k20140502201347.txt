Thanks for responding :)

One of the meetups is a trivia group that's just open to anyone, and there's another that's all about board games. Both are things I enjoy and am fairly good at. So hopefully I'll get myself to one of those soon and make a few acquaintances.

I hope you find people too. Loneliness sucks :/
