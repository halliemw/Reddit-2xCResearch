Actually, I think this is the most encouraging post here. Thanks!  I don't know why I feel better that YOU had an irritable, slightly crazy mom, but it does!
I guess you're right about people - you're gonna get varieties no matter who you are.  I'm just prayin my friends don't treat me any differently :(
