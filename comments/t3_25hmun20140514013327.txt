Has happened to me. I tried to explain how the brain *doesn't* work to a CS major. He would have none of it and asked how I knew. I told him I had studied biochem, neurochemistry, neuropsychology, physiology etc. His comment? I still don't believe you. Interestingly enough, when a guy (who had not studied anything brain related either) said to him I was right, he just bought everything.
