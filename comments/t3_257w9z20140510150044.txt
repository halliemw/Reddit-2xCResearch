Hi, as a guy (*Prepares for onslaught of downvotes*), I agree you came on a bit aggressive. I feel as a man feminism can come across as being scary or anti-male and it can really make guys feel a bit defensive straight off the bat, because when accusing something of being anti-feminist it almost feels like an attack on the men involved with it an by extension all men. Most guys I know are all for female equality, and it can feel almost like a personal attack and can make feel you're being tarnished with the same brush as the (hopefully) minority of men. 

I can sympathise a lot with the guy on facebook because it's not that he's disagreeing with feminism, more that picking on a film like Frozon (Which I love and sang the them tune for like a week) can just seem a bit over the top. At least the film is trying to place more emphasis on the female characters, and I can't really see how it represents women badly. One of them is a queen in control of an entire kingdom who can shoot magical ice beams, she's a total bad ass, and the other is sweet and caring and enthusiastic. 

The characters do however have flaws like you pointed out, but surely that just makes them more human? It's about their life experiences that made them who they are and their individual characters, not just about portraying them as weak and flawed. If you look in the media in general you'll be able to find plenty of useless, weak or stupid male characters and a few strong women I'm sure. Though I admit there's still a gap in the amount of women who are portrayed as strong compared to the men. 

All in all I think most men want to try and support feminism, but you need to try and take a slightly softer approach, and try and help men see it from you'r perspective and we'll try and help you see it from ours. Just because someone doesn't agree with one small feminist article it doesn't mean that they don't support feminism as a whole.
