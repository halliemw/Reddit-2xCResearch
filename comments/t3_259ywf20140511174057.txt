Men can be bridezillas too. And I stand by my comment. 

Bridezillas are those that put their personal role as bride above all other people and concerns. Which you have advocated repeatedly in this thread. When a civil, easy conversation could clear this up in about five seconds.

But clearly civil conversations are not your forte.
