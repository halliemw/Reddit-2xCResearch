We just learned about the origins of home ec classes in my class at college. Apparently it started in the 1920s as an attempt to help people take domestic labor more seriously and understand what all went into it. Home economics courses included biology, accounting, and nutrition. The idea was cleaning and cooking and whatnot would be more effective and healthy if the women understood the scientific basis behind it, and that people in general would take domestic labor more seriously once they understood the effort that went into it.

Fun fact: Apparently the Mother's Movement (which promoted home ec courses) started because the rise of available employment for women in other industries meant that there was a sudden dearth in domestic servants. Suddenly middle class women who had relied on maids/ cooks/ nannies to manage the minutiae of childcare and housework found themselves responsible for it all. So in response, those women formed the Mother's Movement and tried to get everyone to take domestic labor seriously.

Obviously, they failed. That makes me kind of sad.
