Yes, most woman get cysts on their ovaries throughout life for one reason or another but most are not bothered by them. I thought it was ridiculous as well when she said that but I have found most women that I know have had a cyst or two on their ovaries st some point. PCOS is common but it's only become a problem that has been recognized in the last 10 years or so. Many gynecologists that I have seen actually believe heredity may have a large part to play as well. In my family I am fourth generation to have cysts on my ovaries.  They took my great grandma and grandmothers out after discovering them, full hysterectomy by the age of 30. It was a different time though. My mother had them when she was younger but they went away after having children. I have no children and its only gotten worse as I get older. I have had many doctors inform me that if I was to have children it could go away completely or get worse. There is no way of knowing because they still don't understand what causes the condition. I have been dealing with it for so long that I have done a lot of study on it and even gone as far as to do a research project when I was in college.  I found that 2 out of 20 woman NEVER had ovarian cysts but the other 17 did at some point. This was a day of speaking with random woman willing to take a survey at a park so the age ranges were quite large.  Youngest I spoke to was 16 and oldest I spoke to was 63. I mean you know what they say, statistics are a lie but I found that one to be pretty accurate in the end.
