Yeah soul crushingly so haha. My biggest challenge right now is my 34 year old male boss's ego. Soooo hard to disagree with him without making him get defensive. But it's what you gotta do! Today I ended up saying "Oh I liked your idea of A. (which I didn't).  It gave me these two ideas, B and C. Which one do you think would work best?" Gives him the authority to choose, easy out for being less correct. Easy as pie.
