My friend and I talked about it a little. There was some anxiety/depression stuff playing into this on her end - which I actually understand pretty well. So I had asked her to just be honest about what was going on - not to make up excuses or say that she was going to come out if she wasn't. (A lot of the time, it was really weird excuses for canceling and it was clear something else was going on.)
This stuff is not really easy to change and it wasn't really something she was working on - and because it made things really stressful trying to include her, I stopped asking her to things. She was never someone who initiated spending time or planned anything on her own, so as soon as the effort stopped on my end - that was pretty much it. But one person can't carry a friendship! I'm not mad about it and I generally wish her well, but it was an unnecessarily stressful situation and it's healthier (for me) to have let it go.
