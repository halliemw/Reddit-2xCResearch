It reminds me of [keratosis pilaris](http://www.dermadoctor.com/blog/keratosis-pilaris/). I have it on my arms and legs. Each hair follicle looks like it has a reddish spot under it. There isn't really any quick fix for keratosis pilaris. I'd suggest seeing a dermatologist though, for definitive answers.
