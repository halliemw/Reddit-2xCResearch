Each of you brings something different to the table. In this I mean that while you may know when, how, and who to call to get the carpet cleaned; I'm sure that your soon to be husband has similar things that he knows more about and accomplishes are the home that you do not. 

And unless your husband has been babied all of his life I'm sure he knows how to keep a pantry full or cook a meal, that is satisfactory to him. That is just a natural thing that everyone learns once they leave their parents house. He probably feels that his version of a meal wouldn't be satisfactory for you, because I know that I personally have made some terrible meals for myself that I ate because I was hungry and too lazy to cook anything else.
