Are there down times when she's alone that he might not think of? For example, when a friend of mine was in a similarly controlling relationship, she would call or text me on her 20 minute commute home from work. Then she would delete the texts or call record from her phone, because he would look through her phone as soon as she got home. That way we could regularly check in (and I could help her work up to leaving him) without him knowing. The tricky part is just setting up the initial arrangement.
