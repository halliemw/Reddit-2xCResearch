I don't know if I have any actual advice for you..
If it's a deal-breaker for him, that's terribly sad. It sounds like you two have a good life together. But if it's truly a deal-breaker it might be good that it happened now rather than further down the road... Do you think someone/something "planted" this idea in his head? I don't know if it was really out of the blue..

I really hope it works out, you shouldn't have to try to alter your belief/disbelief.. and neither should he.. Hopefully he will come to his senses and see what a great thing he's got going.
