And really, how many of those are basing their preference on actual women rather than photos on the internet? 

Sure, some men have a preference for a certain grooming style, but I can't imagine an adult for whom it would be an actual issue. I prefer my husband trimmed, but sometimes he's not. Makes literally no difference in my level of attraction/ sexual enjoyment/etc.
