Hi! First of all, give your girlfriend loads of love and support from me - I've found so much strength during my own battle with endo from others who are fighting the disease and I want to spread that around as much as I can. If she's a Redditor, you might want to point her in the direction of /r/endo, which is an amazing, supportive community. You might find it helpful as well, to read about others' experiences and get some answers for your questions!

Honestly, you seem incredibly supportive and concerned, and that makes me really happy. Having a SO that always had my back was so vital while I was going through the process of finding an endo treatment that worked for me - I got frustrated and depressed and terribly upset during that period of time and his support made things so much better than they could have been. So you're already doing a great job! :)

As far as the BC problem is concerned, encourage your girlfriend to ask about other forms (besides the Pill) at her doctor's appointment. Some endo sufferers do really well with the Depo-Provera shot, which is another form of birth control, and still others do well with an IUD. There are other hormonal treatments, too, which won't function as birth control but can ease the symptoms of endo (Lupron is one of these - it's a shot that basically simulates menopause in the body). Like you said, her doctor will likely know best. Encourage her to make a list of questions and concerns to take into her appointment beforehand so she doesn't forget anything. And if she's unsatisfied with her options, a second opinion might be what she needs.

Unfortunately, there isn't a one-size-fits-all treatment for this disease, and some people have to try a lot of things before finding what works for them. I'm one of those - I tried three different combinations of treatments, and the one I'm on now isn't *perfect*, but it's the one that works best so far. Hopefully she finds something that works for her soon!
