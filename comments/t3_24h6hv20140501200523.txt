Is there no OSHA rule that would require her to be working in pairs?

I work in the same industry up in Canada, and whether it's a company policy or mandated policy I don't know, but all our techs go out in teams. Considering all the opportunities for things to go wrong, it makes sense to me that everyone should have back up.
