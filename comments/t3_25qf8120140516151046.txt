One unique side note that I have a very firm stance on: I have had many females in my life say things along the lines of 'no doesn't always mean no.' (with a wink type look) I instantly stop all flirting/sexual stuff and get very serious by telling them, yes it does, period.  Due to my situations, I am quite unique, however to see on the continuum that there are people who want their power taken away and want to feel like a victim is really rough on me, I do not consider it play at all.  If no doesn't always mean no, you better have talked about nearly everything sexual and have a very clearly defined safe word, not be a flirty stranger in a bar making advances.  [gets off soap box]
