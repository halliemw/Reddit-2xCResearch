From my understanding of it, a lot of it is determined by whether or not an officer can get enough together to get a warrant ordering a person for an interview or collection of fingerprints/reference DNA knowns.  Unfortunately if they can't just bump into someone (or track them down) and get them to voluntarily talk, their hands are tied.

From the perspective of a DNA Analyst, we ALWAYS want the officer to have talked to a person and collected reference samples beforehand.  In the event that they were unable to, we test the evidence to determine if we can even get usable results...then if so, the officer often has enough information/cause to go forward and request a warrant to proceed.  Obviously the former is far easier than the latter.
