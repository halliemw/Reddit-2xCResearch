Yes, the study measured that as well, this summary fails to mention it but the original npr story did.

 Everyone discriminated in favor of white dudes.  I know previous studies have shown the same (women and men both have the same gender specific biases in writing letters of recommendation for example).

Also why did you immediately assume they didn't measure this?  It's a mind boggling easy thing to do since obviously they would know the identity of the faculty involved.
