First off, being old and of a different generation is not an excuse. The world changes. You have to adapt to it, you can't just decide to stop developing as a person at some point and have it be ok.

Second, if he's as sexist as he sounds, having a woman tell him about how he's being inappropriate will do absolutely nothing. He will write it off because she is a woman. 

Third, as to ruining his life...why are you giving this man all your consideration, and none to the women in his classes who feel insulted and hurt and are afraid to speak up?
