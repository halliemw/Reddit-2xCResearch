I agree, unless someone leaves an unwrapped bloody tampon or pad in the trash, because that's pretty disgusting. I don't keep a bag in my bathroom trash can but I do just dump it when I take out the rest of mg trash so I don't pick it up with my bare hands or anything. I would be pretty pissed if someone didn't wrap up their sanitary products though, because I have toilet paper, lots of it actually, and all in plain view. There's no excuse for that. But just throwing them away wrapped up like a normal person? Yeah, sure, no problem.
