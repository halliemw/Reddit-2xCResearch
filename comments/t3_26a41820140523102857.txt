TwoX only became default recently. It was and should still be a place for women of all types to talk about their problems, dreams, and fears to a community of other women or supporters. If you don't like it, then you don't need to subscribe. Don't automatically assume people do this shit for karma. Most of these threads are about traumatic experiences and they deserve for them to be treated as such.
