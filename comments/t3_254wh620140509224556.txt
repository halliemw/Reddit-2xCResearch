>The mod team was (and is still) concerned about the effect that the default decision would have on the community. 

Going default negatively affected the tone on r/books, which used to be a wonderful place with about 200k subscribers. It's ruder, and crueler now, too often anti-author, and sadly not fun anymore. That's not for a lack of trying on the part of regular, high-impact contributors and the mods. Accordingly, I can't see default working for this sub. I was very surprised to see the change. I would love to be wrong.
