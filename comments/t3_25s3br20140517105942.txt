This guy sounds like me, except I'm not a doctor, so trust me on this: if he's really that dorky he will not ask you. Even he's attracted to you he'll not know how to make that first move. Subtle hints are not going to work either. He'll be oblivious, or recognise them hours later after reliving the moment a few times, making him feel awkward and/or stupid. 

One way might be to write your phone number on his receipt, add 'call me!' and wait. But even that might not work, or creep him out. In my opinion the best option is to go to the restaurant when you're not working, and ask him if you can join him for some coffee, and take it slow from there. But take the initiative.
