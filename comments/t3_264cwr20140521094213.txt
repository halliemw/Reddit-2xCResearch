A little joking is okay. This sounds way too much - whether he's kidding or not it has to stop. Similarly the male-female thing is okay in tiny amounts, especially if made clear it's a joke, but if it's enough that you notice it as a hallmark of your relationship, it's too much :(

Have you told him you're not happy with this stuff?
