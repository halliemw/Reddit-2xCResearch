I personally find cats (and other cuddly pets) WAY easier to keep alive than plants or fish! I swear I get a plant and it's dead in a week, but thankfully my cats usually last a few weeks longer. ;) (I'm kidding, the youngest I've had a cat die is 16 years old after having a rough early life before we found him.)

Freya is an adorable name for an adorable cat!
