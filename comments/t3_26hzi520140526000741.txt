Taser and a loud whistle or alarm too, or anything that makes a lot of noise.  Criminals don't want attention drawn to themselves and if the individual isn't too close to you can't use the taser.  This isn't overreacting at all.  I also suggest some self defense classes and that you keep your cell phone always fully charged.
