Totally do, though it took me a while to stop looking for partners who were deeply damaged because I saw myself as damaged. In fact, I just had an abortion with my current absolutely wonderful and supportive partner. It was particularly sad for us because he and I plan on having kids at some point, but it was still the right decision as neither of us are in a position where we can give a child the attention and financial support it deserves. Sad, but not traumatic and not overly painful and definitely the right decision.
