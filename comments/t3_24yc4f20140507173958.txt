I've seen a lot of people who are like...pro-choice but not okay with a lady being fine with her abortion. Like pro-choice as long as the abortion ultimately costs you a ton of mental anguish and is the hardest decision you've ever had to make in your entire life. Otherwise you're history's greatest monster.
