The only thing that is dramatic is the situation that OP went through, not my response highlighting the obvious potential outcomes of not defending yourself when someone physically assaults you.  He was already restraining her wrists, bruising them, and screaming in her face.  Why on Earth would you think that was all he was going to do and her smacking him is the thing that caused all of this? And the fact that you think I have "anti-man" views just by virtue of existing in this sub clearly indicates (if your scummy attitude and tone didn't) that you don't give a fuck about this situation other than to troll this subreddit.
