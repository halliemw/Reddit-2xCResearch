I can't tell if you think OP or /u/Ambrosia or me is the example of how the RW is killing this sub, but I don't think any of us are. While I absolutely don't agree with /u/Ambrosia on healthcare, that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be welcome here or that they're ruining anything. They're contributing to the conversation, and while their views on this are elitist and bigoted, they aren't misogynistic.
