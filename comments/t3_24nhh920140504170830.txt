Nit picking trying to disregard my argument because you can't actual prove it wrong. How very typical. 

I was giving the sentence which included men which you seemed to conveniently miss. Oh and what is this "society" that seeks to give men all this power? Are they the same people who are supposedly going to take away all the guns?

Yes I very much disagree with patriarchy in the western world and find it very offensive. Men are put in power and given privilege by these mysterious people in charge and they just oppress every woman. So nothing ever the fault of women. No we're just weak and don't have any control over our actions. 

Again who are these mysterious people who somehow control society and put men in charge?
