I found what has to be the longest list of behavioral questions there is: https://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/pharmd/prod/groups/cop/@pub/@cop/@pharmd/documents/asset/completelistofbehavioral.pdf. They usually start with, "Tell me about a time when you...." My struggle is that it's sometimes hard to sort through about 10 years of experience from my last job to come up with a good answer. Even if I practiced the question before-hand, I tend to freeze up when the questions are asked.
