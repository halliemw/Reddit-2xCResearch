Yes.

My first job was immediately a mistake because the lady for whom I agreed to work revealed herself to be extremely unorganized, unprofessional, and rude. But I needed money so whatever.


Don't worry about disappointing your new boss. You didn't start working for her in order to make a BFFL, nor are you working to appease anyone else. You need a job, this is the one you found, you have a degree so it would be foolish to stay with her forever. It's really that cut and dry. If you try to drag emotions into it you will be manipulated into a position which is not going to benefit you.

**edit** And really...she's an employer. She's paying you the least amount possible in order to benefit herself and her business. Don't feel like you need to jeopardize your success (or even feel guilty about leaving at all) for someone who is literally taking as much from you while giving you the least amount (ethically, legally) in return.
