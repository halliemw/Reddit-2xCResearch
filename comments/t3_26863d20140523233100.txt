If you'll pardon my saying, I can't help but chuckle. Mrs. shArkh & I hold a pretty heavy dislike for our completely disparate, related families- but we're practically couplezilla & have been happily together for a long time now.

The largest get-together with mine has been five. All but my parents are gone now; she wants to murder my father- she hates half of my family. I understand, I love him but he is a bit of a prick. HERS is some monstrous clan of blabbermouths (30+ last count) half of which are in a constant state of baby-rabies, religious nutjobbery, or just... really derpy. I hate half of her family. She understands that I'm just not zen enough for dealing with large crowds of *hnnng*-blood-vessel-pop-

The key? We live a long way from either of them. 6hrs by car, used to be 12 :D When you move in together, make sure it's more than just a brief car jaunt away... stay calm, deep breaths, and keep telling yourself *"It's only for a little longer, just a bit longer..."* and then you can quite cheerfully ignore them. The wife's flown out to say hi a couple times whilst I've stayed home; we've both had our little injections of family brashness, and peace & quiet. Works pretty well!
