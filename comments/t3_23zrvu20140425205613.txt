When I'm sad, I watch videos of Ellen giving money/scholarships/houses/vacations/presents to really wonderful people. I love hearing their stories, and in reminded of how many wonderful people are out there. Whether they've done something heroic, charitable, talented, or all of the above, it's nice to see that people can be good, too.  :)
