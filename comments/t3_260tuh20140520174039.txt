Crushes to me are an idealization of the person, combined with some attraction. I used to get crushes a lot as a kid, often forced myself to have crushes in order to get over rejection from someone I loved (NOT a crush).

Now that I'm older and men have been very weird, I don't get crushes much anymore because I simply don't idealize people anymore and I don't usually feel physical attraction anyway.

Occasionally I'll get platonic, intellectual crushes now where I'm just happy to be around the person and see their brain in action.

No idea how normal it is to not really crush on people though.
