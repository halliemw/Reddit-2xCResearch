I second that there is no *should*; people are free to handle this situation as they want. 

However, I personally think it's strange and would make me uncomfortable that my boyfriend never introduced me to his best friend, and even more strange if that secret best friend were a girl.

I also think it's strange he's never integrated you with his other friends. Usually in situations like this---after two years---there is a reason for the hesitancy.
