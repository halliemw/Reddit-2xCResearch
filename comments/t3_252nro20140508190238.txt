Something about this article didn't quite sit right with me, I guess as if the no-make up thing is like a deliberate statement rather than just the default.

>Emmanuelle Alt of French Vogue also uses the no-makeup look.

"Uses"? I know that was just a photo caption but I found that to be a very strange choice of words, implying that not wearing make up has  has underlying an intent and purpose. It's how we are born, why should the expectation be that women will wear make up?
