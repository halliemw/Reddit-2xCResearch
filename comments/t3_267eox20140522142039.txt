My experience has been different than this article. From my experience coding is 100% percent based on what you can do and how much you cost. I've been working in IT and been coding since the 80's. I've interviewed a lot of people for jobs and been in on interviews that others were conducting. I have yet to see gender, or race, come in to it. Even education is irrelevant, at least to the small startups that I usually find myself in. Its all about what you can do and if you can show your ability you will get the job.
