Im a twenty something who travel often alone, besides being aware of your surroundings...and I agree with others, make sure you're in regular communication with someone. Just so they know when things are amiss.

Airbnb is my preferred method, I've had very safe experiences. Hey, and if you are ever near Philadelphia - from one 2X to another, I would be more than happy to extend a safe couch :)
