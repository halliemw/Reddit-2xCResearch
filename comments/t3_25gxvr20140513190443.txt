I don't really like that term to be honest. At least not as it's commonly used. When people think of strong female characters they often think of the tough chick that kicks ass and gets what she wants. 

Which is okay. It just shouldn't be the pinnacle of character design.

For me a strong character is a character with depth and background. They don't have to be traditionally strong. They can be weak, cowardly, stupid, vile, horrible, beautiful, smart, strong or anything else or any combination. They need substance. They need throughts of their own. They need a life and goals and fears and strengths and weaknesses.

They need agency. It doesn't have to be some heroic goal, it doesn't have to be something flashy and awesome, but there has to be something. Even if it's just holding onto the status quo in the face of adversity or staying alive in a dangerous situation.
