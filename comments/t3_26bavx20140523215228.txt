Fault? No. Is there responsibility? Yes.

Look at it this way. Everyone thought "x" was a great guy. Most likely he thinks the same thing about himself. Because nobody speaks out and rejects his behavior and him. His actions are "normal" to him and unknown to others. Nobody has set boundaries that he was willing to abide by. Because of the lack of boundaries he does not know how to properly interact with the opposite sex. And that is a problem for a lot of men, across the entire world.
