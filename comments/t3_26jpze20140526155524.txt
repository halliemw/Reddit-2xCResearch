Have you had a mammogram?

Go the the doctor. The odds of it being cancer are very low, but peace of mind is worth it. Besides maybe the particular birth control isn't right for you. 

Don't let the doc dismiss your concerns. Demand that something be done to clarify what is happening in your breast.
