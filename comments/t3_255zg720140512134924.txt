Hahahahaha, that condom idea is hilarious & disturbing...like much of our humor.

When I was told I was terminal, my wife and I tried to figure out a way to deal with it.  In the end, we decided on having the Grim Reaper come visit me in chemo.  

My friend dressed up as the Grim Reaper, came walking into chemo and said "I have an appointment with Canceryguy?"  Then he tried a few times to pronounce my name (it's a little strange), then said "Screw it...Duck, duck, duck...GOOSE!" and pointed at me.  

I jumped up, said "Oh shit!" grabbed my IV pole and started running. He then chased me out of chemo.  It was awesome.
