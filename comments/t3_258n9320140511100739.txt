I just got one from ASOS for $26! It has underwire and is bra sized. I always hated bikini tops bc as a 32F even the thicker strapped ones looked bad, but this one is super flattering and comfy. I haven't actually gotten it wet yet, but I'm really pleased so far. Plus the top/bottom are sold separately so I can just wear whatever bottoms I want.
