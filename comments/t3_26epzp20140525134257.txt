What you don't seem to be getting is that talk of the "Patriarchy" isn't about some big conspiracy that people are actually aware they are perpetrating. It's a way to describe they way society currently socializes people based on their gender and how in this, men have a privileged place in society. This doesn't mean that most feminists are saying "men are bad guy rapists". What it is saying is that the balance of power is shifted so that women's standing in their social groups and abilities to participate in things like careers hinge on their ability to be attractive to men first, and their merits second. 

I know many men whom I work with that are unattractive but do not have their opinions dismissed because of it.
