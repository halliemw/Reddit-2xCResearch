I have been approaching menopause for more than a decade.  I first felt the change coming on at age 45.  I will be 60 this year.  That is a long, slow transition!  BUT I did it totally naturally.  I took/take NO drugs or hormones.  For the last 5 years I had irregular periods, and they got shorter and lighter, AND more irregular.  This year is the first year that I had NO period, no spotting, no NOTHING.  I am finally past it, my dears!  :)  AMA.  :)
