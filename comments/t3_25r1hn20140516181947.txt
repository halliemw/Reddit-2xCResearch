Ok, just to clarify here, in no way are "plus ones" just a given part of "polite society".  There are all kinds of etiquettes rules about wedding guests, but I'd say for the most part,  they agree that significant others who are married, living together, or engaged should be invited together.  After that, things get fuzzy.

There is absolutely no way I would spend $100/head for all of my friends to bring their weekly fling/random friend along to a very intimate moment in my life.
