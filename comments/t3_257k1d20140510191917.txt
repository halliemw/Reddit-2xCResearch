Sorry, I just need to throw in my two cents here. I have such a love/hate relationship with the implanon. I was taking an oral contraceptive for a short time and wound up with some undesirable side effects. I went to my doctor to request an IUD instead, but she suggested I try implanon instead. It releases a lower dose of hormones than the pill and it's more effective. At first, I absolutely loved it. It was fantastic for the first eight to nine months. It's been all downhill since then. I have surprise periods (once every two or three months and completely unpredictable) which last around two weeks, and the flow is absurdly high. 

I asked my doctor to remove it, but she suggested I wait a little while to see if the issue resolved itself (apparently that happens sometimes). Six months have gone by with no improvement, and I still dread each period. I'm so desperate that I'm planning on going back to my doctor and asking her to remove the implanon and just get my tubes tied. I'm going to suck it up until I can find a better alternative or get my tubes tied. Because as much as it absolutely sucks to bleed like a sacrificial pig for weeks on end, it still beats getting pregnant. 

Long story short, the implanon is probably great for women who don't have problems with hormonal birth control. But for those of us who do have problems, the "low dose" is probably not low enough. I'm not saying don't use it (I'd still chose the implanon over the pill); just know there's a chance you'll encounter problems (as with all contraceptives, of course).
