I'm starting a new job on Monday! My husband and I moved 6,000 miles away for his job, and after 3 months I finally found one too!  
Not gonna lie, the three months at home has been awesome bc I worked remotely for my old company and we were able to get a [puppy](http://i.imgur.com/YJN8M04.jpg) ! He's adorable, and I love him to bits. Gonna be a little sad when I have to leave him at home on Monday.
