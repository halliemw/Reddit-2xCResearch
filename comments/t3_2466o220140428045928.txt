Looking back I wish I did call them out on it. I knew my dad was right there but I still didn't feel quite safe. My dad has never stood up for me before and wouldn't have done it then and would have probably dragged me out of there blaming me for it. It was disgusting but if anything happens again like that I will say something next time. Thank you for the advice!
