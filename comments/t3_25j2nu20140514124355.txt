[This blog](http://adayinthelifeofmystyle.blogspot.com/2013/08/mica-freebismuth-free-makeup.html) has a great list of mica-free makeup. Even before this news came to light, there were already a lot of people who were avoiding mica in makeup due to skin irritation or allergies.

One other thing to keep in mind, though: if you're really concerned about the plight of child laborers, then just avoiding this ingredient isn't the only thing to worry about. It's not like children working in sweatshops are in a vastly better or safer working situation. If you dislike the idea of supporting child labor in your makeup purchases, buy makeup manufactured in places like the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan.
