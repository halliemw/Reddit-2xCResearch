Yeah, I'm in agreement with you there. I don't understand why so many people think "no" can mean "yes." That's not true at all; by definition, no means to reject or express disagreement with something. It's a very strong word, but so many use it lightly that it's become less meaningful. There are people out there who playfully say "no, stop!" while being tickled by a friend, for example, and instances like that lead to a disregard for the word.

This is something entirely different. When someone says "no" to sex, *they mean no*.
