Worrying about being pregnant can cause you to attribute other normal symptoms as "pregnancy" symptoms.  If you are pregnant enough to have genuine pregnancy symptoms, you're pregnant enough to have a positive pregnancy test (at least, one of the more sensitive types of tests).

My advice would be to A) buy a pack of cheap pregnancy tests online (Amazon has really cheap ones, eligible for free or Prime shipping!) and test once a day with first-morning-urine until you get a period - the negative tests will give you some peace of mind, hopefully; B) go to your doctor about the frequent urination/weird pee - those are classic UTI symptoms, and UTIs can escalate to more serious infections really quickly.  Your doctor can also run a blood pregnancy test if you ask, as those will often turn up positive before you can get a positive home test.
