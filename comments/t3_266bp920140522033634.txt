I think every young woman gets hit on regardless of their career. I work as an RN and I have been hit on by coworkers,  patients and patient family members. I do wear a ring but at times I don't cause I'm constantly washing my hands but ring on or not some guys don't care. I think getting hit on by coworkers is the worst. My last job & current job I have been hit on by coworkers even after the fact that I made it clear I was in a relationship. I do my best to avoid causal conversations and keep it strictly work related.
