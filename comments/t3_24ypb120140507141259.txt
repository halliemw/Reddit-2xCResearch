One way I saved a little money was by not mentioning that I was shopping for a wedding. Simple white dress suddenly shoots up $200 or more in price when you add "wedding" to the name. A vased bouquet of flowers is a helluva lot cheaper than a "bridal bouquet", and you can wrap the stems yourself. 

Talk to you fiance about the rings. You two are the ones whose opinions matter; you're the ones who'll be wearing them for the rest of your lives. Who cares what anyone else thinks?

What has significance to the two of you? Did you meet him while he was catching frogs at a pond and he dropped one in your lap? Put frog figurines around as decoration. Did you bond over your shared love of Pixar movies? Write his name on the bottom of your shoe (and get pictures of it). 

That's really the only thing I would recommend spending the most money on: photography. The experience will eventually fade, and a quality photographer can capture the most potent moments forever.
