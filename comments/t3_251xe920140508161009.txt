"There are plenty of fish in the sea" is a terribly demeaning phrase. People in relationships (generally) want things to work out so they can remain together, and if the relationship does end they don't want to be reminded of their loss with the "trade-off" that there are more people out there. 

OP wants to be with her husband and wants to see it work. Implying divorce is not helpful.
