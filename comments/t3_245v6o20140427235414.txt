I have been playing first period shooters since I was 8. I started with Counter Strike and now I am playing COD. I have always had to deal with the comments and negativity. I have learned to either ignore it, not talk, or play with my boyfriend and his friends on our competitive team. Sometimes, if they are mean comments, I am mean back. I try to remain neutral, but I have also developed some pretty good come backs to most of what people say to me.  It's hard sometimes. I just feel like sometimes guys feel emasculated when we beat them :P.
