I do that too and it's so compulsive if I try to stop I do it in my sleep. My husband joked about putting mittens on me when I sleep, but it sucks. 

One thing I have found that helped me do it less is knitting/crocheting. I work on something creative and productive, and somehow it gets the fidgets out of my fingers. Even if it's just a simple washcloth I feel better!
