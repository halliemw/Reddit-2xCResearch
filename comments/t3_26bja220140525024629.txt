I am very much the way you described yourself, too, aside from the chubbiness (but I did not believe I was pretty, either). I realised that I was overly comfortable where I was at 21 - not going out/travelling/exploring, so I decided to apply for a job out in the middle of the desert. It was the best thing I ever did - many people came to work out here without knowing anyone, so we were all very accepting and welcoming of new-comers. One year later, I met my boyfriend when he started working at the same place I did. We have been together for 1.5 years now.
