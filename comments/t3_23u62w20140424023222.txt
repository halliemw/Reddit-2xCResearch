I am so, so sorry you went through that!! It seems now that you have projected one bad experience onto hundreds of thousands of people. Therapists are not inherently bad people, which I'm sure you know. It sounds like you would really benefit from mental health treatment but the treatment is frightening enough. That person should be imprisoned for her lies, but she is *not* representative of therapists as a whole. Why does one bad person mean all people who are in the same job are bad? 

The only way for you to truly be healthy is to start working through your past and those fears. Physically, you are probably just fine. It's understandable why your brain has put up these walls and generalizations, and common in cases of childhood abuse (that's the only way it can come up with to protect itself). There are people that specialize in this area of abuse. It's hard to imagine how you could ever be comfortable giving that consent to a doctor unless you can learn to disassociate the bad doctor you saw as a child from all doctors.
