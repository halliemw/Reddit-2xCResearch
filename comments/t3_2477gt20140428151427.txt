getting the cat was his idea, not mine. It was a birthday surprise gift, which I addressed by telling him that though I appreciate the gesture, an animal really should not be a "surprise gift" but a discussion we should have before getting one. It wasn't a shelter cat either. It was a purebred that costs a few hundred dollars. 


He's not offering me a "solution". It may not come across from my post but it was a "deal with my snoring or you can get rid of this precious cat that we both love and spent tons of money on." Putting aside the fact that's it really wasn't much of a rational discussion, it frustrates me because we are only at this point because he didn't think twice before getting a pet that he's allergic to, then threatens me with the exact issue I was worried about - an animal is not something you get and pass around for whatever reason, it too needs a stable environment. 


Thank you for your comment but I'm not really looking for advice. I guess I just need to vent? I'm sad and frustrated but I know what needs to be done.
