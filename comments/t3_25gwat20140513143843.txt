It doesn't matter if she didn't say "no" initially. He penetrated her while she was still asleep (and heavily intoxicated), and when she did say no, not only did he not stop, he did it harder--to the point where she screamed in pain. 

OP, he raped you. I hope you find the support you need. And if you feel up to it, you are probably still in the window of time where a rape kit would be feasible.
