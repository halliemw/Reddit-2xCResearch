I dunno about "many." [The first print-ad to show a red-dot instead of blue euphemistic liquid ran in 2011](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/always-runs-first-feminin_n_891546.html). It made international headlines. [Bodyform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpy75q2DDow) also made headlines when this one came out, but it doesn't actually *show* anything. 

I mean.. it seems like whenever an ad runs without being the typical sappy crap it makes headlines (remember [Camp Gyno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XnzfRqkRxU) ?) - and that's just in western media. In plenty of the world, feminine hygiene as a whole is a complete taboo still, let alone in frank discussion. 

I'd like to see the many, is what I'm saying.
