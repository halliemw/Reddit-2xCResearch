There are other way more helpful posts in this thread, but here's my anecdote about tell women::

My mom is six feet tall, with naturally crimped, curly, dirty blond hair that looks wild (i got her hair, but curlier and a few shades darker). She wears size eleven shoes (her feet are long and flat, like skis). I don't know what her parents did for her self-confidence growing up, but, as her daughter, I always pictured her as this awesome, strong, powerful Amazon woman. She used her height to intimidate people who were trying to mistreat her (or my sister and I). When she walks into a room people can't not notice - she is so clearly *present*. She still had body-image issues - she is not very curvy, and laments a lack of booty - but she generally seemed to feel attractive and confident. When I was a kid, I wanted nothing so bad as to be tall like my mom.

One thing:: tall women tend to try to shrink from their tallness. A common tendency is to roll one's shoulders in, and kind of hunch around, like you're trying to hold a basketball with your stomach and chest. I'm not sure how to correct that behavior in a positive way (it's a coping mechanism, so people get defensive of it), but it's not super great for your back and shoulders.
