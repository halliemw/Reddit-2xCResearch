I was in a situation where I couldn't have sex for about four months and it really put a strain on my relationship, so I understand where you are coming from. It's hard to get back into the groove of things, but once you do it's worth it. 

It sounds like you two need to have an honest conversation about where your libidos are at. He sounds frustrated and you sound resentful . Some one suggested a night of romance and I second that. Don't make sex (or at least PIV) a necessity. Tell him you want to ease back into it so you don't feel pressure or get performance anxiety. 

Try some high school stuff, seriously. Like long make out sessions, mutual masturbation and all that jazz. All naked cuddling might be a good idea. Those are some suggestions to kinda get back into it.
