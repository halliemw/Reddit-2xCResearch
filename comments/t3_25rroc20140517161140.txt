It comes down to each individual woman- it shouldn't be allowed to impress others' beliefs onto another person. 

I wouldn't get an abortion myself, but I have assisted a friend through her's. I would never, ever try to tell my friend that the sack of cells that is completely dependent on her, that she would have to sacrifice her body and time for, is more important than her. To me, that's simply not true. 

I would not be comfortable with someone telling me that I, against my will, was going to be hooked up to someone else for 9+ months in a risky way for *me*, in order to keep them alive. I think people forget how hard pregnancy is; physically, mentally, emotionally. I have actually been pregnant, and I had a miscarriage. My boyfriend wants 4 children and I can't say that I actually want any (that one was an accident). He tries to tell me it's not going to be that bad, that he'll be there to help me like he was before. That was all well and good but that pregnancy took such a toll on me that I still have health problems because of it. It was 4 years ago that that happened. He makes it seem so easy, it's really not. It's the most physically demanding and grueling thing I've ever done, and I'm no wimp. I would never be okay with forcing someone to accept that life.
