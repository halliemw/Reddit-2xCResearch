I'm the only girl I know who doesn't like cuddling, and even among guys my comrades are few. My friends all have cuddle fests while I sit happily in my corner (happily, as my preferences are respected).


When it comes to dogs, though? I turn into a cuddle beast. I am also Grand Dispenser of Belleh Rubs.
