It sounds like your husband unilaterally decides who does what and when it happens. That's not fair. You need to communicate with one another. Explain to him that you will clean on your own time and that right after work is not the time you choose. **Do NOT let him tell you what to do**. You must both agree and be okay with your resolution.

Write down everything that needs to be done and discuss when it's going to be completed and who is doing what. That way you both understand one another, you aren't nervous about being ambushed and he isn't nervous about when you'll clean.
