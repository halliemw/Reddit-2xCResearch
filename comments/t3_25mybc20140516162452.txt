Yes. A recent study in Colorado found that Mirena was inserted successfully in nullips about 96% of cases. This was actually slightly higher than among multips which was closer to 95%. It is definitely not the right option for everyone, especially if the provider is uncomfortable with the insertion procedure. Skyla is also an interesting option being that it is smaller and more flexible so theoretically easier to insert. I have not used one yet.
