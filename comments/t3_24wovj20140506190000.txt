Not every country is as feminist as the United States. To me, warning women about cultural differences that could result in a higher chance of rape is no different than warning them about overly aggressive pickpockets in certain countries.

I guess maybe asking her to include something about how other cultures may not respect women and their bodies as much as your current country does might soften the blow?
