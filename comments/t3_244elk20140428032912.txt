I would think people who were "messed up" by having a lot of casual sex were those that did it for the wrong reasons because of low self esteem or some other emotional issue. As in they didn't really *want* to have casual sex, they just did it because they thought it was what they were "supposed" to do or for approval. I would hazard to guess they already had some emotional issues to begin with, and having sex when they weren't really comfortable with it just worsened them. That and/or the stigma attached to casual sex. Perhaps if that stigma didn't exist it wouldn't mess with them. Obviously I'm just speculating here, I'm no psychologist. Personally I had a good amount of casual sex in between my committed relationships and the only problems I've had are rolling my eyes at people who judged me for it. Ultimately I much, much prefer sex in a committed monogamous relationship, but if I'm unattached (god forbid, I'm married :D) it can be exciting to have a good ol' fashion roll in the sheets with a casual hookup/fuck buddy. Always using protection, of course. Never had an STI aside from HPV, and I got that from a dude who raped me :(

No matter what the studies end up saying, it is a very good idea to teach your kids as you said. Being honest with and educating yourself is always a smart thing to do.
