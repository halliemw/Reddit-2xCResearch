He's cheated on you 3 times in 6 years? It's not going to stop, clearly. You deserve **so much** better than that. You clearly don't feel like you do, but you do. No one deserves that kind of garbage. There *are* people out there who will be honest and loyal and whose word you don't need to question. You deserve *that*.
