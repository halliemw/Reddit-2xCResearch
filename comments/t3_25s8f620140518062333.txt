I don't like it either, doesn't mean it's right to tweet such awful things about it. Part of me thinks that's the risk you take with this kind of industry but she's not supposed to be a model, she's a comedian. She shouldn't be held to the same standards because she's not there to look pretty, she's there to celebrate her work.
