Congratulations on your new (better) job!
    
I would take a list with you of all the things that she said to you. Give her and the HR person each a copy. Explain what it is. Say that you were taken aback that she felt it appropriate in the first place to put you in that scenario. The list shows that this was not constructive criticism. It was just mean.
    
Then say that, while you were never told these things about your personality before, you made a good faith effort to check their accuracy and no one you asked thought that these were accurate descriptors. 
    
After doing these things, you concluded that Bully Boss was trying to tear you down instead of build you up. You decided that you did not want to work in such an environment.
    
Do all of this in a very formal, professional matter. Keep as steady as you can. If someone tries to interrupt you, raise your hand and say "let me finish." Do not ramble. Be short and direct. And stay confident. Do not allow them to try to undermine your perception or decision.
    
Good luck!
