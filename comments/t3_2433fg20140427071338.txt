Music store. What my SO knows about music can be summed up in the space of thirty seconds. I've been playing most of my life. When we moved here, we went into the music store so I could buy guitar strings (and scope them out a little). What I wanted was a little specific but it isn't a small store. Not only did they not carry it, the guy immediately decided they didn't exist and deferred to my husband. My quick-witted SO whipped out his phone and Googled what I had been looking for to shut the guy up. I haven't gone back in there since.
