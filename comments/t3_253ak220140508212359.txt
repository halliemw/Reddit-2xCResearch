Haha! I'm glad that you liked my comment:) I'm really sorry that you're dealing with all of this. I hate street harassment, no matter how benevolent it may appear, and I really hate the way people tend to minimize it, or shrug it off if I try to complain. Im sorry, but I don't have any advice for you. I tried everything, and the only think that I ever found that worked was moving to the Pacific Northwest. I fucking love it here, people are really polite.
