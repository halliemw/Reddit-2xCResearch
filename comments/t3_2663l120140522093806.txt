"Banning" any kind of material is a very a slippery slope. I've tried to talk to people about establishing guidelines for what is and what is not appropriate to bring to meetings, as well as how artwork should be displayed. I actually think that the "hold up your artwork and talk about it" format isn't a very good one, as it doesn't give anyone a choice as to whether or not to look at the artwork. I know that, if I'd been given a choice, I wouldn't have looked at D's artwork. I know that A felt the same way, like she'd been forced to look at something that made her uncomfortable.
Bringing in previously published material that does depict a rape scene (such as "Watchmen", "Locke and Key", "Sandman", etc) is different, but only because of the format it's being presented it. If someone brings in their own original artwork, they're usually holding up large individual pages. If someone brings in a copy of "Watchmen," then the book is sitting on the table and is closed. A person has the option of picking it up and flipping through it. 
I also think that the difference between something like "Watchmen" and D's work is the context. In "Watchmen," the attempted rape scene is crucial to the plot; if you were to remove it, the story wouldn't make any sense. D's work was just a rape scene; if you were to remove it, then there wouldn't be anything. It was gratuitous.
