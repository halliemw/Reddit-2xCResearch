I have been reading and contributing to TwoX for years now. Only a couple times did I have to specify my gender (or else the comment wouldn't have made any sort of sense). That's the mistake I see these chaps making, like the title of this thread and the first sentence.

So, bros, if you put "as a man" or something of the sort in your comment, try taking that out and rereading it to yourself. You'll find that many times it's not needed.

NOT that your contribution should automatically be downvoted if you do identify yourself (as long as the content is respectful and relevant), but I promise it will just be easier.

I've had an awesome relationship with this sub, also /r/TrollXChromosomes. They've really opened my eyes to a lot of things and expanded my understanding of not just women but humanity as a whole.
