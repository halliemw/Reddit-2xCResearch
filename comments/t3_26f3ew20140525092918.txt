I would like to second this OP, if you're comfortable with it. I used to have some trouble talking to people, mostly due to the intimidation of being a stranger. I began hosting in a restaurant, and after a year or so of that I've been much more confident talking to anyone. Working somewhere where you talk to people will help confidence, although it's true that this will more so give you practice with small-talk rather than the deep conversations you're hoping for. Joining a club would probably help you find people with common interests, which will make conversation beyond ice-breakers easier.
