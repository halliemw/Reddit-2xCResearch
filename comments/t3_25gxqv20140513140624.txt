I stayed by myself at an Airbnb place in Portugal that was run by a guy (the place belonged to his parents, but they didn't live there). There was another girl staying there, a longer-term renter. My room had an inside lock. It was fine. I would have been reluctant to stay if the place hadn't already gotten good ratings on the site, but the ratings were good and the place measured up. Don't have any experience with Airbnb in Manhattan, sorry.
