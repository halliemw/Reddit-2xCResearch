I've never understood the big deal about this issue, personally.  Having done it, in most cases nobody even notices.  Personally I think a lot of folks have trouble with the idea that we're just animals, doing animal things like lactating.  The idea of any bodily fluid just freaks some people out, and the idea of a boob that's not in a victoria's secret ad, doing *something* (even if they can't see it due to judicious placement of baby head and/or blanket) just freaks them out.  That's their problem, not mine, and not nursing mothers'.
