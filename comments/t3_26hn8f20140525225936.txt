So... yeah, no. A dude can *feel* inferior about his sex, say, when people assume he's a child molester for no other reason than him being male and spending time with children, *even if* he otherwise has more social power and privilege than a woman does. If he doesn't notice the privilege (which is totally how privilege *works*), he's just left feeling the inferiority and not the awesomeness. Look at all those MRA dudes, who think that men are an oppressed second class to feminists or whatever.

Meanwhile, what if a woman never feels inferior because of her sex or gender, because she's never noticed sexism? It happens on this very subreddit. The sexism still happens to her, she just never sees it. Is she not a woman, then? I, myself, don't feel *inferior* because of my sex or gender, even if other people think I am. I think those people are asshats. I think being a woman is pretty rad. 

This definition is definitely not great.
