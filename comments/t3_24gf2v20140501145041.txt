I too had feelings like this in my second pregnancy. I had a 2 yo and the pg was wanted. But the moment I found out I felt shocked, anxious and just generally panicked. I should add my first pg was straight forward as was my delivery. But for the whole of my pregnancy I really struggled.  I too felt it would be easier if I miscarried. Afterwards I realised I had been depressed but at the time I didn't see it, I just felt shattered, anxious and tearful. I worried I wouldn't love the new baby. 

Anyway here's the positive part, as soon as I saw my baby boy, all those feelings fell away. I did feel that rush of love and I felt 'normal' again, like me again. 

Talk to someone, get some help. You are not alone in these feelings. I hope you are feeling better soon.
