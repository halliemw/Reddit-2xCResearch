Same here. I talk to strangers easily and my husband,  not as much. Last weekend we went out looking at phones. I was thinking of upgrading and we were getting a phone for my son. Dude at Best Buy was awesome- explained everything I wanted to know and answered all my questions. I can't think of a specific time where someone was pretty much ignoring me in favor of my husband unless he was the one initiating the exchange. 

I think when things like OP is talking about does happen, a lot of it has to do with fear or uncertainty. It reminds me of once when one of those Kirby salesmen came to my house. He seemed kind of uneasy and asked if my husband would be home soon. I mean, I'd made an appointment for him to come and thought it was odd. Eventually he explained that he'd had a couple husbands come home while he was in the middle of a demo, which includes vacuuming the mattress, and get quite upset with him for being there with their wives. When guys see a guy with a girl, they think y hat talking to the man won't incur his wrath. Conversely,  a lot of women will talk to the woman in the couple instead of the man for the same reason.

Of course, there are men and women who would rather do business with people of their own gender because they think that the other one is stupid/can't understand what they mean/just don't like them/etc. But that is nowhere near the case on every occasion where this happens.
