But I come here for support. I really shouldn't *have* to report them. They shouldn't be there. I don't feel like it's a safe community for me anymore. I don't want to risk seeing a comment that disagrees with me when I'm looking for and really need support. I don't want to post something for IFF and risk being criticized for what I'm wearing or just doing it for attention. That's not pandering to them, that's me not wanting to deal with bullshit.
