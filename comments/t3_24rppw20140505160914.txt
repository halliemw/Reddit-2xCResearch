In the 90's I went to Daddy Daughter dances with my father. It was through the town Rec center. I always thought it was just practice for going to dances or weddings in the future, which I'm sure it was.

I remember being so excited to put on a dress and have my hair done. I knew all my other girlfriends from school would be there with their dads too. They were always really fun. The Polaroid pictures we came back with were *wildly* different than these and had a much more whimsical mood to them. My dad still has one from our first Daddy Daughter dance on his desk at work.
