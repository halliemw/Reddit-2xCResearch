Okay, first off, breathe. 

Secondly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Some women just don't seem to click with other women. Sometimes that happens to me, where I tend to have more male friends than female friends. That doesn't mean I'm manly or not womanly enough or even boring, I just prefer no drama and just simply having fun.

I have had close female friends before, and I often felt like my interests and personality could only follow them so far. After a certain point, I was just not in the same zone they were in. They wanted to constantly go clubbing, drinking, shopping, and expensive restaurants. Me on the other hand, had to live more frugaly, did not enjoy the club much, and preferred to stay away from drama and gossip. I was definitely the nerdy/dorky one, and that left me feeling like I didn't really belong. 

So it may very well be that you just haven't found the right group of girls to hang out with. I now have found a few dorky ladies to hang out with and it just clicks. The friendship to evolve naturally, don't force it. Perhaps try looking into groups around your area of people that enjoy doing things you are interested in. Check out MeetUp.com. Don't limit yourself to just your work environment. 

Lastly, please love yourself. If you are criticizing your own personality all the time it will send off a negative vibe to other people. Love everything about you, even the things that are a bit hard to love. Improve on yourself, because you want to not because you feel it will make you more popular. 

I personally think that being unique is way better than being like everyone else. :) Good luck and you're welcome to massage me any time if you need.
