Read, video games, cook, play with my cat, Reddit and Pinterest, cook more.  (I'm a stereotype but still it's better than forcing relationships that aren't really there). I've done a meetup a few times which is fun but nothing substantial. When confronted with the possibility of cultivating new friendships it's easier to shy away. Still, I'd like to cultivate my comfort for being alone by seeing movies, travelling, etc by myself. there's really very few things you need a partner to do. It's just getting over that social stigma that you need to do things with another.
