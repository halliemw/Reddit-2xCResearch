No, it's bollocks. Just because it exists on average doesn't make it real. They're comparing average annual full-time salaries, not by the hour worked (so the woman working 35 hours a week and the man working 50 and earning overtime are having their final annual salaries compared, not their hourly), and a whole bunch of other factors. Now, yes, there are cases of discrimination, yes, but it's not as cut and dry as the completely bullshit 77 cent figure makes it sound.
