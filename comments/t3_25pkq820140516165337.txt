Congratulations to the original poster, and to everyone chiming in with "me too!" 

I also dropped out- decided getting married and being a mom was a better choice, after 2 years of college and having no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up.  Fast forward a few years, and the inevitable divorce, & I found myself hating that I hadn't ever finished.  I wanted more job options and to be a better role model for my two daughters. I went back, taking 1-2 classes at a time. I graduated finally, a few weeks before my 40th birthday. And then started in on my masters degree.  I'll graduate from Johns Hopkins next Friday, with my MA- just a few hours after my younger daughter graduates from high school. 

It doesn't matter how long it takes you to accomplish your goals, so long as you just keep swimming. Congratulations! 

tl:dr Great job! Have you considered grad school?
