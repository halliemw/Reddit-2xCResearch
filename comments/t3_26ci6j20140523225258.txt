Well, that day I was wearing my full face mask cause we were cutting and jackhammering concrete on the side of a high rise to expose rusted rebar. 

Once we expose it, we waterproof it and then patch over the holes in the concrete with mortar. In reality, its called waterproofing... but concrete repair sounds better and is more to the point. :p
