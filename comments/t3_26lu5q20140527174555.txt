That's so great to hear how happy you are :) my first few months at university were exactly the same. I lived off packet pasta and noodles and it really brought me down. I remember at Christmas my house mates and I made a massive roast dinner, complete with turkey, sausages, potatoes, gravy, onion sauce, broccoli, carrots and sprouts. Don't think I've ever been so happy to see a home cooked meal! We sat in silence eating it, first amount of veg most of us had had for a while and it was awesome!
