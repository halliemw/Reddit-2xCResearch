They spoke with me about my experiences, and did manual examinations of my vagina & surrounding areas. 

I went to talk to them after probably about a month of painful intercourse. The series of appointments probably took another month. Then after focussing on going slow and on the fact that there was no evidence of a problem, it eventually went away. So probably about 3 months total. The tear that might have caused this would have been immediately preceding the painful intercourse though.
