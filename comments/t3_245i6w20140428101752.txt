When I struggled with wanting to look dainty I was entirely blind to the fact that some of the women I considered "dainty" and who wore the looks I wanted were actually taller then me. I just didn't see it. Taylor Swift, like her or leave her, is a dainty looking lady at 5'11". She doesn't stoop or hide, and pictures tend to be about her, not about context. If you're not ready to see her height it's easy to miss. Famke Janssen is another tall woman with proportionately large feet who rocks it, hard. Seeing pictures of unapologetically tall women being beautiful helped me a lot.
