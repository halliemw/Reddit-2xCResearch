This is probably not the most helpful advice, and someone else in a similar situation might have a meatier answer for you. But try and document his behavior every time he comes in, preferably with dates and times. Keep notes. And keep bringing it to management. They're apathetic now, but maybe if they see that this keeps happening and how it's making all of the female staff feel uncomfortable or unsafe, they'll actually give a damn and do something. Don't let this remain a non-issue to the management.
