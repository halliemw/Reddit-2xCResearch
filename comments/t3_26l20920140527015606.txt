Whether you decided to report this as rape to the police or not (which is up to you) I would highly recommend avoiding this guy in the future, as it doesn't seem like he is someone you want to be around ever again. Certainly I'd avoid ever being around him again while either of you is drunk. 

It's pretty normal to be confused after something like this, and talking to a close friend or maybe a counselor/therapist can be a helpful way to sort through your feelings. Are you in school? If so there are probably some free resources that can help you out here.
