I had a routine Pap at my doctor.  Confirmed that both the Doctor and the Practice were In Network, and still ended up getting charged for the Pap based on the fact that the lab they sent it out to was Out of Network.  Apparently I should have asked what lab they used, checked that too, and then demanded that they send my results to another lab so that insurance would cover it.  I ended up just paying the bill and moving on, but it still irks me.
