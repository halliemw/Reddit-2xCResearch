I agree.  I do make it plain to people closer to me if I want that reinforcement (and frankly, get a little offended - although not in a way that would make me remember it longterm - if people just randomly give me weight-related comments).

I said something like this (all comments, negative and positive, are unwelcome) on another thread - but I don't think it's just about weight.  It's about a lot of things involving appearance - and moral choices.

When something is directly work related (you did this so well, there aren't any typos!  or  - could you please change, this, there are typos!!), it's different, amirite?  We have to be able to construct each other's behavior in the workplace (just today, a very young part time worker thought she was being funny regarding a behavior of mine - I truly like her, and forgave immediately, but I sure hoped she never did the same kind of commentary with anyone else, because people are going to be upset with her bossiness...)

Carrot/stick behaviors are often perceived as bossy.  Avoid!  (In real life, I guess here is different).
