I hate those machines >:(

Luckily my last job had one but it was free, so you didn't have to put money in, you just pulled the little lever and the tampon dropped down.

My current company keeps a basket of tampons and pads on the counter in the bathroom for everyone to use, I'm guessing our receptionist keeps it stocked? I feel this should be the norm and not the exception!
