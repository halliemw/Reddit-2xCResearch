I had a good week- in order of what happened-

My son brought me a flower "as pretty as you are to put in your hair."

I put on a dress because I was being lazy (dress and flats- done!) and my husband said, "Wow, you look great in that!"

And I told my daughter today that she looked really good because she had on a color that brought out her eyes and skin and she playfully yelled, "I learned it from you, okay? *I learned it from you!*" 

Been a good week!
