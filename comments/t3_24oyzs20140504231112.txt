Agreed. I think the men of our time who have to deal with the most racial and sexual stereotypes are black men. There are so many stereotypes that all black men have "swag" or 12 inch dicks. But this is a negative stereotype. Some black guys on reddit have talked about how women get disappointed because they only have an AVERAGE penis, and this makes their sex life very frustrating.
