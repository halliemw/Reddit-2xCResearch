Yes, I've had terrible luck with the cup. I simply cannot get it to stop leaking - it seems like it's sealing but it must not be because when my period is heavy I might as well wear a pad with it. I have tried three different cups - Lunette L, Sckoon L and Meluna M and have the same problem with all of them. I think I must have a narrow vagina and need a small cup, but I have a really heavy flow so the cup seems pointless when I could just use my standby super plus or ultra tampons if I'm going to have to change it every two hours anyway.
