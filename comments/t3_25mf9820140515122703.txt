20 year old female here, never got my ears pierced. My mom wanted to get it done when I was a baby but my dad wouldnt let her, and I'm grateful for that. My mom also bugged me for years about getting it done, I'm needle phobic so I refused. I really don't see how piercing your ears is different from altering any other part of your body, and I personally don't want to do so. 

By the way, magnetic earrings frikkin hurt. I tried them once, never again.
