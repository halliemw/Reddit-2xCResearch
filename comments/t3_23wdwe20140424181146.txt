Don't worry, this is totally normal! A few summers ago I dated a guy who was "perfect on paper" - he did everything right according to what I thought I wanted, was good looking and good in bed, etc. But for whatever reason, I just didn't feel a strong bond with him, and we broke it off after a few months. Don't base your decisions on what you think you should want, and don't worry that you're broken our incapable of love - you can still find a guy who actually is right for you.
