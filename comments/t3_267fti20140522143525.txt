I'm not suggesting hijabs as a blanket solution (no pun intended) to objectification. I'm saying that they're something that makes certain individual women feel comfortable.

Some men think that women who wear short skirts are asking to be raped. I don't wear short skirts because I hate having to worry about whether or not my underwear has skid marks on it and I like to get out of a car one leg at a time. Those are two separate issues.

You could attack me for wearing only long skirts and say that I am part of the problem, but I'd say that that is pretty unjust.

I've talked to women who wear burkhas who tell me how great it is to be able to roll out of bed, throw on any old outfit, put their hair in a ponytail and not have to worry that people are going to judge them based on the way that they look. I don't think that's a bad thing.
