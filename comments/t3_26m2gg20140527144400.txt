>  She'll say "What, you can say anything you want to me and I can't even talk to you?" ...Then she'll cry about how she's not even allowed to talk, and everyone tries to shut her up and how she's not allowed opinions

What if you continue with 'no, you're very welcome to talk with me, just don't say (insult), I don't like being talked that way'. Very specific, non emotional. And let her throw a tantrum, but be unemotional about it, she might stop once she realises it's ineffective. Sorry if I'm intrusive, your situation sounds difficult.
