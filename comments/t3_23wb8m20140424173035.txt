Your hair growth sounds a lot like mine--dense, grows fast, multiple hairs per follicle-- and I don't consider myself to be super hairy.  While not that many people have seen my genitals, nobody has ever commented that it's unusual down there.

I have done some laser treatments (bikini line and mustache) and it definitely reduces the amount of hair, but it generally doesn't make it go away completely and the results can be kind of patchy.  It's great if you also plan to wax/shave for upkeep, but I find it's a little too scraggly (this is 100% personal preference) to just rock on its own.
