What's shocking to me (I'm 22) is the access that kids your age are getting to the Internet and information nowadays. When I was 13 the Internet was just taking off, and I spent every hour of every day playing Neopets. Not learning about sex or being bullied on a forum that has 5 million people on it.  

A girl in my 8th grade class got pregnant, and kept her baby. She graduated high school with us, but now her daughter is 9 years old, and she's also 22. Even more disturbing was that her mother was pregnant at the same time, for the first couple years of the childrens' lives they lied and said her mother had twins because the girl we knew was ashamed that she gave birth at 13. It's a consequence that is possible, and you need to be aware of that. But at 13 its almost impossible to understand true consequences of your actions that will affect the next 70 years of your life. You just can't understand, and that's ok because that's the way the brain is built I do beg you to reconsider your actions though, as sex at 13 and self-harm are indicative of deeply rooted problems that you likely are not aware of. I hope you have someone to talk to.
