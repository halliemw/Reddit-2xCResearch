YES! Of course they can.

In your case though butt out.  It does muddy the water if there's been romantic feelings on either part.  If they need to work on their relationship, your presence will not help with her anxiety.  You probably want your friend back, but if you really care about him you'll give him the space to work things out with his love life (or make his own mistakes).
