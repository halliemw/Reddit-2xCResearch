Quite frankly I think everyone is being extremely closed-minded. And I think everyone very incorrectly thinks that all of a sudden all of twox is going to be frontpaging. On a default page with 50 subreddits, a girls post about something weird about her vagina isnt going to be any more visible than it already is. Creepy pms happen without being a default. It seems to me that everyone is concerned about racism (it already exists in this sub) and sexism (it already exists,  though in a form the girls here approve of) when in actuality very little is going to change.  The fact that twoxers arent open to conversations about sexism in which men can participate speaks volumes to me.
