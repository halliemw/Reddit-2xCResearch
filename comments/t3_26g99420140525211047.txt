I didn't say it was more serious. It should have been very clear that I was implying that she may have even felt that is was less serious, though all of our opinions will differ on how serious it really was. It really doesn't matter how serious any of us think it is, because she was the one experiencing it. It's completely inappropriate for her supervisor to have revealed himself like that, regardless of whether she was still employed by him or not. The point is that their relationship was professional and it seems very clear to all of us, him included, that she intended on keeping it that way. Waiting to drive her home after she told him she would take the bus was inappropriate, giving her a gift was inappropriate, and confronting her at the workplace was inappropriate. She was clearly uncomfortable and he violated their professional relationship. She clearly feels icky, for lack of a better word, about the whole thing, and that's not okay.
