The Gyno usually dismisses my suggestions about as to why I go through this. They just suggest more Ibuproffen, among other generic ideas. The inconsistency of the pains and the spreading area I feel it throughout is what has led me to think it's "abnormal". Also, it generally being more to my right side vs my left. Every time they push BC even though I have expressed the disinterest in taking hormones all month (also-any surgical BC or IUD grosses/freaks me out-so no go). I can manage to scrape by during the less agonizing cycles on 2-4 Ibuproffen every 4-10 hours (depending on brand and quality of the drug)...this is **days** on end. This can't be good for me?! It's been so severe at certain times that even prescription muscle relaxers or pain killers do no more good than OTC drugs. It's redic.
