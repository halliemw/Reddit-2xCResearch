just a suggestion: You say you're shy, soft spoken and quiet until you feel comfortable. Use this to your advantage. Meet your subordinates (for want of a better word) and just listen and learn from them. Ask them questions. Let them do all the talking. If anyone makes comments about your confidence again, just tell them that you're listening to what they have to say and taking in their opinion before you make any managerial decisions.
That could be your management style. I've met and learned from excellent quiet CEOs.

That could help you gauge the situations, learn how to get the best from your employees and what management styles they will respond to, and also give you tome to build your confidence with your new responsibilities.
