Sorry. I guess I've been told recently by female friends that I'm not very "defensive" of them in their time of need. That I'm "insensitive" and "indifferent" to their situations sometimes. My husband and another male frIend of mine both said that I handle certain situations "like a guy would" in my approach. I apologize for the lack of explanation, but I appreciate knowing based on the responses I'm getting that I'm not a complete ice queen to my friends.
