I'm sorry to hear that. What type of meetups do you attend? I find that common interest ones (e.g. revolve around a certain activity, board games, sports, etc.) are the easiest ones for me to find people with shared interests. 

I wish I could make internet friends... I find myself struggling to keep communication going when it's just a penpal situation. (Either I, or they lose interest eventually or conversation just starts to stall.)
