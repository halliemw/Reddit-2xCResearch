 I'm acting stronger on the outside than I feel on inside. Every time eyes would swell up with tears at work today, I told myself "fake it till you make it" and forced myself to crack a smile.  I'm trying to quite the voices of blame and be kind to myself, its hard. Thank you

I also asked to be tested for  Hep C which is controversial if sexual transmitted or not ... and takes 6 months to show up on testing. HIV I was told I should be retest at 3 month and than a third time at 6 months just to be safe.  I had it all done today even a throat swab for gonorrhea. 

- worried as I been having unprotected sex with him :(
