Do you think their comments are more just joking because they're uncomfortable and feel challenged by your healthy choices? In that case, it's not so much that they're deluded and could use some explanation, as that they're just being rude.

Next time you're on the phone or something, you might just start talking about how good a recent meal you had was - to alleviate any real concern they have, but also as an opportunity to share some of what you've learned about what food is healthier. If anyone's open to it after a while, volunteer to cook for them. If they're not, just respond with a general 'my doctor and I are happy, though what a change, right!' If they prod more, share more. If they complain you're preaching, you can just shrug 'oops, sorry, I thought you were curious. Anyways, what's new in your life/how 'bout them sports/did you that movie?"

Though that sucks. Really you might also tell anyone you're close to that you're healthy, consult with your doctor, and don't like them questioning your accomplishments.
