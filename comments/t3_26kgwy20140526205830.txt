I have left before once, I went back to my parents and his mom came and picked him up from the apartment we shared. He tried to jump out of the car going 60mph down the highway. This was when we got over our addictions, and I let him sweet talk me back into a relationship. My parents got understandably upset when they found out I was talking to him again, and took my car away and called my boss to let her know I needed time off for personal reasons. This sent me off the deep end and I moved back in with him at his parents house. I got my job back, but I have no car and no means to get one right away. This makes me feel stuck. Any other family I could stay with is too far away to keep my current job, which stresses me out to wondering how I would support myself in their rural area. I just feel so stuck and scared, and I know what I need to do. It hangs over my head the thought of how guilty I would be if he did commit suicide as a result of me leaving. I am 23, and he's 26 btw.
