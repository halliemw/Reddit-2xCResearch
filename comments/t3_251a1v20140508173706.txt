> By devaluing their savings, which is terrible for the elderly especially.

It's exactly what it does, and the elderly should have their money in some form of stock or bond/situation where it keeps up inflation.

>No it doesn't, inflation can only be created by more government debt.

It reduces previous debt.  So far as I am aware the government creates inflation by printing money and buying things with it, not by going into debt.

>And people also have to take out more loans and go further into debt because of higher prices. That's good for our banking friends on Wall Street but terrible for the poor.

It also allows people to buy homes, cars, and similar.  So long as it's not a bubble situation there is nothing wrong with it.
