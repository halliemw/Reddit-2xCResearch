Of course. If someone is texting someone a million times a day or divulging too much too soon....there are a million things someone can do wrong. 

But I find too often people did NOTHING wrong and over-analyze every normal interaction trying to figure out what they did to drive someone away. "Did I respond too soon? Did I not respond soon enough? Did I put out too soon? Did I not put out soon enough?" And really it's just a matter of chemistry. 

I guess that's my TL;DR for that advice column.
