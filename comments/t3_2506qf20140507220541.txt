> I think that is a ridiculous idea, people who are really overweight and really want to loose weight are the only ones who need to count calories.

This is simply incorrect. No matter how you put it, if there is a mismatch between the amount you burn and the amount you consume, that mismatch should be regulated. (And this is equally true for a little overweight, under weight and dystrophic people, by the way.)

In many cases it is even necessary to *maintain* weight, if, again, there is a significant mismatch between *desired* consumption (usually due to habit or childhood starvation) and *necessary* consumption.

> If you can focus on getting a diverse amount of vegetables, fruits, and high-quality protein daily you don't need to count calories.

This is simply badly incorrect. You are definitely right to say that this diversity is far more important than the raw number of calories (i.e., a diverse diet w/ overeating is much better than a non-diverse diet w/ a correct number of calories), but one does not exclude the other.

This, and generally speaking, when tracking the number of calories, the individual nutritional elements are also tracked.

> 11-13 year old girls already have enough crazy messages coming at them, giving them a complex about how much food they should be eating is not something they need at that age at all.

If the material I mentioned is taught in such a way that it forms a complex in the target audience, than it unquestionably should not be taught, no doubt there. But I challenge the assumption that it is bound to necessarily create this complex. And if this assumption is lifted... the suggestion becomes much less ridiculous.
