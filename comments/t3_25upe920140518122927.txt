This is more possible than people realise. I used to think this would be impossible until we actually sat down and worked out what we did and didn't *need* and built a budget from there. 


It really is not that hard to survive on even a moderate income with a simplistic lifstyle. My job is to now be frugal with the money my husband gives me (we worked out what the household needed and I spend the household money).


I guess it's just about setting priorities.
