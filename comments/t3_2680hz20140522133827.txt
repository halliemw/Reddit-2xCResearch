Like I said in response to someone else on this thread, a lot of the problem came from the fact that I went from rarely experiencing long term attention from men to almost always experiencing it. 

I don't have dating experience with many men. I have primarily dated women my whole life. I met my current boyfriend and had an established friendship with him for a while before we began to get closer in intimacy. This is how I am used to handling situations with the women that I've dated as well. It is a norm for me and none of my relationships have started on the foundation of my looks alone. There has always been more complexity to it than that.

Everyone is different and reacts to things differently. 
Like I said before, it isn't men asking me out that bothers me, but rather how impersonal it feels. I hate having my looks play a factor in any situation I'm in. I am mostly just frustrated because I want to be able to be friends with guys and have that be the basis of our interaction not the fact that they found me attractive first and then decided to get to know me.
