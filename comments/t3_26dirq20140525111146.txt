don't know how I forgot about Big....that'd be another guy with a reference to being fat right in his goddamn name.  You see articles with titles like "Larger women who rock?  HOT! Our top fifteen plus size divas" and "How [overweight female performer] proved the haters wrong" and "Large and in charge - plus sized ladies who tipped the scales of success....and sexiness!" every forty seconds even without seeking out material meant for women.  Can you even attempt to imagine an article praising and encouraging the sexuality of John Popper and Rick Ross?  "Big Boys of Rock - Ten Overweight Singers Cosmo still finds Crushworthy!" NO.  This person https://media.zenfs.com/en_us/Movies/PhotoG/seth-rogen-2009-24818.jpg has a career literally made of a mountain of fat jokes.  Adam Pally is all over TV comedy now http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/brief-chat-with-happy-endings-adam-pally.html  he is also never far from a fat joke.  To be accepted by the public they basically have to go around going "HEY!  haha, I know, I'm a fat piece of shit!  haha!  I'm so fat, look at me just fattin' around! I'm gonna take off my shirt next to a ripped guy now! haha, I'm so fat and useless!" And neither one of them is even fat., having a higher BMI is all it takes for a guy to be categorized.  And have you ever heard a guy called "plus sized" instead of just fat?  Never in your life.  The reality is that not only are women not remotely persecuted for this, they are coddled and validated and supported to an absurd, cartoonish degree relative to men AND STILL SOMEHOW GET TO COMPLAIN.  Does reality just not matter to people with opinions anymore?  for the record, I'm not just a bitter fat dude, I just RECENTLY became fat, so - twice the bitters.  I'm shiverin from all the bitters
