My father and grandfather both passed away while I was on the road to see them, and my Grandma Bea had Alzheimer's too. While everyone has different experiences, I identify with yours.

Now that I have this rare chance to say goodbye, I feel like I am messing it up though, or at least that I could be doing/saying something better. "I love you" doesn't seem to cover it.
