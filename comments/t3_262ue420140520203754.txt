I just got my 2nd Mirena a few weeks ago. I never checked for strings the whole first 5 years. I wasn't told to. A year ago, I was told the strings weren't visible, but they could have just shrunk up a bit inside. Since I didn't have any changes (my periods didn't start back up, etc) I didn't worry about it, because my Gyn wasn't. She did warn me that if they moved too far up they'd have to do a procedure under anesthesia to remove it, but most women this happens to they just use misoprostol and a numbing agent and can still get it out. This is just what happened. Getting the new one inserted was crampier. I will say, that my Gyn checks about 4 weeks out from initial insertion w/ an ultrasound just to be sure it is in place correctly, but not again for the rest of the time.
