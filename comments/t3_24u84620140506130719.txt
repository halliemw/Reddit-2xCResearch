The movie industry could definitely use more super heroines, but I don't know that Wonder Woman is the answer. She's just not a compelling or interesting hero, IMO, and her misogynistic origins are problematic even now. Plus they'd have to do something about her ridiculous costume. If they do a Wonder Woman movie she's going to need a serious reboot.
