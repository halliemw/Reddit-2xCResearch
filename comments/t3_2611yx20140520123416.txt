Thanks a lot for mentioning that! I just looked it up and in my state, the company decides how breaks are managed. Even if this wasn't the case, my boss never has a reason to yell at me for it, she just complains about me being back already. I can't help it if I don't take that much time to eat, though. But, whenever I tell her this, she seems to get even more upset. 
I guess the other stuff you're saying also make sense. I do try to look pretty every day, but that's just how I've always been (for myself, not others); it makes me happy.
