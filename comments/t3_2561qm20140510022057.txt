Yeah... 6 months of reduced pay is one thing, 10 years of child care is something else. One of our provinces has managed to finagle $7/day childcare (and 6 weeks of parental leave exclusive to men in addition to more universal parental leave and maternal leave) and it was a smashing success.... but they are still working on access, and that province spends more than it makes for its social programs and leans on the rest of the country for support. So... obviously there are considerations.
