Trying to paint this man as being representative of society at large "like most young American men" is pathetic and wrong. Austistic people struggle to access or understand normal society. This man could not and did not access or understand normal society, he found some very niche areas of the internet which fuelled his obsession (obsession is a common autistic trait). Such niches can be found online for every bad thing you can think of, but that does not make the view found there representative.

Nothing about him or his view is "normal and expected", earlier today I read a thread he started a few months ago on a body-building forum - pretty much the most mainstream masculine forum you can find - where he expressed misogony, a lack of self awareness and also racism towards Indian men (he didn't only have a problem with women). All the other male posters on this forum behaved in what I would describe as the "normal and expected" way a masculine environment would handle such claims: they pointed out how wrong his views were, they mocked him, they argued against him and they called him a troll. They certainly didn't think what he said was "commonplace or justified".

The elephant in the room this article skips around is American gun culture and attitude towards killing. This man was diagnosed autistic and was "receiving professional help" for his obvious mental illness, yet he was still able to legally buy guns. You can't stop some people being mentally ill, aggressive, narcissistic, misogynist or autistic but you can and should stop them arming themselves.
