> It seems like you can't say much of anything unless it's negative, argumentative, and/or condescending.

You may want to reflect on the idea that someone disagreeing with you doesn't automatically make their contribution "negative, argumentative, and/or condescending". Sometimes, you're just wrong, and the people who truly grasp the concept and power of rational thought understand that having their positions challenged makes them stronger, not weaker. Desiring only smiley-happy affirmation of your pre-existing worldview means that it is rotting from the inside out.

It's almost as though I'm on a discussion board to have a discussion. Also, who is this "us" you're suddenly speaking for?
