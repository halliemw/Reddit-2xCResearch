I'd recommend talking to an attorney licensed in your state. Some states don't require you to "serve" the other party, some do. Generally the process is that you get a temporary (or "emergency") restraining order and then at a later court hearing it can be made permanent.

If you *do* get a permanent restraining order, you may wish to contact Department of Homeland Security to try to get him added to the list of people barred from the US. Including copies of arrest reports and court cases (the other women's as well as yours) will greatly increase the chance that he can never come back to the US to harass you or any other woman.

Sounds like New York state to me. Showing the restraining order that you have (and a copy from other women he's harassed if they've gotten one), arrest records and court cases should help them change their minds. The folks over at /r/CCW/ should be able to give some advice on getting past the hurdles.

Kickboxing is also a great workout.
