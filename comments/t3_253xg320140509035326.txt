I second the vote to visit /r/weddingplanning.  It's great if you need to rant or bounce ideas off people.  Plenty of women in the subreddit don't have wedding parties for one reason or another.

Don't worry about having a "small" guest list.  I'm getting married July 2015 and my guest list is only 50-60.
