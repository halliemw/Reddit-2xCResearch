I came here to suggest you write letters but /u/fakey_mcfakerson beat me to it.  However, I like her idea of the videos much more.  You stated that your wife is a bit in denial about the situation.

>She has told me many times that a major coping mechanism for her is pretending that Iâ€™ll just go on living, and she doesn't want to talk about her fears, etc.. 

Perhaps, recording these videos with you may be a good way to help her come to terms with what is about to happen.  You don't need to talk about your death directly in them, but the act of recording the videos in preparation for your death may help her.  Maybe knowing that the videos are for your children may convince her to participate if she is hesitant to do so.


I know you came here mostly to ask for advice about your wife and daughter, however, can I respectfully suggest something for your son?  Perhaps you could plan to leave him something (letters or a video) just for him, that he can read or watch as he gets older and in need of male advice.  This could be your opportunity to share with him your thoughts on sex, dating, relationships, shaving techniques, etc.  For example, you may record a video titled "When you are ready to start shaving" in which your record yourself shaving and narrating the process and advice.  Maybe you can give him a USB with video clips that are just for him.  

I have to say, your story has touched me a lot.  Especially because there are many parallels in our lives (although I'm probably a couple years older).  I dated my husband for 9 years and have been married for 15 1/2 years and we also have two kids, a boy (10) and a girl (13).  I wish you and your family all the best.
