I think people get too caught up in the letter of the law and forget the spirit of the law. It is nigh impossible to make laws perfectly reflect what we mean by them. Also society changes and our understanding of what is right gets better clarified. 

There are still plenty of places where spouses cannot rape spouses. But we ALL (decent, ethical people) agree now that is bullshit. Marriage does not grant you rights over someone's genitals.

Rape is having sex without full informed consent. Therefore it covers a lot of possibilities. From someone misleading a person incapable of consent like a minor, someone cohercing someone into sex by blackmail, someone beating the shit of someone and having sex with their bodies, someone noticing a passed out or too drunk to consent party goer and having sex with their bodies etc. 

One horrific thing does not rank higher on the horrific scale than other. It is unseemly to try to rank horrificness of an act that is without a doubt a gross act of violence. If someone tricks somebody into thinking they were their boyfriend and has sex with them - they are rapists. They are not less rapists than the guy snatching a person walking on the street and raping them in an alley. Let's not get into a competition of what is rape rape and almost rape and rapey and not really rape but kinda fucked up. 

If impregnation cannot be characterized as rape and"just" as sexual assault than it's just as fucked up and not "kinda rape". It's fucked. We can all agrre on that. It violates consent. No need for horrificness olympics
