I was happy that they feature skinnier models as well (some of the models for different cup sizes are skinnier). I think the "real" aspect is that they've not been photoshopped to be a different size or appearance. I was also glad that they featured models for smaller cup sizes, because typically the models featured fall somewhere in the middle.
