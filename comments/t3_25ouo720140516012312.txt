I can dress in a million and two ways and it's still acceptable! I can wear my pink sundress and matching shoes one day and my goth raver pants and tennis shoes the next. I'm not limited to a shirt/pants/shoes combo.

It's socially acceptable for me to have feelings and share them with other people. No one's going to call me creepy for needing a hug.

I get boobs. I get pillows. On. My. Chest. Bras kind of suck but boobs are amazing.

I don't have to deal with awkward boners.
