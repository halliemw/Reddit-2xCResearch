True, I fully agree you don't have to be feminine to be a woman. I rarely wear dresses or get manicures, things typically identified as feminine, but I definitely feel I am a woman. But it still doesn't answer my question of what does it really mean to identify as a woman, how is it essentially different from being a man? I hope that makes sense.
