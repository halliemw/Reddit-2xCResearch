What I love about pole is there's no set level of progression. It's not like you need to get this move before that higher difficulty move--different moves just come more naturally to different people bc of their body types. I've been doing pole for about a year and a half now, and there are some moves I can do that the girl who taught me can't do--but of course there are a zillion moves she found really easy that I just can't figure out! I would say if you're interested, just find a class near you and get started. I bet you'll be amazed at what you can do, even if you have little to no preliminary upper body strength--& what's also great about pole is it's so fun that you'll build strength quickly from practice without it feeling like work ;)

Also, flexibility is helpful--but not necessary! Again, another great thing about pole is there is such a vast expanse of moves, if there are ones you physically can't do (I have several poler friends who are technically disabled, whether due to past spinal injury or genetic disorder) you can still have a solid repertoire under your belt of moves that just don't involve shit you can't do. So, if you're not bendy, there might be some classic moves you can't do, but you can still be a beautiful dancer / get a great workout / have a fantastic performance / whatever you want out of it :)
