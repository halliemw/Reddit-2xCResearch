I wear a woman's size 6 and have had the same problems. Went from store to store with everyone telling me that these "unisex" size 6 are the same as a woman's 6. What I needed was a "Men's" 4.5. I found some non-OSHA steel toes but nothing for real work.   I finally was convinced to use Zappos. I found some docs that are anzi rated, and a good fit.  

Yours look great. I'm glad you found some actual work boots in a store.
