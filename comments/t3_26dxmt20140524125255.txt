Never used condoms but I have and IUD and highly recommend it. It uses progesterone (most pills use estrogen) and another IUD is non-hormonal so it might be worth looking into. It's extremely effective (1 in 1000+ chance) and you can't "forget" as it stays in place for up to 5 years (10 if you use the non-hormonal). It might be worth looking into if you get tired of condoms or if you're really nervous that they'll slip or break. I'm not sure but you might try asking Planned Parenthood if they do IUDs for really cheap. Pros - no periods and fewer hormone fluctuations. Cons - first three days are really crampy but it goes away soon.
