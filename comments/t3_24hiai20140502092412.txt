Well hey - feel free to PM me if you need it.  =)  

It's great that you are actively working to get better.  Please don't forget that - it's *so* important.  

And I totally do believe in you.  There's no reason whatsoever that you won't be able to leave these jerks behind and have an amazing, wonderful life.  You will.  

You graduate in a couple of months, right?  Believe me, *everything* is different.  My asshole HS boyfriend cheated on me and broke up with me about mid-April of senior year.  I had to spend the next couple of months around that piece of shit (seriously, he is *not* a good human being, our relationship aside).  I really do get this.  =/  It takes time to get to the "you are *such* a piece of shit" stage after something like that happens to you.  Don't beat yourself up because you're the good person here.  Of course you still care!  You built a huge part of your life around this guy and he basically shit on it.  It's awful, but that doesn't mean your feelings just disappear.   

So the next couple of months, focus on YOU.  Do things YOU like.  Ask your friends to run interference.  Keep him away from you, keep you occupied.  Do the stuff he didn't like to do but you did, go have fun with the people who care about you.  And if you don't feel like going to prom, don't.  I didn't.  I still don't care.  I mean, it's *one* dance that you have to pay a shitload of money for.  One school-sponsored event isn't that big in the grand scheme of things, especially if it means you'll be miserable if you go!  

And something I didn't say - I'm really sorry you're dealing with all of this shit.  You don't deserve it.  I see a lot of similarities in what I went through at the end of high school, and man, that is a raw deal.  But if I could manage to get through it, so can you.  =)
