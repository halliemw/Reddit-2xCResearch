Thank you so much for saying this. I can definitely relate and have had guys tell me that I'm not like other 'normal Asians' and even become violent when they realise I don't adhere to the fucked up docile fantasy in their minds. 

Funny enough, I notice this creeps up more with guys who have had no contact with westernised Asians and I'm even hesitant to believe that most women from Asia currently would be willing to put up with this bullshit, unless they wanted something in return. 

This submissive stereotype is so detrimental that I actually enjoy the other 'tigress' 'karate' labels because at least those labels make Asian women fierce, vocal and not to be messed with. I get that some Asian women are submissive by nature but the fact that some guys use this as an excuse to group a whole ethnicity makes me want to burn myself to the ground. Seriously?? Who or what is still perpetuating this stereotype?
