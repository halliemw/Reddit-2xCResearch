One person went and downvoted all the comments encouraging you to get one... don't understand why.  If you have a reason why an internet stranger *shouldn't* get one, maybe speak up?  

I advocate for getting one as well.  Minor pain and some discomfort for the first few months (for me anyways) and then it's home free for years!  Love it.
