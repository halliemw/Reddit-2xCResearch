I know! 
It does make one question what is and is not appropriate (for example, I see no problem if the art depicts zombies ripping people apart, but that might frighten someone else or make them uncomfortable). 
My own work (I don't draw, but I write) is on the darker side. It's mostly horror. I don't consider anything of mine to be hateful or inappropriate; the ultimate intent of horror is to make the reader/viewer uncomfortable, but I like to think that my work doesn't cross that line. I keep the violence and gore minimal or off-panel (Alfred Hitchcock once said there was nothing scarier than a closed door). Also, I don't hold it up because it's hard to do that with a script. The only people in my group who read my work are the folks in the writers' group, and that's a small group. Scripts are posted online and people can choose whether or not to read them. People can't exactly choose whether or not they want to look at the art, because it's held up and on display at the meeting.
