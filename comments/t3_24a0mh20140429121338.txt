>And WHY would he think it's okay to just hop on and have sex with her when she's in and out of consciousness

Did I miss somewhere the article actually says that she was 'in and out of consciousness'?  She was on some meds, but the only account the article gave of her actual condition (as far as I saw) was the boyfriend's account, which said she was acting normal, just tired.

Lots of people have sex with their partners while on pain meds.  I'm fine with holding the hospital responsible for letting him visit against hospital policy and the mother's request, but I'm not sure the article gives us enough information about her actual state to conclude that this isn't just a case of 'boy has consensual sex with girlfriend, sent to jail by angry mother.'
