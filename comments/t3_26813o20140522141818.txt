It's basically a well-written adaptation of League of Extraordinary Gentleman: including a sharp-shooter, vampires, and Dorian Grey (among others).

EDIT: I say adaptation, but I really mean that it has the same essence/universal feel. Timothy Dalton assembles a crew of familiar characters to find his daughter, who was taken captive by a supernatural being.
