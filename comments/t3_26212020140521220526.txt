>In a thread titled [Support] I had an abortion yesterday, comments suggesting that abortion is wrong will be removed. Comments suggesting that the OP made the wrong choice will be removed. Comments extoling the virtues of adoption will be removed.

I agree with this, as a woman contemplating abortion is going through a tough choice. I have no issue with a support tag for issues such as that.

> Any comments that could be construed as criticism or judgement of the OP or their choices will be removed in [Support] threads.

This does not sound like a good idea. In circumstances/situations such as abortion, I get it, and understand why the mods want to do this. Beyond situations such as that, I'm leery of the idea of the "support" tag. Not just in this subreddit, but any subreddit. Constructive criticism (where appropriate, of course: not in a thread on abortion/rape) is essential to a good discussion. Censorship of comments (beyond obvious trolls/assholes) is not.

Edit: I'm not trying to sound insensitive at all, I'm just not sure how to phrase what I'm saying well. I'm worried that it could be abused, i.e., something like "my son is gay how can I make him 'normal'?" Idk.
