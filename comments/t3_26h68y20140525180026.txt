If your her good friend you should only offer advise when asked and be happy for everything she is happy for. When there's an opening, point out the obvious and leave it at that. This is her life and not yours. YOU AREN'T LIVING IT. You may be right, but sometimes its best to shut up and watch the show. It sounds like she's being phony. And at the appropriate time that would be some good advise. Sometimes there just isn't an appropriate time. I've learned this with my kids. Instead of being controlling and telling them what they are doing wrong all the time, I just watch, and listen, and only give advise when asked. They come around more often that way too.
