I think both BMI and the Bechdel test are applicable to individuals, you just need to apply them with a little consideration - if the movie fails the Bechdel test it'd better have a reason (say, there are only two characters in the movie, one's a man and one's a woman; instant technical fail) and if you have a BMI of 40, you're either overweight or *extremely* muscular.
