Thanks, you too :)

This website: www.jjshouse.com/ I've bought bridesmaid dresses from there before as have friends. You hear a lot of people say they are scammy/poor quality but they are not at all! I had to get a $370 bridesmaid dress locally and it was the same quality as the $77 one I got from this website (same material). The measurements on the website are accurate too, though I had to spend $20 getting it tailored to fit better. This is quite typical even with local dresses as I also had to get my local made to measure dress tailored as well.
