Yeah, it would be a more difficult thing to manage than "Is this historically accurate," and OP's would have to be exposed. It really is too bad. Not everyone is up to laughing off or ignoring or just being pissed for 10 seconds at asshat comments and PMs. 

I hope along with everyone else that most of the nonsense dies down and the asshats go on to their next little tea party. It would be great if they's quit being jerks, but we can't hold our breath.

I'm sure more private subreddits will come to life.
