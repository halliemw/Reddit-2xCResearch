Yeah, no doubt that a large percentage of the population treat women poorly.  
It's fucked up that 1/5 women in the U.S. reported they had experienced attempted/successful rape. 1 in 6 reported that they had previously been stalked.  
So no doubt there is a huge issue here.    
Luckily, it does seem that it's getting better with time:

I would argue that if you could do something like that you are not normal.
