Regardless of how I feel it is morally, how do you feel? Do you feel guilty or angry or icky? Does it feel wrong to have sex with a person who badgers you to do it? If you answer yes, then you know if this kind of sex is right for *you.*

Step back for a second and pretend you have no history with this guy. It's merely someone you're attracted to, bugging you for sex. Would you say yes if this history was removed? If you're making an exception for this guy just because he's your ex, you might want to re-examine your contact with him.
