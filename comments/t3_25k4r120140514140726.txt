You have made valid points on both sides ... ending your pregnancy or continuing.

My only advice is to not listen to a strangers advice here on reddit but to seek out someone you know to help with your decision or seek counseling. 

The choice is yours and not your boyfriends parents despite their beliefs.

Hope you are OK either way.
