I think I'm hesitant because I love my current company, I just for stuck in a bad store. But you're right. I'm excited to be a real manager (not a "lead" or "specialist" where I get management authority but not the pay or title) and I think I would be waiting a long time to get that where I am now. Thanks for the advice!!
