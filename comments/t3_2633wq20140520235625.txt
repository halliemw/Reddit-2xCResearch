I defintley think you both can be friends! Especially since the friendship is 12 years old. Are you interested in being friends with his girlfriend? That might be what it takes to get the door back open..
I understand her anxiety and depression issues may make it harder for his gf to accept somebody else back into their lives. Even though she knew of you prior to her moving/moving back from AU, you were out of the picture for awhile.  By her saying she didn't want him to have fun without her it seems like she is scared of something (maybe she has the same outlook as your mother?).  Looks like you're going to have to put a little more hard work into the friendship to get everything as close to pre-AU as possible, lol. (: Good luck!
