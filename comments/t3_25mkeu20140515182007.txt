Maybe I can get in on this earlier enough to ask:

Do people really frown on flushing tampons? I've been using them for 10 years or so and have never not flushed them. Public toilets, my house, other's houses. Isn't that the point? I've lived in places w/ water wells, connected to city sewer, houses, apts, condos. What sort of sewage system can't handle a tampon?
