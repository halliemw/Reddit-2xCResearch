>The problem lies with men who insist on sexualizing women. Stop doing that. Problem solved. 

What you're suggesting flies in the face of tens of thousands of years of evolution. It's the equivalent of suggesting to people that they not be startled by loud noises.

It also ignores that the issue here isn't simply the boys sexualizing the girls. Sexualization, evolutionary impetus aside, is a cultural thing. The boys have learned, from both women and men, that they ought to be attracted to girls. It's obvious that it's on the boys to control themselves, but suggesting that the outfit, and by extension you, play no part in this strikes me as a little dishonest.

(It goes without saying the dress code should be enforced equally for girls and boys.)
