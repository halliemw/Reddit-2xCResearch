>My fiancee has unquestioning faith which shows up in the smallest statements. Platypus: "I don't know what God was thinking when he made those." I don't think she's a 6000 year earth believer, but she believes a lot more than I ever will. That's ok though, because I know she'll always be there for me, and her faith will keep us afloat no matter what happens.

I think he wants to be with someone like this. I realize that that's not me. I don't know how badly he wants/needs this.
