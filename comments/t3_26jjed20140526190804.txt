This! We had someone write a threatening message on our patio last summer. We figured it was just bored teenagers but we called the non-emergency line anyway. They came out and documented it. The message was "your next" - I joked that because of the improper grammar they were just interrupted before they could finish their sentence. The police advised that they hadn't had any other issues at that time so whatever was "next" was a mystery. They also thought it was bored teens. We went and talked to our neighbors to so that they could be on the lookout.
