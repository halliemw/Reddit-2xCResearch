I had been pushing him for engagement for years. I got the vibe he was *finally* going to purpose and had a freak out. He had put it off long enough that I had become comfortable. I didn't need change anyone, change is scary. I called my mom in a panic. I told her that I didn't want him to pop the question anymore.  She convinced me that I was crazy and that he wasn't planning anything... After all, he would probably tell her first.

He did because he needed my ring size. The crafty liar that my mom is, I had no idea. A few weeks later he proposed. We celebrate 4 years this Thursday, which will also be my 3 year reddit cake day!
