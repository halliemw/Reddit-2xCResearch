Because right now there is a lot more attention on us than just default attention, we want to be sure the voices we are hearing are from our community not the other subreddits that are using this opportunity to troll and complain about "women being on the front page excluding them". I want to be very clear here, we do realize a lot of our regulars are unhappy. Not all the dissent is from outside, maybe not even a majority, but we really want to see the dust settle a bit before we consider something like that. There are also many of our regulars that see the pluses to this and we want to make sure they're heard as well.

There was a poll put up but that poll allowed people to vote at many times as they wished as well as being put up during the biggest part of the shitstorm.
