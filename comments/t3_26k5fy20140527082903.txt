That article is totally insane.

Even aside from the actually insane, sexist content, it's bad for our societal health to complain about "too many female doctors," because research generally concludes that female doctors are less likely to make mistakes, and far less likely to commit the kind of egregious errors that would get them suspended/punished. And of course those suspensions take doctors entirely out of the work force for their duration.

As someone who has been the victim of multiple medical screwups at the hands of male doctors with "good ol' boy" country club attitudes, I can't understand this kind of article AT ALL.
