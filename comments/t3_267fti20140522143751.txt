>I'm sure feminist Muslims exist. Typically they don't believe that you need to cover up your head for modesty.

LOL, you'd be surprised. Especially the religious brand of muslim feminist thinkers consider the hijab essential to their kind of feminism. 

That is something many western feminist fail to understand -  in most muslim women's eyes the hijab is a symbol of liberation, not oppression. 

The religious revival of islam since the 1970s and the more widespread wearing of hijab has liberated a lot women that used to be confined to their houses in areas where the saying went that a good woman only left her house twice - on the day of her wedding as a bride and on the day of her death in coffin. Wearing hijab these women were allowed to leave the houses they used to be confined to. With hijab they can go to school, university and have a job. They can even work in mixed sexes environments. 

It is a slow revolutionary change in countries around the Mediterranean and the Middle East that has been going on almost unnoticed by western feminists. Western feminists focus on the outward symbol of hijab while muslim women focus on the rights that matter - divorce, keeping your children, being allowed to work, having access to safe birth control and abortion, inheritance rights, ... 

It is a simple question of knowing how to pick your battles and weapons. As far as many muslim women in predominantly muslim countries are concerned, hijab is their weapon and their ally. 

This is why banning hijab is so potentially destructive. If you are deeply religious muslim you consider the hijab a commandment, being forcefully forbidden to wear one would limit these women to indoor stay.
