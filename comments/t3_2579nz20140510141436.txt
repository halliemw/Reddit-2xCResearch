Well, even though the word "suicide" isn't specifically used, the very first question on the first pamphlet you linked asks "Are you afraid of your partner?" amongst other questions that could all be answered with "yes" if your partner were threatening you with suicide. I can understand the confusion, but even the ones you linked could provide the advice /u/DJDanaK was implying exists, despite not using the word "suicide" specifically.
