This is where our opinions respectively differ. I don't think men should police themselves, nor should they go troll-hunting. As I said earlier, trolls should be diligently reported and warned or banned by the mods. As for women generalizing men, I actually haven't seen much of this on 2X. If you could provide links, I'd appreciate it.

Nor am I slamming men. However, I won't praise men either. Asking us to appreciate something we don't want and didn't ask for is inappropriate. We as a sub didn't ask to become a default. Everyone's trying to figure out what this means and how it affects the sub right now. Guys who aren't interested can just carry on as usual; you don't need to try to carve out a place here just because.
