He was a cop, and left because of "politics."

The thing is I am on the fence. He does not stalk me. He waits for me to contact him and is never demanding of me or my time.

Its just he has mean world syndrome so I dont know if this means he might have stalkerish tendancies. 

I like him physcially, he is tall and looks in his 30s. But I just dont want to have to end it and have him devastated or stalk me. Ugh. Its like guys are two different people during and after the realtionship(unless they end it first).
