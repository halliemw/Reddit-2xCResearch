Congrats on your upcoming day OP! I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling lonely. I am pretty confident that my wedding (if I ever find someone) will likely be a similar situation. I've found that some women in /r/weddingplanning are feeling the same way in regards to a lack a female friendships and a small guest list. 

Chin up. It is YOUR wedding after all. Who says your special day as to follow some specific guidelines. It only needs to be what you feel comfortable with. If that means that two people are at the alter with a intimate guestlist so be it. :)
