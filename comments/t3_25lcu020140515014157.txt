Guy here, I rode a girl bike as a kid because they are **better**!

We were poor, I got a bike, it turned out to be a girl bike, I did not know or care because it was red! Fuck yeah! 

Then one day someone tells me it's a girl bike. I didn't even know there was a difference! They explain that boy bikes have that extra bar. Well that's fucked up, I replied. I'm the one with his genitals hanging out of his body to be easily injured, why the fuck would I want that bar there? Plus girl bikes are about a million times easier to get on and ditch. Especially if you must ditch right before a crashing into a fence because you were going at an insane speed down hill. 

I stuck with my girl bike. And even as an adult today, if I should return to cycling I would use a girl bike.
