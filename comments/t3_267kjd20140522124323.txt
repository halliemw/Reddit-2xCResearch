Going off birth control was a nightmare for me. I originally went on to regulate my period and to help with acne when I was around 16. When I went off BC (around 21 also) my acne returned with a vengeance, scarring my face in the process. My period also was not occurring regularly when I went off the pill. I ended up going back on, my skin cleared up and my period went back to being regular. I'm not planning on going off for the foreseeable future.
