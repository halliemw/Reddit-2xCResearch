I can only offer you advice from the perspective of an alcoholic, because I am one. I believe it is too dangerous for you to step into his relationship, and it will not result in anything positive. I believe you have done all you can for his new girlfriend.

You cannot get your ex to stop drinking. There is nothing you can say or do that will make him quit. I think it's a little odd she's contacting you and I would be wary of it. If I was in her situation, I would contact his parents or his old rehab group, but not the ex as you can't provide anything additional to this situation. I don't mean to be mean, only blunt - but whatever you did to get him sober last time, it didn't work. You do not hold the answers for how to keep him sober. 

I believe that alcoholism is a "spiritual" disease meaning that alcoholics have problems, even without alcohol in their system. Hallmark traits of alcoholics include manipulation, selfishness, and self-delusion. It is possible he has asked his new girlfriend to contact you, and has some ideas about what to do if he gets your information. His history of violence sounds very serious, and will only get worse as he continues to drink. Alcoholism changes people. I was so radically different year to year, girlfriend to girlfriend that I was often unrecognizable to my old friends. Sometimes better, like when I got really into fitness and better style, or moved to a new city and took a new job, and more often times worse like how I gained weight, started smoking, stopped working out, stopped being a part of my community. Although you knew him, you do not know what he's like now. What he likes, doesn't like, what makes him happy, calm, safe, angry, stressed can all be different as prolonged alcohol abuse begins to change the brain. 

You've done all you can. Take it from me who has been in very dark and depressed places thanks to alcohol - there is nothing you can do.
