I hate the BBT for these exact reasons...the women on that show are nothing more than plot devices to make the men appear interesting. I do try to watch it because my boyfriend likes it, but I always ragequit before the episode is even over. The whole "nerds are cool" thing is really obnoxious to me, so that adds to it, too.
