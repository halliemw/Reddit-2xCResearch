Yes he's required to ask questions, but he's supposed to take allegations seriously, and from OP's story, it seems that the officer already new she was making it up before he even listened. Innocent until proven guilty applies both ways - you can't assume someone is just wasting police time until you have evidence of that. There's no proof she's lying, so she should be taken seriously and her complaint investigated. 

There's a world of difference between a police officer saying, "I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do" and "drunken idiots deserve to be raped". Questions such as;
> how she knows she hadn't consented if she had been drunk

and 

>why she didn't scream or push him off of her

suggest that this guy could do with some sensitivity training. The fact that *some* people are falsely accused doesn't meant the right thing to do is to start treating all women like drunken liars.
