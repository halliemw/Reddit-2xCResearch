I've been in your shoes, except I was 20 and just started my dream job.  I faced embarrassment, loss of career, and financial distress.  I had the baby anyway.  If was a hard decision, and it's been a long road, but that boy is 14 now and I am so thankful he is here.  Just my two cents.  Pm me if you need someone to talk to.
