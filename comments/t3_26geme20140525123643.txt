I know it's as stupid as telling someone depressed to just "be more positive"... it's a complicated situation and you're the only expert here. Even though the diet and workout is little progress, I'm hoping it's still some. I bet the weight wasn't gained overnight either, and you got to remember: Weight loss is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Mind you, nobody has called you a failure or disgusting, these are your own words (try catching yourself being mean to yourself, it's not a good mindset!). Your friends are just worried and concerned, and that's great! Because that means they care, and they'll be there to support you when you need it... all they want is for you to do your best, that's the difference between failures, they give up or don't even try. Don't worry OP, if weight is your number one issue, you're having a good life.
