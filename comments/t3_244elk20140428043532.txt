I'll add a truth to that. I don't encroach on women personal space until the relationship is established with more than a high five. Love hugs. Love high fives. Just want her to be comfortable. Working at a bar. You see creeps a lot.  Not thrilled to be guy. Terrified to be a woman. Has taught me how to not act though.
