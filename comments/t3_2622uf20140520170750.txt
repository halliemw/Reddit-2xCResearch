" he does not believe he could emotionally detach himself from it feeling like murder. He said it would eat at him forever."

translation - i couldn't live with knowing that i was part of the decision to murder a fetus. 

implication - if shit hits the fan and you need an abortion, please don't tell me about it, because i will feel bad for the rest of my life.
