What one can do and what one should do are two different questions.  I was questioning the morality of such behavior.  Private parties can be as restrictive as they want on the sort of speech they want to "hear" and allow.  Whether anyone with an open mind would wish to talk around such prudes is another matter.  If I know someone is censoring some speech which they find to be hateful, I don't know what other "hateful" speech they may also be removing.
