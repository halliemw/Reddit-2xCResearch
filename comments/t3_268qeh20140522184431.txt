Tbh I would change your phone number or stick up a voicemail/auto-reply to let people know that they should contact the company. Stop doing their work for them, you've no obligation to and it's probably putting more emotional stress on you. 

To be honest it sounds like they feel like they were paying you too much and decided it was easier to let you go rather than ask you to take a pay cut. :/ Which sucks and isn't right, but I've seen it happen in other areas. I would believe them when they say it was financial... In fact, this might be about the best way to be let go that there is, in terms of a sliding scale from 'sucky' to 'downright horrible' - it wasn't a reflection on your performance, it was about $$$. It's infuriating and the sort of thing that saps at your faith, though. 

I hope they're giving you a good recommendation letter! <3 Keep your chin up, with the amount of work you're doing they'll probably be poorer off without you, regardless of the dollars involved.
