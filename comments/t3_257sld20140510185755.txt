Apparently "ma'am" is offensive for making women feel old, now "miss" is offensive for making them feel too young...


How are people supposed to address female strangers? Im a girl, but i think this whole jumping to being offended thing is going way too far if people cant even address strangers in general words without offending them. 

So people should just cater to the neuroses of everyone in that case, just stop addressing eachother. No more "sir" or "ma'am" anything of the like, because those words are apparently offensive to somebody.
