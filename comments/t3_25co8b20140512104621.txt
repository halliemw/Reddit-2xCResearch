I switched from the pill to the Depo provera shot about a month and a half ago and I love it so far. Hasn't caused any change in my cycle (which is to say I don't cycle that often and there's been no change there) and the only side effect I've felt is occasional joint pain. It's not for everyone, but I was already taking the same type of hormone in pill form, so it was an easy switch. Also, yay! for not having to remember to take a pill everyday.
