You know, that's a big reason I find myself with very few friends. Women or not, people that talk like that about others just push me away. I believe we shouldn't judge others like that. But more importantly, I also see absolutely no point in being that way, you know? And unfortunately, one of the two ladies I'm talking about is actually head of HR, but since we are a small office, she's pretty much the only HR person around here. If my situation doesn't improve I will definitely seek another.
