So true.  No faith in police responses.

But, in some states, if a person was once a date/boyfriend/etc., it's easier to get a restraining order.  The first part of the restraining order process is simple in all states.  I am the type who would do the restraining order, because that's how I roll, but each circumstance is different (there are a couple of things that would make me rethink a restraining order...)
