When you are in public, such as dining at a restaurant, do you make a point of watching people?  Speaking for myself, when I am out I am aware of others around me, but out of politeness, or an innate sense of decorum I do not try to observe what others are up to.  It would be so weird to be dining with your family, for instance, and have the folks at the table next to yours craning their necks to see how you are dressed, what you ordered, and  how you chew your food.
