I'm super lazy but I'll do things like clean during ad breaks, it's only 2-3 minutes but in 4-5 spurts I can have the dishes done or have sorted my laundry. 

I've been unemployed for awhile and I found that if I don't turn my tv on in the morning I'm much more motivated to clean. Put the radio on. Some days I don't turn the tv on until my husband gets home at 430. 

If that doesn't work often I'll feel like cleaning late at night because I don't want to go to bed. Hahaha. I trick myself into feeling rebellious by staying up, but it's to clean so it's beneficial in the long run. 

I'll scrub my shower/ bathroom immediately before having a shower so that's less of a chore too.
