They would have, if they'd worn a floral print dress.  

OTOH, if she'd worn black pants and black jacket with virtually any shirt, this story wouldn't have happened.  

(I'm not saying that the unmarked, default garb of men should be universal, just saying).  

If a woman wants to advocate large-patterned floral prints as a way of dressing, she deserves support (but many of us do not follow celebrity fashion on Twitter).  What's sad is that she apparently didn't see the possibility of this happening.  I would have thought this was a deliberate choice on her part, because the dress is (to me) rather amusing.  It certainly pulls attention in a sea of solid colors (and against a red background).  

It's hard to say that it's ill-fitting, to me fit is entirely a matter of personal taste (to say it should have been tighter is narrow value-judgment).  But in general, large floral patterns do pull people's attention and stand out against any solid background.
