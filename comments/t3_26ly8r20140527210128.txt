Heh, it's kinda odd -- I'm from Norway, you see, and here I can tell you that carrying knives on your person is very much so illegal. You need either to have a work-related reason (like construction of sort) or a traditional/cultural reason (like wearing a [bunad!](http://www.norskflid.no/fileshare/filarkivroot/Bunad/Hordaland/Hardanger/Hardangerbunad/Hardanger_helfigur.jpg)) to wear one. 

BUT! If you ever are travelling by plane in Norway then it's suddenly okay to have a knife on your person, provided it's not longer than 3 inches.... Odd that.
