My post was removed, I just want to point out that the moderators are removing content critical of their actions and suspicious of their motives. I submitted the following self-post a few minutes ago which was promptly deleted because it "wasn't welcome for a guy to post complaining about women talking about their periods."

Title: This Subreddit is Ruined.

Who on earth thought making 2XC a default would be a good idea?

Top 3 posts are about periods, period tissue, and horror pregnancy stories. What happened to the heart of this place?

Posters are getting routinely harassed for no reason other than identifying themselves as female in a default subreddit. Common sense would tell anybody that this would be a terrible idea. I know that the /r/AskHistory mods declined to accept the admin's offer to default them, why didn't the 2XC mods do the same?

I have to think that the only reason was their desire for exposure and enhancing their own status as mods of a default, which probably opens doors to more control throughout the site.

Anybody up for a mass migration? Suggestions?
