I have to disagree. I have laughed at many dumb blonde jokes, despite the fact that I am blonde and not dumb and do not believe that being blonde makes someone dumb or that a blonde person is more likely to be dumb than any other person. The joke happens to be pointing at blondes, but overall is more about a funny situation or funny response to a situation that this fictional dumb blonde has found themselves in. I don't have to believe that blondes are dumb (and I don't) to get the humor behind a blonde joke, and I think the same can be said for jokes employing other types of humor. I don't have to think blondes are stupid to think the joke is funny, I have to think the situation or response to it is funny.

People don't have to like them and good for you and anyone else if they have never laughed at a racist, sexist, or bigoted joke, but I don't agree that you have to believe in the premise to find the joke funny.

ETA: I am in NO WAY trying to defend Hughley for his comments or "apology." In my mind, there is nothing close to humor in either and I think his comments were terrible. This is just my response to the comment it is a reply to.
