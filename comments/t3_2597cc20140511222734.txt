So I snagged a pair on my hubby's box briefs for the day.  It was awesome!  I love the feeling on full coverage and nothing slipping upward.  There's definitely a little bulk under my Levi's but not to bad.  I just order a pack of women's Hanes boy brief cut undies to try.  If those don't work out I'll try to find slimmer mens boxers.
