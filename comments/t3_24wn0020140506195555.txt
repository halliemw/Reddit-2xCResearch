I've had my Mirena for almost 2 years now.

I'm not gonna lie,you're likely going to be crampy for the rest of the night. You may spot a little for a few weeks,but after that,I haven't had any problems at all. I don't even get my period anymore!

How much was the procedure at Planned Parenthood? I'll need to get my replaced in a few years,but I don't know if I'll have the money:(
