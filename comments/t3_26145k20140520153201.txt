I think I'm possibly in some kind of surreal other universe, the one time (ONCE! In 25 years!) I've been talked at in the street it was awkwardly super polite. Where's my wolfwhistles dammit?!

(Obviously not a real complaint, they must be able to sense my inner crazy cat lady waiting to come out at them and therefore avoid me)
