You are entitled to your opinion as I am to mine.  And I don't want to turn this into a post war because that's not what 2X is about.  

The uterus doesn't exist in a bubble.  The uterus exists to house the products of conception, that's its purpose.  How does conception have nothing to do with sex?  Sex, conception, the uterus should not be paraded at graduation.  It is a celebration of 4 years of hard work for people who will soon enter the workforce.
