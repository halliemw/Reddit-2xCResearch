> an improper sexual remark or approach? I mean, yeah, they are women so he calls them whores, if they were men he'd call them sons of bitches or faggots by which he would mean to insult them in exactly the same way

Did you read what she said? He's specifically talking about them actually performing sex acts with customers. He chose the word "whore" quite intentionally.

He is an asshole to be sure, but it's fucking staggering that you think this is somehow not sexual in nature when he's the one who brought sex into the discussion.
