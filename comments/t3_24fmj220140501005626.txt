Congratulations. What is your major/what degree are you seeking? I've had a 4.0 semester exactly once. It isn't easy and I more or less don't apply myself that hard anymore. C's get degrees. It sounds lazy, but I burned myself out so hard trying to get the best grade possible. I get irritated at my pretty steady 3.6 but I prefer the 3.6 and also having time to socialize and relax. 

That isn't to undermine your achievement, just ranting. Congratulations again, I know how hard it is. Especially if you're like me and take more than 12 credits.
