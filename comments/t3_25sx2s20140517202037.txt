A slut is a woman who has had sex and enjoyed it.

Women are either virgins or whores according to some of the slugs we share this planet with.

I hate the term 'slut-shaming' because I hate the word slut and don't think it should be used to describe a woman, because very very rarely would you hear that term used against a man.

I'm not a fan of reclaiming words like these because the people that use the words as slurs don't accept them as reclaimed.. and it only seems that those words become more acceptable.

I agree that slut-shaming should not exist because you shouldn't even be buying into the notion of calling a woman a slut.
Slut shaming has been use for when people have been called out for having sex, but also when people have been called out for wearing a short dress and heels.

"Stop slut-shaming her, she can dress how she wants"
It still sounds like... she's a slut, and it's wrong to shame her for that, rather than implying firstly dress is nothing to do with her sexual proclivities and even if she did want to have sex with someone that does not make her a slut.
