I understand there are people in this world that are uncomfortable around guns, but I feel you should reconsider. 

Rods and other tools to stop a thief from getting into your home are great. However, if that thief has a gun, he has the power. You may find yourself underarmed with your self-defense tools and techniques. Just a thought.
