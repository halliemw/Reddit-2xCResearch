At this point, I completely agree with your opinion (and many others' here, too) that most of the questions were necessary. I do still disagree with how the officer went about the questioning and the tone he seemed to have used as well as the final decision that no foul play was involved. The rape kit was done days before the police report was filed. My friend made a point to get one the same day that the PP counselor told her that the evidence would only be viable for another 24 hours. Just because she didn't have the emotional capacity to report the crime to the police sooner doesn't mean that she didn't do her best to help with the evidence collection process. Unfortunately, the officer's attitude is what completely unraveled everything for her. She's moving beyond what happened to her, she is seeking professional counseling, and I'm here to help her with anything I can beyond that. She is barely dwelling on the experience with the police officer because she just doesn't have the capacity for it right now. That's why I posted this, because I know she will wish it was done eventually, but she is just as at a loss as I was. Fortunately, many comments here have helped me, though. And the advice I've gotten is how I plan to help her. I realize that none of this will happen without persistence or her willingness, so I'm lending her some persistence here. Neither of is expecting anyone else to "perform miracles".
