What are you talking about?

Everyone knows that lack of consent = sexual assault.  The problem is that it's not always clear what is meant by "consent."  There are multiple competing definitions of the consent, and different standards for when consent does or can exist.  How drunk is too drunk?  Does consent have to be completely verbal?  Etc.  People in this area need to work on improving clarity.
