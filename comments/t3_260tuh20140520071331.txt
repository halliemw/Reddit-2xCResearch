Yeah, like I said I haven't totally written that one off. 

I do wonder if maybe I'm generally more 'romantic' than 'sexual' since I know I like the idea of being in a relationship and the more emotional aspects more than the sexual ones. But then it could also be the 'I'm kind of lonely' kicking in

Yeah, because also when I was in school a lot of people there weren't very nice to me so whilst there were some people people crushed on for me it didn't work because 'How can you crush on them, they're mean!' but then when you get most of your class either picking on your or ignoring you that's bound to happen. (Like when someone started this thing of 'Don't go near her you'll get the lurgy!' to basically drive people away from me)
