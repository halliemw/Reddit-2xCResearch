Yeast infections can cause blistering and cracking of skin and severe dryness apparently. I recently had a yeast infection and it developed from a slight feeling of friction when I woke up on morning, to severe agony by 9pm. I was literally on my bed rolling around like I had ants in my pants and ready to burst into tears while my boyfriend made yeast jokes for like an hour. 

But anyway, I found a cold flannel and pressure helped with the urge to itch it. It didn't settle down until a few hours after I managed to get hold of yeast infection ointment though :( 

I hope you get whatever it is sorted really fast and easily though, it's really not a nice thing to have to go through.
