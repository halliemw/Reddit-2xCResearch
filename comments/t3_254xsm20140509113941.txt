I've been here for a year and a half. Honestly, I don't actually know. I have never paid attention to what happens when a subreddit gets defaulted. However, I want to be welcoming to the new people that are here. I want to wait and see what happens before I try to scare people away or complain too much. I want to go back to thought provoking content and not just all bodily functions. I don't want to purposefully scare people away I want to be welcoming.
