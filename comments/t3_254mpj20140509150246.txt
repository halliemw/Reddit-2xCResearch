I want to defend my father's honor: Some people just aren't good with blood, and there's no shame in that. He's a soft-spoken, unassuming accountant who needs to excuse himself from the room even for a blood sugar test (a dot of blood the size of a seed bead). I'm glad he didn't pass out and scald himself.
