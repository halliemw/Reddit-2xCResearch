The "cankles" thing really pisses me off. A few weeks ago there was a somewhat racist post involving the OP's female roommate and her date who happened to be eating fried chicken in bed. The girl in question had a really nice butt, which was basically all you could see in the picture other than her legs. This girl was NOT fat. Half the comments (the non-racist ones anyway) were about how nice this girl's ass was, but the other half were about the fact that she was a disgusting fat ass, as proven by her fat ankles!  Ugh!!!!
