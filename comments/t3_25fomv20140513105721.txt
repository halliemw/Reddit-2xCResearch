Honestly, if you get nervous just nod your head and smile and keep conversation flowing by asking neutral questions until he says something your interested in and you can find something in common with your interests to talk about. Once you guys are relaxed and talking the rest will flow easily.

It usually works out a little easier if you not hook up on the first date, just because you don't put pressure on the experience by investing in it.

Just think of it as fun. This doesn't have to be an interview, a life changing decision or an epic moment. Just let it be fun and it should really work out well, whether you two mesh or not.

Have some fun getting ready. Pick up a new accessory, get the old talons and hooves trimmed down. Be pretty by being yourself. But wear comfortable shoes and underwear and pee before you leave for your date. Nothing is more stressful than having to go but not wanting to tell your date to PULL OVER RIGHT NOW because you've got to take a pisser like a racehorse.
