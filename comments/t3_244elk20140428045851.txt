>  I've seen some people have casual sex and it's no big deal. I've seen others engage in casual sex and it fucks with them. Sex is complicated.

Right on.  I would like to see this message emphasised more.

Many of the young people I study with now are all falling over themselves to prove to themselves and others that they are 'totally fine with casual sex.'

The reality is - some are absolutely fine with it, and it works well for them.  Others are finding out it doesn't work for them, but unfortunately they (both young men and women) actually have to defend themselves in conversation for why they're not kicking a fresh conquest out of their dorm every weekend.

Some are getting quite upset when they 'fail to enjoy' casual sex.  They do not have 'emotional issues', or 'low self esteem', or 'unsatisfactory partners', or histories of sexual abuse (as important as those things are to consider).  Casual sex just doesn't do it for these people and they should have the social freedom to do their own thing, same as anyone enjoying a hook-up.
