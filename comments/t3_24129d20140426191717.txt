as far as I am aware, 99% of the time men don't develop symptoms of HPV. They carry it but many of them will never know they even have it. your current boyfriend probably even already had it before you guys hooked up, if he's had other girlfriends. but you'll never know if he does or not, because he's a dude. or so it was explained to me (I simplified it a bit) by the doctor.

HPV is nothing really to be worried about it. I tested positive for HPV last time I had a pap but the only physical sign to tip off the doctor was a tiny bump on my cervix. (I've had normal paps my whole life up until this point) the doctor said it was a low-risk strain, and that my body will fight it off naturally. there's nothing really that can be done about it. the vaccine only protects you from the handful of strains that can develop into cancer - most strains of HPV are just a lil virus that your body has to build up an immunity to. You may never know who you got it from, since it can apparently be dormant in your body for a long time before it "flares up". 

Don't feel bad about yourself. It's really not that big of a deal. I felt terrible about it at first too, but it's really, really not a huge problem.
