You trusted him and got screwed over because of it. People get constantly expect their SO to "just trust them" when situations like this arise and again and again we get shat on (in my personal experience). You have every right to be angry and you should be elated that that asshole is out of your life. In one way or another i've learned that when you expect a person of being sketchy, they are.... and if you forgive them, you're giving them the oppotunity to sort things out and get over you and move onto someone new while you're trying to make the relationship work. Maybe i've been burned too may times, I suppose I can only give this advice to make you aware of it. I always hold out hope and stick things out too even though I know of the reality of it all. My four year realtionship with one guy ended with the guy going on a date the very next day and engaged within a year to her so I feel you....

Best of luck dear!  *hugs* I know dem feels.
