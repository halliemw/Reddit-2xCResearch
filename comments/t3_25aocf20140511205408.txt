The rule of thumb for cups is that if you would have worn a pad/liner under your tampon, you should wear one under your cup.

Cut off the stem.  It doesn't do anything and you can't use it to pull on the cup.

You said "give them a go." I bet you're British.  There's a Mooncup and a Moon cup, the former being available in the UK and was prevented from being sold by the makers of latter cup in the US.  I'm American and got my UK mooncup a half-decade ago, before the ban happened.  The LJ community is probably still bitter about that one.  Hehe.  

Seriously, go find the mensrtual cup livejournal community.  They're huge.
