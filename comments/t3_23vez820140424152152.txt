[Misogyny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny) on the internet is alive and well and it is the primary reason I chose the username I did. My username connotes a male, from a male-dominated, non-Bechdel test passing movie. 

The men (and boys) who post blatantly sexist and sometimes hateful comments often find themselves in real life situations where they are at a disadvantage and they are bitter, bitter people. They have not checked their privilege. [Louis CK does a nice bit about how thoroughly good being a white male is today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4f9zR5yzY). They feel life is unfair to them and they see some women (and some minorities) as getting what they feel is an unfair advantage. 

People get angry and defensive when they feel something is being taken away from them. I wish the men (and boys) who feel like being Mr Macho on the internet would wake up and realize that they only feel as they do because they had an advantage in the first place.
