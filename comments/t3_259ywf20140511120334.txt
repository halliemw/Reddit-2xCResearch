That's an incredibly selfish attitude. I just can't imagine how someone could really feel this way. It is an imposition. If you aren't close enough to the bride that you KNOW you are invited to the wedding, you probably were not. Plans change. Just because someone isn't invited to the wedding now does not mean they were never intending on inviting that person.

As wedding days get closer, budgets become more real, and guest lists shrink. There is just no reason to question the bride directly. There are dozens of other people who can find out for her in a more discreet way without risking putting the bride in a bad position. Ask a friend to find out on her behalf, ask the brides family.

Asking the bride directly is just rude. There is no justification for it. She isn't close enough to the bride for that, or she wouldn't need an invitation in the first place.
