I think the girls who grow up faster do so not because they're intrinsically older in the brain, but because outside factors put them in situations that children shouldn't have to deal with. Like this 27-year-old dude. The problem is the mentality of "she was like that before he got there" versus "this is the kind of situation that messes a teenage girl up."
