I don't think the premises are insane at all.  I just disagree with the feminine thing.  He was just clean cut and probably looked younger than he was.  I don't see the feminine traits at all.  The first thought on my mind watching the video was how could an attractive guy like him who probably had no financial worries, end  up making a video about absolute loneliness.   His social skills must have just SCREAMED red flags all over the place.  That's the only explanation I find.
