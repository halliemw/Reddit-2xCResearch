PLEASE direct me to pictures of lady cyclists!  I'd love to show them off to my father.  

Thank you for the confirmation/support here.  I don't cycle often, but I'm planning to use my bike for rides of moderate difficulty for at least an hour or two a day. At any rate, even if my non-step through frame is harder to handle, I'm okay with that.
