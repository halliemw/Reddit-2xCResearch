A relevant interview I read lately with the writing staff of the show:

>In the Q & A, one of the first audience questions came from a woman who asked whether the show planned to feature any female engineers among its characters. It was clearly a query the show’s writers and cast were anticipating. (At SXSW, nearly every panel or Q & A I sat in on had some version of this question, including Mindy Kaling’s.) Miller tried to make a joke of it, mentioning how few women are present in the real life Silicon Valley, but it fell flat and sounded less like a bit than a defensive posture. It’s also not entirely accurate, as women comprised 50% of SXSW Interactive’s attendees this year. Judge answered more simply. “Yes. We’ve talked about it. We’re only two episodes in, give us a couple more.” Fair enough.

It sounds like they're aware of this as a problem and are 'working on it'. But as a lady in the tech industry, I have a problem with it too. I've been to Disrupt and the gender ratio is nowhere near as bad as portrayed.

Plus there is funny-ass shit that happens to you when you're a woman in tech. We have our own stereotypes to combat, challenges to face, and stories to tell.
