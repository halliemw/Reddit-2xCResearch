*hugs* You should talk to some of your friends, they may be more supportive than you think. I thought I was pregnant a few weeks ago and I wasn't planning on telling anyone about it. After I found out it was a false alarm, I told my best friend about it a few days after and she told me, "I would take you. I wouldn't let you go through that alone." Good luck though and we're all here if you need us!
