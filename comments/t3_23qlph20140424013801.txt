Birth control for seven years makes me shudder. 

I have to ask if you know what birth control does, what it has proven to do to women who have been on it for long periods of time? Taking a hormone in pill form just makes me cringe. 

That and the fact I turned into a terrible terror (throwing things of a ladder and literally at people, anyone?) on the pill itself.
