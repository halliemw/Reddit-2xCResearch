I feel very welcome in the subreddit and the people that frequent it, but the name does bug me, from a lot to a little, depending on how I'm feeling.  I've read the reasons for why it was named that (like from /u/satanslandlady's link), and I almost want to get behind it since I'm a huge geek.  But it's inherently non-inclusive, and doesn't even reflect modern science by saying that all women have exactly two X chromosomes.  

Every time I click on the name to go to this subreddit I'm reminded that I'm likely different by some arbitrary measure.  It especially bugs me because many people use their idea of our chromosome count as an arbitrary line in the sand to declare us as still our assigned sex, despite usually not even knowing if their own chromosome count lines up with their gender, let alone ours.  This just feels like more of that.

So I appreciate the intention behind the name (yay, geeky and girly!), but the name chosen to express that intent could have been a LOT better.  When translating the word woman into science speak, make sure that it doesn't leave some portion of women in the dust.
