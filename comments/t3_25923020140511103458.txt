Exactly! People get so caught up in how they are supposed to appear that they completely miss the reasons behind whatever they're doing. I talk to people on the depression subreddit who think their lives are shit because they took a year longer to finish college or whatever.

People put effort into giving the appearance of apathy. Being "cool" or "aloof" as opposed to being a "try-hard". That just blows my mind.

If you want to give a shit about something, go for it. If you don't, don't. If someone makes fun of you for not wearing the coolest clothes, it rolls right off, unless you care about wearing the coolest clothes. And the beauty of life, I think, is that each of us can decide what is important, and what is not.

For me, it took mental illness, drug abuse, and multiple hospitalizations to figure this out. Some people never do.
