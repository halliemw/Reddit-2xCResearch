This is a great and informative article, but a bit of a problem I have is that a lot of these articles completely downplay the hymen. For a lot of girls, including me, it very much exists and it was extremely painful to break. I could only wear certain brands of tampons depending on the few millimeter differences in diameter. It took a week and a half of stretching every night just to get anything past it, and another week to keep it stretched enough to use larger sized tampons, let alone have sex. I'm also sure it wasn't vaginismus or the like, since everything was prepared and it was definitely the hymen I was pressing against.
