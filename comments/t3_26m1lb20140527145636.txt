>No, it's more like "Not all cops are trying to ticket/imprison you for profit, but all minorities have to navigate a world where those who are look the same as those who don't."
You have failed to understand that men still have the upper hand in society and that there is a physical power difference. So in your example, if the black men were given more credibilty than whites and if they were physically bigger and stronger than whites on average, then you'd have a point.
