I love a **lot** of the suggestions here especially /u/meantforamazing. I have struggled a LOT with jealousy and it's a really shitty feeling. 
However, I would like to say that even when you don't trust your SO 100% I still think it's best to just let it go. 

If it's something you're really concerned about, I would talk to them about it, one time, if your relationship is that kind of relationship. If not, let it go. 

It sounds stupid to just say that, but in my experience it's what works. If you give into the jealousy and even start blaming your SO for doing things that make you jealous it just makes someone look like a crazy biatch. 

Stressing about it won't help you any. Don't try to control the person so you don't become a 'crazy girl'. However, the second you find out they did something to violate your trust, dump their ass and never look back. Don't argue with them, dont sink down to their level, just leave.
