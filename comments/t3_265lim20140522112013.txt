nope if the guy is autistic he won't just assume he has permission to have sex with her. she had to very clearly communicate that she wanted to have sex before he would be agreeable to it (and even then some autistic people just don't want to have sex under any condition). so now if she fails to say no then she raped him, because he is cognitively challenged, and she is taking advantage of him. her being unaware of this does not excuse the fact that she raped him.
