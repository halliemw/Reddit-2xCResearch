I had a semi-private bathroom in my dorm.  It was me and two other girls.  I cleaned it weekly and they STILL hover peed.  Like, what the fuck, it's our private bathroom.  No one but me, you, and any of our guests pee in here.  If you're concerned about the cleanliness, you could maybe clean the bathroom every once in a while.  (It would be a cold day in hell...)

That wasn't the worst though.  One of their favorite boy toys was convinced he was constantly in a literal pissing contest and somehow ended up peeing all over the floor EVERY TIME.  You think stepping in regular water puddles in your socks is bad?  Ugh.  I'm glad I learned that one quickly enough.

Gross, gross, gross.
