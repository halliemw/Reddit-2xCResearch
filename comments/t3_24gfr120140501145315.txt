To find "why did the chicken cross the road?" funny, you have to share the teller's assumption of a set of reasonable reasons a chicken would cross the road, and everything else is outside that set. Then, further, you have to share a cultural context, where jokes are expected to be unexpected. It's not a good example of a joke, because it's sort of a meta-joke... a commentary on conventional punchlines.

If you told this joke to someone who either had no experience with conventional English-language humor (or similar forms), or who had only the vaguest notion of what either a chicken or a road was, they wouldn't find it funny. They wouldn't find it *offensive* either, probably; the notion that ambulatory flightless domesticated birds might find occasion to change which side of the throughway they are on isn't, after all, offensive to most people. (Possibly it is to some birds, but squawk squawk squawk).

Here's another one for you: "Why did the turtle cross the road? To get to the Shell station." Finding this joke funny requires that you are aware that there's a brand of gasoline called Shell, sold in stations, as well as that turtles are an animal which has a shell. (It also helps if you're familiar with the chicken joke, but it's not strictly required... this is a pun that can stand on its own.) Without either of those pieces of shared knowledge, the joke falls flat.

The assumption of shared bigotry works in a very similar way as these much more basic examples of shared knowledge. Thank you for illustrating the point precisely.
