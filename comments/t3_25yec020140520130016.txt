Oh my. Where to start? Hmmm…..ok, let’s start here:

You are not ready for the real world.

As a waypoint, let’s just establish one thing up front: in the real world, nobody gives a rat’s ass about your “20 page research paper”. No offense. It’s not personal. It’s also not a function of the subject matter or anything else. It’s just not relevant to anything in the real world. Seriously. I had to write a 50 page (or was it 75?) paper for the “writing requirement” for my JD. (Yes, I can hear all you people with real graduate degrees snickering.) Never, not once in the 30 years since I graduated has anybody, ever, in any context, asked me what it was about. It’s just not worth even a warm bucket of piss. Nobody cares.

So she was clearly just trying to make polite conversation. However, putting that aside, a grown, mature person would have realized that when this woman, with whom you apparently have no real connection, was trying to find a common ground upon which you two might have a conversation. Another way to put this is that she was trying to be nice and pleasant. And instead you choose to engage directly and confrontationally. That will teach her!

That’s a perfectly good way to get people to leave you alone. Maybe not such a bad thing at your shindig to celebrate your graduation. But it’s going to be a long haul in life if you choose to redress everyone you meet who commits some kind of “ism” faux paus in your presence about which you feel strongly. You need to learn to control that before you wind up old, miserable, and alone.

And this will particularly short circuit any effort you make at a career. Your lack of self-awareness and social propriety isn’t going do you any favors in the working world.

I won’t go into how the title of your post screams ageism, or how these things play out in the real world. All I know is that you aren’t ready for it.
