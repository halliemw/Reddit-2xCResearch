>One thing I forgot to mention is that, at a young age, my husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

This is an enormously important clue to what is happening here. I think you need to suggest to him that it's returned and that he needs help. At this point, you have very little to lose.

If you don't want to be that confrontational, you can suggest marriage counseling and speak with your marriage counselor about your concerns ahead of time.
