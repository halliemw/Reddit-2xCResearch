I've been using a mooncup since I was 16 and for me it really is all that. :)  

There is a learning curve to it, such as inserting it and figuring out a fold that works for you, getting the stem to comfortable length, learning to remove it without spilling it and so on. Once you get all that down pat it's really a brilliant thing!
