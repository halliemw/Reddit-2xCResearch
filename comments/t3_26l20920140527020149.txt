Originally I didnt want to post this for fear of people either thinking I'm a troll or not believing me, but I'm actually a guy and my friend is a female. I'm afraid of telling people because Im not sure that ill be believed or made fun of. I'm a bigger guy and it wouldnt have been a problem pushing her off if i had been sober but i was to groggy at the time. Ive already told one close friend and was laughed at because they said it wasnt possible and I must of liked it which was really disheartening and im just not really sure what to do from here =/
