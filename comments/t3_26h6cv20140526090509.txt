Probably true.  Now I just have to work up the nerve to ask her because I'm worried that she will react in the same harsh/nasty way she's been acting, or tell me I'm "too sensitive" or some such.  Which I guess is not really a reason to stay quiet, since right now I feel like cutting her out of my life, and at least if I ask her and she is crappy about it then I will know I tried.  Maybe she will surprise me by reacting well.
