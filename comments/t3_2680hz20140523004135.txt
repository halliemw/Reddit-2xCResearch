I've been able to do this with people who are my friends originally (date a bit and it doesn't work out, the feeling after are rough but true friends work through it) but not strangers I'm seeking to pick up as a date or vice versa. The intent of the guys hitting on you is to find a girlfriend/ and or lover not a friend. These are to me completely different roles with different boundaries and social protocols. When I was younger I had terrible boundaries and social skills which lead to a lot of drama and frustration. I'm not perfect now but I try to be clear in my relationships with males and females. I don't seek out friends by hitting on them first or expect a friendship to bloom where romantic intent was originally. 

 For me personally I would not want to be friends with the folks in your situation or continue the contact because I already know what they are looking for. I don't think my SO [we are in a mono relationship] would be cool with me  'starting a friendship' with someone who asked me out.
