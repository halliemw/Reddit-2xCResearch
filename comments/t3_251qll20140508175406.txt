I'm curious in what contexts this happens? I'm totally open to the idea that it happens and I just haven't noticed -- it would make sense that, as a feminist, I wouldn't necessarily be as aware of that happening. I'm just kinda surprised to hear that it happens. I know that certain opinions are basically not tolerated here, but to me it's more hardline antifeminist stuff, like being against legal abortion, or pro-Red Pill or something. Otherwise I feel that I usually see some discussion and (mostly) respectful disagreement within the comments.
