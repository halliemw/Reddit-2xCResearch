So when some girls in our dorm burned popcorn and set the fire alarm off at like 2 am in the middle of finals week there were lots of annoyed people but we got over it. The majority of people didn't even know it was them.   They did feel bad and write an apology (that's how I know it was was them) 

Maybe bake some cookies and hang them on doorknobs if it makes you feel better?  Doing something to apologize to that lady who knocked for sure
