A little bit at a time. This is a long game you're playing. It's important to understand that so that if you hit a bump in the road you can remember that it's just one blip on your journey.

Pick one good habit to start with. Maybe it's a daily walk. Maybe it's cutting out soda. Commit to doing it every day and reward yourself (non-food of course) when you do it.

See your doctor and ask for guidance and resources.
