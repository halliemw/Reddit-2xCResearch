I think the worst part is when talking about a group that varies with age. I don't think separating "girls" "young women" and "women" is too difficult, but when talking about a group it becomes difficult.

Males ranging from 15 to 40 can all be called "guys".

Females ranging from 15 to 50 can't all be grouped into any one term.
