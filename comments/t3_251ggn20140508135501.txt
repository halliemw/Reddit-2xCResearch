Actually, what that article boils down to is that, while the particular study being used seems limited in scope, it meshes pretty well on most measures with several other studies that look at larger and more diverse populations. So while the 1 in 5 number isn't validated by other research, the other results are, which lends it credibility. Not so much that the number is *wrong* or inflated, but that it's promising and more study is needed to confirm it.
