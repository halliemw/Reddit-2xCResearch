Do you think it would help you to take some time off of school? We tend to get really stuck on the idea that you have to finish school in a certain number of years, and that if you don't, you're a failure who will be living in your parents' basement forever. But I know quite a few people who took a break from college (between 1 and 3 semesters) who are now back and seem much happier and better equipped to handle college than they were before. There's a stereotype of the kid who "takes a semester off" and just never goes back, but plenty of people do go back, and when they do, they often do quite well. If you're truly passionate about social work, I believe that some time soon, you will find the drive to complete school.

Obviously this isn't a solution that works for everyone, but I do sincerely believe that it's the best option for some people and I wasn't sure anyone else would suggest it. If the idea of taking a break from school really bothers you for reasons beyond social stigma, then that's fine and you can totally ignore this advice. I just wanted to make sure you knew that it's a reasonable and often responsible choice to make.
