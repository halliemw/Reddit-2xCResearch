No we don't. When feminists propose such ideas (the atlantic is a left leaning publication) they are signalling to the world that women are weak. That we need special treatment and rights because we are like little children. The only thing that we as a society should do is increase the number of sick days allowed such that if someone is having really bad cramps they can take a sick day to get over them. Men and women would both have this increase of sick days thus not giving preferential treatment to either gender/sex. Egalitarianism, not bigoted feminism and their I want special privileges that exclude men, should be the objective.
