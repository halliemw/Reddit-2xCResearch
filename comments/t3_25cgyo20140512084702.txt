I think it's several things, one is the jobs lifestyle. You have to work for years and years 60, 80+ hour weeks. Many women want kids and my guess is they just generally get diverted off the elite chef career path. 

Another is the old sexist idea that women can't handle as hard/stressful tasks as men. 

And then there's the fact that their are fewer female elite chefs, which brings the perception that there must be some gender difference at play and leaves women with more of an uphill climb.
