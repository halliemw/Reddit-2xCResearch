I don't doubt that parts of Elliot's worldview are reflected in the culture at large...but that's not the claim that Arthur Chu makes. He says that, except for the part about mass murder, Elliot is perfectly 'normal' for an angry geek guy. If true, that's amazingly disturbing, because Elliot was a raging lunatic long before he graduated to murder.

Note that I'm not contesting Chu's claim. I'm old...I don't really hang out with that demographic anymore, so I honestly wouldn't know. I've had several people who's judgment I generally trust tell me that there is something different about the Millennial Male - a sense of entitlement and rage that didn't exist when they were kids. (it's worth noting, though, that most of the people I know who say things like that are also getting old) Maybe Elliot (minus the mass murder) really is the face of the new generation. I sure hope not, though.
