You don't choose who you are attracted to, and from what you have posted it is clear that you are attracted to him. If you want to have a "friends with benefits" relationship with your friend's younger brother, why not tell him this? There is no reason that you should feel that you cannot set boundaries on your partner in a relationship, and there is nothing wrong with wanting sexual intimacy without emotional intimacy.  
Also, I don't feel that you need your friend's "blessing" to pursue the type of relationship you want, but if you have reason to believe that your friendship would be compromised (and you value the friendship more than a potential FWB relationship), why not talk to your friend? I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to explain that you respect the decisions your friend has made about how to use her body, while asking that she respect your decision about how to use your body. Friends are people who support each other's decisions, not agree on each and every one of them.  
Whatever you decide to do, I wish you the best of luck!
