It could be due to a number of things but without knowing you personally all i can do is hazard a guess, feel free to read the following but don't take it personally or literally, for a diagnosis you really need to see a professional.


You could be bi-polar, the bursts of emotion representing the "Manic" phase that contrasts to your depression episodes.

You could be suffering from Boarderline Personality Disorder, though the symptoms for that are many and varied, one is manifesting *extremes* of emotions rather then more manageable moderate levels.

It could also be due to a hormonal imbalance from the use of chemical contraceptives. If you don't use chemical contraceptives then it may be worth considering starting a course to see if they stabilize your moods, though this should be done with caution as they can make you worse.

There may be others but those three are the most likely i can think of, i hope it helps, again, this isn't a diagnosis or a excuse for you to self-diagnose, for a solid judgment you need to see a doctor or a psychiatrist.
