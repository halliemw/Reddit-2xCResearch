An ad hominem fallacy is the claim that an argument a person makes is invalid in virtue of who they are. For example the claim that an argument about the rightness or wrongness of killing is invalid because the author making it is a murderer.

Here the implicit claim by those deploying mansplaining (when not used in its coined sense) is that the argument in favour of a position about a woman's issue is invalid in virtue of the author being a man.
