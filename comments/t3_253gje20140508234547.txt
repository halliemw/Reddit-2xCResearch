But it is *normalized* for women.

Quick questions:

When you were pre-pubsecent (let's say ... before 14 years of age) did anyone make remarks about your sexual characteristics (your ass, your pecs/boobs, your genitals)?

Because if you are a woman, your answer is probably going to be "yes, multiple times".

Have you ever been hollered at on the street in a sexual way?

Compared to a woman, men experience this much less.

Have you ever been touched without your consent by a stranger/someone who is not even an acquaintance in a sexual way?

If you are a woman, you are more likely to say yes.

(Although increasingly women are touching men sexually in a non-consensual way - grabbing his crotch, grabbing his nipple, and that is not okay! But it still isn't as pervasive - I doubt many men can say a total stranger has ever "caressed" his asshole while he's bending over, but TWO of my female friends have had creeps do a "caress" from their genitals and up their ass).

That is normalisation.
