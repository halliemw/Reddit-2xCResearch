Your body shape/size and sexual lifestyle aren't something I'm judging over, but if you post half a story it changes the answers you're going to get. 

I looked because I wanted some context for "man friend"; potentially an explanation for his behaviour (it's a strange term to me). Your history seemed odd put together with this story and clarification never hurt anyone.

Going back to the question, what you do with your body and your social company is up to you - it really boils down to: 

i) "man friend" having jealousy issues, maybe wanting more than what he has/to keep you to himself (exclusivity).

ii) whether you think you can either a) accept these issues, b) work through them together, or c) find them to be a kind of "deal breaker"

He's not necessarily wrong and neither are you, you just have different expectations/boundaries. If you can talk it out, that's great... but if you can't compromise on them within the parameters of whatever relationship type you're looking to have (hopefully you both want the same thing), then it's probably better to find someone else with expectations/boundaries similar to your own.
