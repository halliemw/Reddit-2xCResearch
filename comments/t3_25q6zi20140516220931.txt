This is such a happy photo. I'm the youngest of three girls myself and in 2012, our oldest sister passed away on her 30th birthday. As happy as I am to see there sisters looking so wonderful and beautiful, beaming with pride, I am sad that I won't have my big sister with me to recreate something like this. I don't mean to be a mood killer, just... Be thankful for each other and treasure every moment. Things like this are such a gift.
