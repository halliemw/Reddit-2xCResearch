no they said it was not literature because of the difficulty of reading the sexually violent scenes which is a bullshit opinion. read the bluest eye by Toni Morrison for example - filled with difficult to read scenes involving sexual violence but a great piece of literature probably in part because of those scenes. OP was saying literature involving these themes is not literature but a shitty product of rape culture; the implication being that it is uneeded and should stop when this view is in fact anti-free speech and wholly ignorant of literature as a concept

edit: also as far as the rape goes I'm undecided as was much if this subbreddit a few weeks ago when the issue was discussed. in the tv series for sure rape but in the novel seriously debatable

edit: and I haven't actually read the 5th book yet so please no more spoilers
