I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that most illnesses are caused by lifestyle choices, and I think it's seriously bigoted and unempathetic to think that it's ok for people to die because they don't have enough money. What about people with cystic fibrosis? Type 1 diabetes? They sure as hell didn't ask for those illnesses, but they should just die if something goes wrong and they're underinsured or uninsured because fuck the entry-level job market right now? I can respect certain viewpoints that I don't agree with, but I will never be able to respect the idea that your income level should directly determine whether you live or die. Maybe it's because I knew a girl in high school who died of pneumonia because her family lost their insurance and couldn't afford a doctor, and by the time they got to the ER it was too late. Fuck people who think 14 year olds with asthma should die because their parents aren't rich enough.

And to be fair, I didn't downvote your first comment that you're complaining about having been downvoted, but I did downvote this bigoted comment.
