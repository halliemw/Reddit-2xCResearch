>There are plenty of sexist women who see women as inferior or subservient to men, and men and women who see men as inferior or worse than women.

I think we can go even further and distinguish sexist behaviour from a sexist mentality. There are plenty of both men and women who say or do sexist things, but would never consciously condone sexism.

I don't think there's a person anywhere who hasn't done something sexist at one point or another. I'd even go so far as to say that most of us have probably even done something recently.
