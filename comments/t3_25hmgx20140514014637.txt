Uh, is absolutely would be sexist if a female professor said that. Men aren't constantly horny and violent, and if I was a guy and a professor told me that I was, I would definitely be offended. I wouldn't want a professor who often implied that because of my gender I was crazy, shallow and lying about being in pain, because there are tons of people who actually *believe* these things about women, and to them it's only confirmed when they hear jokes like this all the time. I would also feel like I was less valued as a student than the male ones and that I wouldn't be taken seriously due to my "being crazy".
