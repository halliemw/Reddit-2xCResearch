I generally try to give people the benefit of the doubt and so I don't know whether this really falls under "mansplaining" or not, but it happens all the time and it always, always is from guys (usually older men). My last name is a relatively uncommon term. Fairly frequently after learning it a man will ask me, with a condescending tone, if I know what it means. To be polite I just smile and inform him that yes, in fact I do, but to be honest it's super annoying that they assume they are going to teach me the meaning of my own name when they've only just learned it and I've been living with it my whole life.
