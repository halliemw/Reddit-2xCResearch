I hover occasionally in the game of thrones subreddit. Sadly there's a lot of sexist views and behaviors lurking around those parts. Not the majority of course, but every now and then you'll have Cersei being used as a straw man feminist, or Daenerys being labelled as "mad Queen". Little snide comments or pictures depicting things that really aren't going on in the show or books. 
They tend to be the type that glorifies Stannis ala "Stannis the Mannis". Strange that they tend to rally around effectively the only king who is a straight white male in his 30's. 

What I'm getting at, is that for me GRRM writes string female characters. He gives them life and personality, and he sees that strength can be a mother's love or strength in combat or intelligence or leadership potential. Or combinations of them all. He writes strong female characters and weak female characters and strong men and weak men. And that's what makes his story awesome
