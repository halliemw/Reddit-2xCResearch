Yep! Any gunk can be removed with a bit of work, and they can be sanitized with rubbing alcohol. Agreed on cheap brushes, but quality brushes can cost $50 or more a piece, so it's best to take care of them. Frequent cleaning will extend the life of the brush, make for better application, and help control breakouts.
