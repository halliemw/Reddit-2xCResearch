I would love to hear you kick up a fuss about this...in a PTA meeting, or a letter to the local paper, or otherwise. Write down the things she said in her speech, and then step-by-step refute the most egregious parts (disdainment of birth control, misleading figures, sexist concepts). Explain exactly how damaging people like that women are: They spread misinformation, they convince students that their self-worth is predicated on their sexuality, they make students who are or have been sexually active feel used and worthless. Cite studies that have shown that abstinence-only students do not defer sex any later than comprehensive sex-ed students, but DO have higher rates of teen pregnancy and STDs. Cite people like Elizabeth Smart, who has written and spoken extensively of how anti-sex rhetoric caused her to not seek help after she was kidnapped and raped (she thought after they raped her that no one would want her anymore, precisely because of rhetoric like the "duct tape" demonstration).

I remember getting the duct tape demonstration in school and I am so angry in hindsight that I wasn't smart enough to articulate what was wrong with it. Imagine being a kid who has been sexually abused at home, and now you go to school and some snotty woman is comparing you to USED TAPE or a freaking licked cupcake.  

People need to wake up to how truly damaging the content of these lectures are. It sickens me that educators would let people enter their school and spew this fucking nonsense.
