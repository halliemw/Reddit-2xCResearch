I understand what you mean. Hannah's not a positive icon generally, let alone 'body positive.' She IS selfish and arrogant, and the fact that she doesn't care much about her appearance is evidence (among other evidence) of this... not because appearance SHOULD be of utmost importance to anyone... it's not a value-statement that you're making. Philosophically speaking, though, she isn't practicing self-care, and she doesn't have much regard for the social society that she's part of.
