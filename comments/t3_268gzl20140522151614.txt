I had the Mirena for over five years (on my second), and have never experienced any of the side effects mentioned, but I no longer bleed. There will be occasional blood after sex, but that could be just from bumping my cervix.  I've been very happy with this for me of birth control.  I user to use the pill and had a hard time taking the pills consistently. 

Edit: mobile phones
