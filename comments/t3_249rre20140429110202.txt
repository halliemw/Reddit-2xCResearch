Phew. Good thing my father was raised normal and so was I. I suffered with shame for my sexuality for years (from peer pressure, church, and media) - since only a year ago (am 20) I embraced my womanhood and Wicca and Buddhism. Not trying to push into a religious talk, just saying I feel more relaxed and I don't worry or feel ashamed because of my body and natural desires.
