You're not alone. I've heard other people and I'm sure I've been heard myself. Try not to be embarrassed. If you like it, and your boyfriend likes it there is nothing wrong with letting loose.

That being said, now that you know other people can hear you try and be strategically considerate. For example, if it is late at night or a time that you know other people are likely to be in their apartment or would be more likely to be bothered by extra noise, try and tone it back a bit. 

It kind of adds to the fun sometimes by trying to hold yourself back. I've had contests to see which one of us (my SO or I) could keep quietest the longest. Obviously we were each trying our hardest to make the other one make noise ;)
