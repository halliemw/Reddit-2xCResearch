This probably isn't the story you're looking for, but I *sort of* proposed to my partner, in that I was the first one to say, "hey, we should get married." We subsequently spent about 2 years on and off debating the matter, until one day it came up and I exasperatedly said, "oh, just forget the whole thing, I don't care that much!" and he was like, "no, I'm ready, let's get married." Then we did.

But there was no formal question, no exchange of jewellery, no kneeling.
