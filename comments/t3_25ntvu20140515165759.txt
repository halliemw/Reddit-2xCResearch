I step away from the internet and spend time with my friends, who I have carefully chosen to *not* be sexist fuckwads, doing things I enjoy. People suck and sexism is everywhere, but that doesn't mean that fun people and activities don't exist. It's better when you limit your time around the internet and shitty people.
