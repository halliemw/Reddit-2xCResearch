Not sure why you're being so condescending, I am perfectly aware of how gestation works, I was merely using to word baby in place of fetus, not that it was a child already. And he is allowed whatever opinion he wants. Just because it is her decision doesn't mean he doesn't get to have feelings about it. Two people created the fetus/embryo/unborn child and if it came to term two people would be legally obligated to contribute to its raising. I don't see why he can't want to be a father.
