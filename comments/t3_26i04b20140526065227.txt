I would go about writing down every detail you still remember.

* the date of the crime (even if it's approximately)  
* how it progressed (what he first did and what you then did) 
* what you did in reaction (how you said "no", how you beat his chest etc.)  
* the injuries you had (internal bleeding of the vagina, write down every bruise you remember, every scratch)  
* remember and write down the names of the people/friends you told about the crime so they can maybe retell their story on how you confined in them back then

Once you have such a document (take your time, write it over the course of several days) contact those advocacy groups that people are posting here and ask for help.

But have such a document! It will help you with reminding you that it was *real* and really did *happen*.
