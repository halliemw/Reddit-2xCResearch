If we want a space where men can give their input on any issue ever, we can go to the rest of reddit. even /r/feminism is a place where we can do that. There are very few spaces on this site where we could talk about things from a woman's perspective. Is it really so much to ask that if someone cannot be respectful of this, that they just not talk?

Will you EXPLODE if you just can not get those words out? Come on, if you are a man who thinks you're entitled to put your opinion into every conversation about women? You're the problem.
