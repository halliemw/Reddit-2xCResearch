Darlin, they're going to say dumb bullshit no matter what you wear.  You did nothing to deserve it -- not even dressing in short shorts.  Shit, I was wearing a knee-length pencil skirt and professional blouse while walking to the courthouse with another attorney and a man decided to yell at me that I was a slut and shouldn't walk around dressed like that.

It's not you, it's them.  Wear your short shorts like the completely awesome and radical lady you are.
