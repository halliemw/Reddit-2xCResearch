I am _ but I was married briefly to the dad. My decision to end it - with a 3 yr old and a 14 month old.   Everyone thought I was crazy.   I love my life _ by the way,  I have raised them to young adults on my own, and my life has been rich and exciting and spontaneous, along with all the stable elements necessary to raise happy, well adjusted healthy kids.  They are fun and smart and grounded, with good manners but a wicked sense of humour, redditors with their own awesome lives....I have had some amazing relationships - two that came close to marriage, but I didn't want that....they are still very close friends however.  My love and sex life was good - some times were lonely, I will admit, but my married sisters tell me they get lonely in their relationships as well - so take it for what it is.     It was rewarding, fun, harder than you could ever imagine at times, and easier at times than other mums I know, and the single best decision I ever made.  I love my little statistically incorrect family and we are soooo happy.   I have zero regrets and think my little family is fantastic!
