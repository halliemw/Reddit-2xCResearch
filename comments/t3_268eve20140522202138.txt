wow, judgemental are we? Were you there? Sounds like he had no idea what was happening to her any more than she knew what was happening to herself. I've taken these drugs too and believe me, you don't feel weird at the time and people who know you can't really tell the difference. The only way you know something wasn't right is the next day. I think a more fair way for her to approach it is to just speak her mind. Why must fault be a part of it?
