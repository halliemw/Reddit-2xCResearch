This is absolutely not something I would advise someone to do at home, but my sister removed her IUD (it was giving her the most horrifying cramps, months after insertion) herself a few years ago, just by pulling the string.  Apparently it was totally uneventful.

Still not something I'd be comfortable doing myself, but at least personally that would put my mind at ease about the prospect of removal-related pain.
