Duuuude. I have friends in Bay street firms of 200+ people (sorry toronto, those are where our big corporate and litig firms are) and they don't get treated like shit or yelled at. I work for really successful lawyers and no one here gets yelled it. It's not the "norm" at all actually. Sketchy fucking personal injury/insurance/RL/family law firms run by one or two people who are constantly firing and rehiring is alwaaaays a red flag. ALWAYS. Come on.
