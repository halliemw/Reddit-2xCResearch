I got my ears pierced when I was about 8, and they got horribly infected and irritated because of a nickel allergy. Took 'em out, haven't really looked back. 

I've considered getting them re-pierced and being mindful of the metals and nickel-free earrings, but the process, cleaning, and healing just seems too annoying to me now.
