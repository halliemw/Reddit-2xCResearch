To be honest, it's not really suited for this subreddit because it's not really a thread focused on women's perspectives, but rather on how a guy can be a better guy. It's good that we're helpful, but we shouldn't have to put up with it constantly when specific places like /r/socialjustice101 exist for that very purpose and I imagine the sudden influx of "what is feminism? Why do you women even need this place? Educate me! Spoon feed me!" threads is getting on people's nerves.
