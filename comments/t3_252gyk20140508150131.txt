I've actually sat on a grand jury, so I didn't have to testify, but I saw some terrified people testifying. 

1. It's totally okay to say that you don't remember something or don't know something. 

2. It's okay to ask the attorney to clarify -- sometimes they have no idea what they're doing.

3. I don't know Oregon laws, but you might not be able to bring your phone, liquids, or other things into the court house.

4. Speak loudly -- the court reporter needs to hear you, as well as the jurors in the back.

Good luck -- just answer the questions the best you can and stick to what you know for sure!
