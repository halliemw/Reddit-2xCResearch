You say you feel confident inside but something about your presentation of yourself isn't transmitting that confidence to others -- so what about taking up an activity that focuses on your presentation? I've just joined Toastmasters, a well-regarded public speaking group, and it's pretty much all about learning to speak and present yourself confidently and clearly. Dues depend on your club but are maybe $30-50 for six months. It's just a suggestion, but it might help you a lot -- they're usually pretty experienced in critiquing *specific* behaviors you can change to both feel and appear more confident.

Edit: also, I like gladdit's response -- you don't have to change your entire style of interpersonal interaction, just learn to tweak how it comes across to others. If you're more of a listener, be more of a listener; be a leader that supports her team and integrates team ideas. Just tweak how you present yourself so that when you're making the final decision, ain't no one gonna mistake you.
