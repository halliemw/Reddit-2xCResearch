Thank you! I did end up ordering the small size! After a while I can't feel the tampon. When I first put one in I feel really dry. I'm assuming the Diva Cup will feel different. I don't think it'll get here for this cycle but I'll try to update and let you guys how it goes. Just give me like 32-45 days (I have the most unpredictable period.)
