That sucks. First times are hardly ever that fun. 

Have you ever had anything inserted inside you before? Tampons? Fingers? 

If your vagina isn't used to having anything inside it then inserting something the size of a penis would take a lot of time, patience, foreplay and lube. 

Sex isn't supposed to hurt. Take it slow. If it takes a few tries until you can do it comfortably then do so. This isn't something you should rush.
