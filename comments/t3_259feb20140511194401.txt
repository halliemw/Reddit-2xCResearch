Take any one topic (woodworking, owning a chinchilla, cycling to work... seriously, pick ANYTHING) and go and trawl the internet for info on it. You'll find out that it's difficult, time consuming and immensely complicated. Go out into the real world and do it, however, and it's really not that bad. Being a woman is exactly the same. You would be forgiven for thinking here that everything about being a woman is hard, and that it is often bad. That's because the internet is where people come to vent; if I write a post now about how my day was distinctly average, there won't be an awful lot of interest in it.
FWIW, I can't remember the last time I was heckled in the street (draw your own conclusions from that!), my partner and colleagues are nothing but respectful to me, and I'm absolutely cool with how my lady parts look. Yes, I have insecurities, and yes, I have problems, but without knowing you, sir, I'd guess you do to!
In terms of helping you understand, I think I can attribute my relatively sunny attitude about this stuff to my parents, for staying happily in the middle. They taught me I could do and be whatever I wanted (training to do my dream job now!), but also didn't emphasise that this was DESPITE MY BEING A WOMAN and that I'm EMPOWERED and STRONG etc etc, they just made sure that it never occurred to me that I couldn't do whatever made me happy in life. 
That you're concerned about this stuff suggests that you're a pretty awesome daddy. Just relax, you're doing great. I work with 5 year olds, and they're just fantastic. Enjoy it while she's this age, it's wonderful :)
