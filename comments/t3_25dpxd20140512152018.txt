I know just how you feel! I got my copper IUD about 2 years ago, have never (and hopefully will never) had kids. 
For me it felt like a very severe cramping, it was a lot like the cramps I get during my period, but 10000 times worse. I actually audibly yowled when it was inserted. I wasn't prescribed any pain meds. I don't know if I would've taken them anyway since I stayed in bed the rest of the day. My boyfriend came home with chicken wings and beer and that was the best possible remedy for me!
