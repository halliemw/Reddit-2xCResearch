Well, it does qualify as sexual harassment. So... you're wrong. Anything that says or implies it is not sexual harassment is wrong. End of story. There is nothing else to be discussed.  
  
If I told every dude in the office they were cock suckers it would be sexual harassment too. It doesn't have to be targeted to one person. If you are having difficulty grasping what falls under sexual harassment, a book or even an employee manual (assuming you have a job) will tell you immediately. No need to argue about something you don't understand.
