I can *maybe* understand mistaking someone's silence (or not even addressing what he's doing) as giving the ok sign, in this situation.  But this guy had met my boyfriend before he's met me, and knew we were dating.  And that we were walking just behind him.  I might go to future events, but not interact with this guy.  There are just enough people that attend that I may be able to do that.
