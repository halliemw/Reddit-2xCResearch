Thank you. :) In my thank you notes, I did let them know that I was nervous because the interview meant a great deal to me, but that I was still confident that I could do the job. I totally had diarrhea of the mouth on a couple questions and by the time I stopped talking, my answer was embarrassingly off-base and not at all like what I had been trying to say. Live and learn (and learn, and learn....)
