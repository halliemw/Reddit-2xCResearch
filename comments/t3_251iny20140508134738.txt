To me, it wasn't clear that the guy was going on Snapchat just to form connections with people for the sake of flirtatious attention. I have friends on Snapchat I've never met. Fuck, I snapchat with [warlizard](http://www.reddit.com/user/Warlizard). You know, very popular user here? Warlizard gaming forums? 

I certainly don't do it to flirt with them or to get their attention. I wouldn't consider it a problematic behavior and if my S/O had a problem with me snapchatting guys or talking to guys, you're right, I wouldn't be able to understand it. 

However, I read through the original post TWICE and I couldn't be sure if the base of the OP's problems really was just "talking to girls [online]" or if it was that he had encouraged the snapchat girl. It's obvious from the post that the girl the guy was snapchatting formed a crush on him. I'll certainly give you that. 

I needed more information because I think it would be crazy to just not be OK with your s/o talking to people of the other sex, but (unlike the trolls that are downvoted at the bottom) I was pretty sure OP wasn't crazy and I wanted to clarify because I wanted to believe she really meant something more than what *I* was able to read from her post. 

I'm sorry that you found my attempt to get more information from the OP because I *wanted to believe her side of the story* "a waste of everyone's time."
