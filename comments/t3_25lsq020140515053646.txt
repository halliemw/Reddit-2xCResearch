Have you discussed with him what you'd do if you get pregnant? Me personally, I intend to abort if I do, so I feel okay with "just" using the pill. However, some people are more like "I don't really want a kid now but if I do get pregnant I won't abort", and in that case it might be best to use condoms or pulling out as well. All three of them seems a bit overkill though. As far as I know, the chances of you getting pregnant if you always take the pill on time (and don't throw up soon after or something) are very, very small. One thing I've thought about though is: what if my boyfriend and I have sex and he cums in me, and then I get stomach flu and throw up and have diarrhea for 2-3 days so the pills don't have time to digest before I lose them? Could I get pregnant from the semen in me? But like I said, I'd abort and it's not that difficult or expensive where I live, so I'm willing to take that small risk.
