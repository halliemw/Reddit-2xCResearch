I have, it was odd... but certainly wasn't painful or anything. The wand was fairly slim and the tech knew just what she was looking for so she was done (I almost said "in and out" *sigh*) pretty quickly. The Dr's assistant somewhat chirpily explained that "it's easier to see what's in a house by walking around rather than peeking through the windows" the tech laughed when is told her my eggs weren't worth enough to justify casing the joint.

I'm happy to answer questions about it, I just don't know what would be of interest.
