I think it absolutely depends, I'm in Belfast and I got it quite a bit in uni and in job interviews, really depressed me. I still get weird looks just for being a girl in a hackerspace, then when they realise my SO is there too it's suddenly alright, I assume they think I'm just following him around or there to make him dinner or something.
