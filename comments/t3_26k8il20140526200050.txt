I think it's up to how someone feels about themselves in a bikini, not how other's perceive them. If heavier people feel comfortable and confident in a bikini, more power to them! Everyone should embrace their body type and wear what makes them feel the best. I normally do not wear bikinis, but that's because I feel more comfortable and like how I look in one pieces. And that's fine too! Everyone should wear what they like.
