As another expat, what you're experiencing is TOTALLY NORMAL. And it doesn't mean you're going to waste it.... it just means you've hit some roadblocks and you're miles away from home with a partner who isn't experiencing the same things as you are. Yeah, it sucks but you can turn this around and make it one of the best summers of your life. You just need to get some control back.

You should identify what you wanted to achieve and what's no longer possible first off. Clearly, you feel as if your career is stalling and that's pretty scary stuff. Think about what aspects of your job you were supposed to be doing while abroad and then get in touch with your boss. You want to get a situation where even if you're not exactly where you want to be you're still searching for opportunities within your job to exercise your skills and learn new ones. Without knowing the ins and outs of your job I can't be more specific, but I'm sure you can do this. 

Second, identify all the things that being in Italy enables. Naturally language skills - you're probably not going to be at the specialist professional proficiency in a few months but you can certainly improve from where you are now. How? By getting out. Sure you're working from home but honestly could you do that work in a public space? Flexitime? Get out and engage with locals and other expats. Try meetup.com and other networking sites to see if there are others around who you have the faintest thing in common with and then get out and meet them. Do things. Hire an italian housekeeper for a few hours a week and get her to teach you how to make a killer dish. 

Third, this is only temporary. The absolute worse case is that you spend until September working on your tan. You'll soon be home, so if you really feel that your job is not working for you then start searching for a new one. Might as well if you're logged on waiting for emails, right?

Set targets, tick them off.
