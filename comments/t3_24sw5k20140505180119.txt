I know those feels. I was with my last ex for 8 years and we had been in couple's therapy for the last year. I supported him through college and a year of Americorps, managed our life, even did most of the chores. 

Last summer he went to a friend's wedding out of state. When he came back he brougt up a specific issue in our next session that was do or die for us and we agreed on a timeline to either fix it or end it. I was pretty sure we wouldn't fix it but I was looking forward to wrapping up amicably. 

Lo and behold, he had fallen in love with his friend's sister when he was at the wedding. So 4 days later he decides fuck it, we're done. He doesn't tell me about this woman, though, and was generally a piece of shit throughout the process. 

And you know? I feel fucking amazing now. I spent a couple of weeks being ridiculously drunk with my friends and then I started reveling in everything I couldn't do when he was around. He was allergic to flowers, so I started buying them weekly. He couldn't have a pet; I'm getting a cat. Etc. 

It's been about 9 months and I'm super happy. I'm seeing a couple of different people I like, I'm having great sex, I rearranged my apartment and I fucking love it, and no one but me leaves their goddamned dirty socks on the floor. 

Oh, and his new lady dumped him a month ago. So, karma, I guess?
