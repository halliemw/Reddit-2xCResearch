From Wikipedia: "About 5% of treated patients may encounter moderate to severe OHSS. Risk factors include young age, the development of many ovarian follicles under stimulation, extreme elevated serum estradiol concentrations, the use of hCG for final oocyte maturation and/or release, the continued use of hCG for luteal support, and the occurrence of a pregnancy (resulting in hCG production)."

This is part of the reason why I was required to go to the clinic every two days for blood draws and ultrasounds.
