Your parents are bigoted morons. They think they're being progressive and accepting you for who you are, but the only reason they think you're a lesbian is because you sort of fall into the stereotype of one. Stereotyping is bad.

Even if you were gay though, they don't get to force you to come out. It's about you, not them, and trying to do that is kind of fucked up. Okay at first they express concern and let you know they are comfortable with everything, but that's it. You know you, you are you, and they just need to accept that you are an individual, not merely their child.
