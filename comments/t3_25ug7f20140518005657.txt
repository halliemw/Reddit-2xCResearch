Your not crazy. The heart and head are two different things. Sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is the most painful. Ask yourself this. Can you forget what happened and fully trust. Is it worth the pain to continue. If you say no then you have your answer. Because you still love him after the pain he caused, you know It's a real love unconditionally. I'm so sorry to hear your heart was toyed with. Good luck.
