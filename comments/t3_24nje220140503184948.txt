I wasn't an early bloomer by any means, but my parents made sure I was well-supplied with books from a fairly early age just in case. It meant that when I had a question about whether something was normal, I didn't have to ask, and I was informed about what changes were going to happen well before they actually took place. I'd recommend *The Care and Keeping of You* which covers all the stages of everything and how to care for a growing, changing body in a way that's age-appropriate for any pre-pubescent kid, even in second grade. If you aren't sure yet whether this is puberty or not, you might consider trying to find ways to talk about some of the potential changes and try to normalize them as much as possible. My mom did that when I was about her age, and really I think it's a good idea whether she's on the verge of puberty or not. 

I will say that some of this could be hormonal for reasons other than puberty or it could be social. Kids can be cruel, and if she's been bullied by kids who tell her she stinks or something like that, that could contribute to the obsession with cleanliness and the moodiness in general. Kids going through a growth spurt often eat a lot right before they grow, so it might not be a puberty thing. This should be discussed with her doctor for sure, because while precocious puberty isn't harmful in itself, and is actually very common in children of certain ethnic backgrounds, it can cause problems if it's happening before her bones and joints and things are ready for it. Her pediatrician should be able to guide you as far as whether she's going through something normal and healthy or not. They should definitely be consulted because if she's 5' tall or shorter and her father is 6'5" and her mother is an average height, then she's currently much shorter than her expected adult height and that could be a concern if it is puberty already.
