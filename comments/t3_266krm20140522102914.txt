It sounds pretty impossible to me too so that's even more reason to go ahead and get an over the counter test. And let's say it did tell you that you're pregnant. The reading doesn't mean anything until you get a doctor pregnancy test to confirm. Hormone levels can be high for more than just pregnancy. And if you really are pregnant you don't have to have the baby. It's your choice what goes on in your body and if you aren't ready for kids now then you can terminate that pregnancy. 

It's going to be okay even if you are pregnant, which I think it's incredibly unlikely. Don't stress for a week over a test that can take all that away, if it shows positive that just means you need to see a doctor.
