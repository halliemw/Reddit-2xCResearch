This is normal, I recently had to research this phenomenon for DAYS to find any clues to what it was. Of course I forget what it's called now. But yes, there is a white mucous/oil that can appear under the surface of the nipple. You are not supposed to pop them or open them, they open on their own (causing those dead skin flaps) and opening them sooner can cause infection. They are basically there to provide lubrication for your nipples so they don't get cracked and dry. Some people speculate they get more noticeable during ovulation, possibly preparing your breasts for pregnancy/nursing. I get the exact same thing two or three times a year.
