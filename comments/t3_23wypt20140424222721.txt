After I stopped taking birth control, my periods got a lot lighter than they had been pre-birth control. Totally normal! Even now, I have the ParaGard and I still only have two heavy days and the rest are super light. 

As a side note, cups are a great way of actually measuring how much blood we're losing. Tampons can be really deceiving because they don't hold nearly as much! They're also a lot better for your body and the environment, so huzzah!
