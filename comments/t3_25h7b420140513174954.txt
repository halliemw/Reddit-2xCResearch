The way I look at it is this: if we all agree that murder is wrong and therefore have laws punishing it, why would we then turn around and say 'oh, you don't have enough money to pay for this procedure and you may die without it? Sorry...' That's basically what's going on when you start equating money on hand with healthcare. It's to the benefit of society when people have access to healthcare - like I showed in the link, it actually costs *more* to limit access than it would to provide it. Think about all the additional sick days alone! 

A profit system is beneficial for the advancement of the monetary interests of the companies involved. The R&D and drugs that have been patented are not worth the vast cost in human lives and suffering.
