When I entered middle school, I developed an intense body shyness that didn't really disappear until a year ago when I was a senior in high school. I distinctly remember being a stick thin 7th grader and going to my yearly checkup, when my doctor asked my mom to leave so we could talk in private. She asked me if I felt anything was wrong with my body, and I said I thought my legs were fat. (To show you how crazy I was, at this point I was 5'6", 120 lbs, and a size 5.) She kindly but firmly told me that wasn't true, and it made me feel somewhat better. Still, throughout middle school and high school, I was intensely self-conscious about wearing anything shorter than capris, and I hated it when people looked at me because I was convinced my thighs and butt were too big. Now I look back on that and laugh. I'm proud that I actually have a figure!
