Can you take an at-home pregnancy test?

I know just thinking about getting a result must freak you out, but I would do it soon so you can decide about canceling the vacation for termination money.

Early terminations when 'babby is not even formed' yet are also less violent to your uterus, as far as I know.

So, take some quick pregnancy tests and get that abortion shit behind you as fast as you can (if even needed).
