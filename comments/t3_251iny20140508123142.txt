Given his relative inexperience, I think in this case you're headed in the right direction. If the situation were different - if he were less naive and you thought he fully understood the consequences of what he was doing and what it meant to you - I would say that you should react more strongly.

The trick is watching his future behavior. People who break trust repeatedly generally continue to do so. If you can get through the period of emotional turmoil caused by his behavior, things can work out. Whatever you do, though, don't watch it happen again and go down the "I'll give him one more chance..." road. Repeated infidelity (by whatever definition, in whatever degree) should mean the end of your time together as a couple. There are plenty of great guys out there who are decent human beings. People who repeatedly cheat are not.
