i wouldn't recommend the diva cup if you've never used it before.
it can take a few cycles to figure it out, i had a *lot* of leakage. also, it looked like a blood bath every time i tried to empty it (it often still does). personally, i would never take the cup anywhere where i don't have running water...
of course plenty of women swear by them, so worth a try. if you do try the cup, bring enough alternative supplies to fall back on if it doesn't work out for you.


note that a sponge doesn't have a handy-dandy string. i have tried sponges and had a bitch of a time getting them back out. i wouldn't want to be digging around in my vagina with dirty hands.


i think tampons would be the easiest and least messy.
>  5. Tampons can be burned in a campfire, but remember that it takes a very hot fire and considerable time to completely burn them.

you probably shouldn't be burying anything if you are in bear country (srs), you would have to bring it back out with you if there are no trash receptacles.

don't forget toilet paper!
