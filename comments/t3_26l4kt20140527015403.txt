Everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion. People like your brother, no offense, thinks that his mind is the most righteous, as he thinks he is privileged. Little does he know that he needs to mature sooner or later, and to be responsible. I know someone who forces his thoughts into me, and trust me when I say his life is pathetic. Don't fret as nobody should affect you mentally. You are you and never let anybody put you down. It just shows that they need approval they still have yet to receive.
