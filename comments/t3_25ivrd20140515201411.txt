I would guess that a lot of men open up to their girlfriends emotionally on a level way beyond what they have with their male friends. Then they end up with all of their eggs in one basket in terms of emotional support. Women do this to some degree, too, as it's natural that your SO will be the person you feel closest too, but the difference is that they have other friends and family who they talk to about feelings. Although it's understandable why a guy would depend solely on his girlfriend for emotional support, it's obviously problematic. That should never fall just on one person. So a man who finds himself in such a position needs to realize that the loneliness he is feeling is only partly because his girlfriend left him; it's largely because he doesn't have a support network. That's the real problem.
