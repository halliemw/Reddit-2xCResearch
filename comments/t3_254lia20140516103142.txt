I dunno if OP is going to get back to you re this, but in our (small-ish) city, the bike rescue is a pretty well-connected facet of radical culture. It participates heavily in community activism regarding not just bikes but also social justice issues.

Supposing you are not plugged into any radical community at all, there are still lots of ways to find out if a bike rescue exists in your town. Start with cycling clubs. Most urban and regional areas have one. For example, NYBC (New York Bike Coalition), organizers in bike clubs will usually interface with a lot of different groups for fitness, urban-planning/safe-streets initiatives, and bike rescues for their own reach. Bike commuters tend to know more about bike resources too, especially if they are involved in local government or community activism (usually the progressive types). Places where young, lefty/progressive-types congregate like DIY community spaces/show-spaces, food co-ops, etc. may have flyers posted. Sometimes, the organization may call itself a bike "collective" rather than a bike "rescue", but the functions may be similar.

Our geographical area is composed of three small-to-medium-size cities, and each of them has a bike rescue. There's bike rescues in tiny towns like Moscow, Idaho and Woodstock, NY. I would be surprised if you lived in an urban area with population ~200,000+ without one.
