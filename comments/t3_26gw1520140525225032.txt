It's not cheap, but I got a one piece from Seafolly awhlie back. [This one.](http://www.anthropologie.com/anthro/product/23716723.jsp?cm_vc=SEARCH_RESULTS#/) It's gorgeous and is the first suit I've actually been comfortable in. I'm a 36D and my boobs are contained and lookin' fine, and it seems to be of great quality. Plus the little leggy bits make up for my reluctance to shave/shitty shaving skills.
