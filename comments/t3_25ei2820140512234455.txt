Hilariously enough, they are completely correct, but: this is equally true for men voters. It is beyond obvious that one's statements can be completely disconnected from reality and still result in being elected.

This mostly has to do with the fact that the notion of "predictive capability of models" is completely foreign to the electorate, and that is the most important thing in controlling dynamic systems, such as a nation.
