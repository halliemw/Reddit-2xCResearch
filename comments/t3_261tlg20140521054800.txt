It doesn't sound like you would be having fun going, at least as long as this condition stands. So don't.

That leaves two ways to go about this, either calmly tell them you're not buying a one piece just for this pool party and you won't be going as long as they can't make you feel welcome the way you are, or just make up an excuse if you don't want to fight this fight. If they start with this but the birthday girl will miss you stuff just tell them is in their hands or that you regret to be unable to come. It helps to stick to one sentence and just repeat it if you have a hard time saying no and they are slow to accept your position.
