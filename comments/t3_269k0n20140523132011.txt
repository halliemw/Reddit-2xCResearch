We should be careful about referring to porn as the thing which pushed her "over the edge". As far as we know, this is a girl who made a legitimate choice, who was then made to feel wrong or ashamed for having made it. Blame for her suicide lies with the people who bullied her, not with her decision to appear in porn.

I share your general sentiment that the whole thing is icky, though. When my sister killed herself, we were contacted by the newspaper because one of her nurses (!) was trying to spin her death as related to recent budget cuts. We had the luxury of being able to stop them from running with the story. I don't think this girl's family did. It really sucks to have other people use your personal loss as an element in their constructed narrative, even when that narrative might have some validity. 

I think the reason this feels so wrong is that the girl's family (not to mention the girl herself) are having the power to control the narrative of their loss taken away from them, in a situation where they already feel extremely powerless.
