(This might sound callous, but I assure you I do not mean it that way.)

Your body is racked with hormones right now. I had an abortion about five years ago and I was an absolute wreck for almost two months after it. I cried over everything, I couldn't sleep, I was irritable and sensitive, I wanted a kitten something fierce to replace the loss. The hormones in my system made me feel like I made a horrible mistake. As time passed, I started to realize that I had done the right thing for my life. It took almost 6 months before I really came to terms with the choice. The father bailed on me a couple months after the abortion. I found a new job, moved, bought a house, traveled, met new people etc. Life went on and I now know that I would have been a single mother with a very different life and quite bitter. I wasn't ready to be a mother. Financially or mentally. 

I'm not making assumptions to your situation or saying that you're in an identical position but just be aware that your body chemistry is very different because of the pregnancy and that can effect your emotional stability and thought behavior. Give yourself a little time before letting the guilt weigh you down. See a doctor, talk with your sister or a therapist maybe.
