>People die from natural causes all the time, even young people. That doesn't make it ok to kill them.

These women had spontaneous abortions and/or stillbirths. Their pregnancies were not viable. Women's bodies naturally abort about 2/3rds of the pregnancies they create, often because said pregnancies are not healthy.  Abortion is a natural function of a woman's body and outlawing it is ignorant and stupid. So is insisting that abortion is murder. It is the natural function of a woman's body to kick out a bad pregnancy.

You should read the articles before you comment or at least read the headline. Then read an Embryology textbook; most zygotes and embryos die a natural death before they are born, far more often than they are able to develop into a viable human life. Punishing women for when pregnancy fails is medieval and misogynistic as well as anti-science nonsense.
