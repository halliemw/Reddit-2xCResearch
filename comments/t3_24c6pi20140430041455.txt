I'm sorry you're going through this. It's not your fault; your doctor was irresponsible, not you, and you are still being responsible now. You may have some regret, but it certainly sounds as though you'd have more regret if you didn't do this. 
Keep the communication strong with your partner; although you're doing this together, you will both be going though different experiences of it. Be gentle with one another.
And remember that you are not alone, and that your friends at 2X are here for you. 
You're going to be OK, even if it sucks now. Sending you internet hugs!
