I was actually thinking that MRAs should be the ones spreading this message. Not that "women are human, respect them", that's "radical feminism", after all. The phrase "It's okay if you don't to get laid tonight" is neutral, it doesn't use the language that MRAs hate ("rape culture", "consent", feminist stuff like this). This phrase tells men that their worth is not measured in the amount of sex they had. The message is positive and related to men's issues - such as low-self esteem that develops when young men "fail" to meet social expectations of being a "stud".


But nope nope nope. Their front page is an anti-feminist shitfest as usual. I suppose fighting the Gynocracy is much more important than "compassion for men and boys".
