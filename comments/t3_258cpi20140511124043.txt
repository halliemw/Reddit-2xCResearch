Hey, started dating after my 20+year marriage ended.  Tell her to look at the whole thing as an experiment.  She can just get used to talking with a man in a friendly situation.  Even if there is no spark she can be glad to get a "meet and greet" notch on her belt.  Every time she does this she'll feel more comfortable and be more at ease.

It sounds like a good set up.  Maybe they can be friends if they don't have a romantic connection.

The Borat thing is funny!
