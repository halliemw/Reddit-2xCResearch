I found TwoX about 3 or 4 years ago when there were less then 20k subscribers, all on my own... I don't mean any offense, but it wasn't exactly hidden then even. We shouldn't need to be default for users that are interested in a woman's perspective to find us. I'm glad you're here now, but you probably would have found TwoX on your own eventually.
