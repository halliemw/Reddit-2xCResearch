It's the Hell Bunny Vanda, and you can get it cheaper at [Hot Topic](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Features/Rockabilly/Hell+Bunny+Vanda+Dress-10123355.jsp) than at [Modcloth](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/blueberry-buckle-dress) (especially if you wait for Hot Topic to do 30% off sitewide).
