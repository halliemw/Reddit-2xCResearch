Very true. A person very close to me who I trusted and loved was once investigated on suspicions of CP possession. That messed with my head like nothing I've ever experienced, and was so traumatic and shocking and just... A total mindfuck. 

Now I don't trust virtually anyone. Seriously. I remember the first day I went back to work after that happened, and just looking at all the people around me (particularly men, as this person was a man) and being disgusted and suspicious of all of them. It is shocking when this sort of thing happens with someone so close to you.

I thank God that this happened before I had a child of my own. It taught me not only that this person can't be trusted, but that you *never* know what a person does behind closed doors.
