Saying hurtful things that belittle one's role as the sole sexual partner in a relationship or as a human because of their sex and then saying, "What's the problem, I'm just joking!" is a really gross tactic used by people I hate being around. I don't know the motivation, are they immature and don't know how to behave in socially appropriate ways, or are they trying to manipulate others to do what they want by gaslighting or deploying "dread game?"

Of course we should always talk to our partners about this stuff, so that's the first obvious suggestion. Talk to this guy. You've been together 7 months, he has to have some great qualities. But a dude who makes bold statements and then hides behind the idea that it was all a joke is at best not good at relationships with humans or at worst slimey and cruel. Tell him how you feel. Write it down and read it to him if you worry about him talking you out of what you have to say, distracting and derailing you, or not letting you finish. Then see how he wants to proceed. 

If it's a thing he's doing accidentally *and he wants to change*, you can help him get better (if you still want to be in the relationship with him). If he tells you you're overreacting or crazy, he doesn't care that you just told him his actions are hurting you, and you should think about making the next step to keep yourself happy and healthy.
