Yeah, I could kind of see where you were coming from even if I didn't agree. If it helps I didn't downvote you, I don't think you should have been downvoted for offering different advice.

I can kind of see what you mean, I just don't agree based on my own experiences. When I was bullied, everyone tried to say "Oh they're just jealous" to me, but that only made me feel worse. I thought it was my fault for having something to be jealous of, I thought 'they could have whatever they want if they just left me alone'. 

I think if we explain that bullies are genuinely horrible people who have never been taught to be nice it may work better - then we learn that bullying is not related in any way to us personally, it's just a horrible person saying whatever they can to be horrible. More recently where I live bullying is seen as a disgusting embarrassing thing to do, and I think that helps because the victim things 'my bully is a horrible person no matter what i look like' rather than 'i wish I was like x so i wouldn't be bullied'.
