I've honestly never had a problem, but for some reason I always come off as a guy on the internet.  So much so I've been attacked by women and called a pervert when I've had my gender marked as female-for that reason I usually don't list gender online anymore.  

Though I usually play male characters, even when I have played female characters I've never run into issues.  

However, I was very proud when I saw my little brother telling some guys off for saying derogatory things about female gamers.
