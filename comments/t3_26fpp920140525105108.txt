dyspareunia affects many people, so you are not alone! Getting another opinion is always a good idea (there are lots of structural things that can cause it) but it can also be caused by insufficient foreplay, lack of lube (lube is your friend!) and anxiety among other things. Sometimes it can be helpful to have an orgasm before penetrative sex--have you tried that? Vibrators, oral sex, manual stimulation...these can all be helpful.
