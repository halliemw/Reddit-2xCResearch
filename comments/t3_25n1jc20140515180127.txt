The only thing I had trouble explaining was the whole "trying" part.  My husband and I talked and agreed to kids, but we never "tried."  We were just not not trying to get pregnant?  That was always hard to figure out how to explain.  I totally understand it's usually a well thought out process, but not always!  There were no schedules or anything involved.  My husband and I almost always used birth control pills or IUD, rarely condoms so there wasn't a whole lot of transitioning from one method to the other for us.  I'm pregnant now, due in October.  it's an exciting and crazy experience!
