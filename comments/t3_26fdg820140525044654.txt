What kind of danger are you thinking about? Stranger danger when you're walking alone at night? Date rape danger at a party? The former is far less likely to happen to you than the latter. 

Don't worry too much about "being alone in public". What you really need is experience in a lot of different kinds of social situations. You'll only get that by putting yourself out there. If you start with relatively safe meetups or college groups you can gradually build up your internal register of how to react in various situations, and then apply that experience as you go further. 

As for practical advice, there's [this](http://www.crime-safety-security.com/women-safety-date-rape.html) and [this](http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/13-characteristics-of-a-date-rapist-a-list-you-need-to-share/), which are probably more useful than stuff about how to avoid strangers when you're alone in a parking lot.
