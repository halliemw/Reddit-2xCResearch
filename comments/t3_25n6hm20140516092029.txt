Unfortunately, I've learned to just avoid situations where this happens. I don't like walking by streets, or anywhere, really. I don't like to go anywhere by myself. But even in my car, sitting in traffic, people will drive by and yell at me. It's hard to ignore it. We shouldn't have to hide from it.
