Thank you so much for sharing. It sounds to me like the reasons you were harassed on the street as a kid are definitely related to the reasons many women are harassed on the street -- masculinity is "good" and (perceived) femininity is "bad."

>Misogyny, in my experience, is not only hostility toward women, but hostility toward anything "unmasculine." I know it's not the first thing anyone thinks of when they think about misogyny, or, in turn, feminism, when there are so many more real, dire problems that need to be address urgently... but part of gender equality is reassessing all those thing we view as "masculine" or "feminine" traits and not evaluating them as negative regardless of the gender they're applied to or expressed by.

This is exactly what I tell my guy friends/acquaintances when they scoff at the idea of the patriarchy -- it makes life shittier for everyone.
