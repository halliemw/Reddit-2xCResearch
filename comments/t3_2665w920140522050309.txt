I've seen a lot of stuff around this issue and trust me, the people who are doing this whole victim thing don't want help. If you tell them to get help, they either respond with "I shouldn't need 'help', I should be accepted for who I am" or "I've already been to [X number] of therapists/doctors and they were all bad and none of them got me".
