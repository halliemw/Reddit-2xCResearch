You were raped. I am happy to inform you that your 19 years husband raped you. Congratulations. 

Unless you exaggerate your drunkenness, your ability to consent to a sexual act was at least severely impaired, probably non-existent.

Now if you would be so kind to notify your local authorities so they can arrest, prosecute and put your husband in jail. If you are not willing to cooperate, they will be forced to use your IP address to track him down, as he poses a great risk to society. 

disclaimer: not a member of 2X community. My post evidently uses a definition of rape and a duty to prosecute that will not be accepted as long as any sane jurisprudence influence exists in the lawmaking process.
