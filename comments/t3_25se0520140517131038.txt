WOW! I can not even comprehend how brave this woman is. I'm a guy, and about 8 years ago I lost over 100lbs, and I'm basically covered in stretchmarks and loose skin everywhere between my elbows, knees, and neck. I could never do what she did. My body causes me an insane amount of anxiety, and really limits what I can do in my life. No beaches *ever*, and no travelling to anyplace warm. No camping, or ever going anywhere where swimming would be expected. Dating is a nightmare that even the thought of gives me panic attacks.

This was a very powerful article.
