I know you're being bombarded with suggestions for how to get blood out but seriously...shampoo. I read about the tip online a long time ago, thought it was silly but tried it in a moment of desperation, and holy shit gurl. It worked. Flawlessly. No stain at all was left over. Just poured a small amount of shampoo directly on top, massaged it in, then ran it under water while continuing to massage the spot. Magic.
