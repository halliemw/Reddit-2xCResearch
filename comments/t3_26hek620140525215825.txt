I have always loved saris. You look gorgeous and I can't believe that sari is almost 30, looks quite new to me! I found a sari at a thrift store and bought it because it was beautiful. My mom is a great deal shorts and smaller then me but when I was a kid I used to love to sleep in her teddies and silk pj sets. Now we just borrow each other's jewelry.
