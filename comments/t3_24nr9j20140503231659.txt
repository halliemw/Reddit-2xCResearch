I totally get it. But I know horrendous human beings who have found people willing to put up with them til death do they part. So you're probably alright. ;)

Seriously though, just relax. Enjoy you. It's important to find out who *you* are without the addendum of another person. Get into something you love. Deeply. You're a really rad person, find out exactly who that fabulous lady is. I ended up rediscovering how much I love bicycles and wrenchwork (which my dad got me into as a kid) after a breakup, and it actually was part of the reason I'm with the man I'm with now.

Tell you what. If you get ever get freaked out, feel free to PM me for platitudes and whatnot. :)
