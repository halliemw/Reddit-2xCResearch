I've been around twox and was initially frustrated, but I've come around to hoping this will impact reddit.  My two cents:

1) What's done is done the trolls have been let in, kinda late to hide from them. I don't like backing down because of them. If we want the internet to be less man centered the women can't hide. 

2) We've boosted the growth of other fem positive places like /r/SRSwomen and /r/femmethoughts There are other safe space communities opening up that wouldn't have. 

We can help shift the default perspective to less misogyny.  It's selfish to want the girls only tree house back.  The hejira is necessary but painful. The cause is noble or something. This sub became a default and default is generally a male perspective and I come and go to not burn out on pushing back and trying to patiently educate or police.  If we want things to change, women's view points need more attention, not less.
