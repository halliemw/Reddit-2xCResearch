It makes me think of patrick stewart's talk about how the police would tell his mom it takes two to start a fight. He's a supporter of Refuge in the UK for domestic violence and [ugh I can't remember now] another charity for sufferers of PTSD because the thinks that's why his dad was so violent towards his mother. But he always crosses his arms and his hands clench a bit when he says that line about "It takes two to start a fight Mrs. Stewart" and it really shows how blaming the victim for abuse harms those who watch it happen like their kids. 

Anyway, somewhat relevant about how messed up that line of thinking is.
