>However, I know you don't want to hear this, but I do find your abortion more valid (for a lack of a better word or phrase) than someone who knowingly was neglectful with using birth control and essentially used abortions are their method of birth control.

Who gets to decide which abortions are 'valid' and which are not? Are you going to set up some committee that gets to air out and judge the sexual history of every woman who needs an abortion and decide whether she's deserving or not?

Some women will always be dipshits and abuse the system. Every statistic we have about women who get abortions says that these people are in the vast minority. And you don't want those dipshits having kids anyhow, trust me.
