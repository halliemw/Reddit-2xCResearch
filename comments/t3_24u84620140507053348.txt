The way I describe it is that Marvel movies are made by people who love the characters, while DC movies are made by people who hate the characters. The Nolan Batman movies really felt like they didn't want to be about Batman, and Man of Steel REALLY didn't embrace Superman. If they made a Wonder Woman movie with the same attitude, I would absolutely die inside.
