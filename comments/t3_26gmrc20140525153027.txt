I've had one too many run ins with creeps at my service job and now I don't hesitate to call the cops. Maybe this seems extreme but if u don't feel safe or a coworker doesn't then I have every right to call the cops and make or better. I'm not 100% certain, but I think your work can't legally reprimand you for callin the cops on a customer. Keep yourself safe!
