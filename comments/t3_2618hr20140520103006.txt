I've got to say I'm a mildly active member here and I have never had anything like that happen. If it does though and the mods weren't able to rectify it, you'd best be sure I'd be calling the person out publicly. But we also don't know what you've said that may or may not have elicited such a strong reaction - you never know what people will key in on. I say come back, be open minded and don't allow yourself to get bullied.
