thank you! you speak my language. also vaginal microbial flora is important for the development of the immune system of a newly vaginally born infant. 

the problems with bacteria on skin is hardly problematic. it is as you said, a skin thing, and less a hair thing. the difference between the axillary area and the ventral bracheal area if skin has more to do with pores (which do involve the hair follicles, but not the hair itself), and the excretion involved with the pores. basically different "types" of skin have different things they secrete (sweat, sebum, wax) and these are changed even more by the underlying vasculature, and interstitial environment. 

i wouldn't argue if you said that pubic hair could be important during pregnancy, especially in the last trimester (where grooming could be the most difficult and hormone levels are having major impacts on all epithelial secretions). however, in women who are not pregnant it is more of a personal choice and less of an issue about hygiene (although there are mild hygienic concerns with both lack of hair, and with hair).

i agree that sexuality of males is primarily formed during puberty. i believe the norm for shaved vaginas, legs, underarms, and other body hair has already become set. you would have to target your message at 9-16 year old girls if you want to change this in the future, and that is not likely to work since they are emotional wrecks and conform to whatever the television and magazines tell them to think. (even the ones who escape this, have the media influence their decisions through cultural norms followed by their peers). 

if you really wanted to be effective you might consider campaigning to have girls home schooled during puberty, and to give young boys access to pornography that is more in line with the new norms you are trying to set.
