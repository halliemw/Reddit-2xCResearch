I agree, there's something especially annoying about getting orders from a stranger to look nicer for their pleasure.

When I've had the presence of mind, I've answered, "MY MOM JUST DIED, ASSHOLE." I think it conveys the idea that I've got other things to think about than whether my facial expression is adequately pleasing to some rando.
