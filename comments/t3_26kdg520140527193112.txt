Thanks for your response and encouragement!  God, "Tits McGee", i HOPE nobody does that to me.  I already am called "Sticky" or "Stick Girl" or "Twiggy" or just "Twig".  My Grandpa calls me "Bean pole", whatever that means.  He doesn't see that I kinda hate it :(


Can I ask you one question???? You said "I like the nickname, and I like my boobs, **they're fun**".   Can I ask exactly HOW, they're fun?  I mean, I get it that some boys like them, but I don't plan on letting any of them get anywhere close to them!  My family are pretty regular church-goers, and our youth pastor teaches pretty non-stop about sexual purity, lol.  I got it the first time, he doesn't have to keep pounding it home. (Ha, I made a joke!)


Would you mind sharing?
