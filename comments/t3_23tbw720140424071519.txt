Wanna be friends?  25 here, also in Tennessee, and you sound a lot like me.  I'm a huge homebody, don't go out often, no drinking, no drugs (had problems with both in the past so both are off limits to me now) and that makes it way difficult to meet people my age, it seems.  I moved to Tennessee (Chatt) to be with my boyfriend of a year or so who also abstains (he's straight edge and vegetarian) so it seems like we'd have some things in common!
