I picked the pill over, say, the patch, mainly because I hate the feeling of stuff on my skin. I can't stop playing with it. Like, I can't keep a bandaid on me for longer than an hour, so let's not try that with essential baby-preventative hormones. And the nuva ring... eh, the idea of it getting bumped out during sex terrifies me. You can't bump a pill out unless you vomit or something, you know?

And finally, I didn't pick an IUD because I got on the pill when I was like 17, having very much never been pregnant, so understandably my doctor didn't even suggest it. I know now that they CAN be inserted in women who have never been pregnant, but now my main obstacle is that it's super expensive, and I'm worried about having to deal with my natural, irregular as fuck cycle for 5 years! Gross.
