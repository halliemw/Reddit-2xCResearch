Ive been a lurker for quite a while, but decided to stomp out of the woodworks because of the crap I saw when TwoX went default. My approach right now is killing with kindness.


Im sure this will blow over (almost kinda uppity about the thought that the poor little boysclub might actually be banned for brigading this time) and that the mods are equipped to handle it. They wouldnt have said yes to default otherwise, right?


CreepyPMs is a wonderful little place I enjoy, and even though they dont have this sort of massive attacks all the time they handle influxes perfectly. Its possible.
