My parents wouldn't let me do anything "dangerous" growing up, so now as a 23 year old who just bought her first house, I am having a goddamned BLAST mowing the lawn and trimming bushes, etc. Whereas my husband hates it since he had to do it as a chore as a kid.

I feel a little silly being this old and just now learning how to do these things, but at least I'm enjoying it as a result.
