In a perfect world, we'd teach more about this in sex ed classes, human biology classes, gender classes - and biology classes in general.

But we don't.  AFAIK, there are pro's and con's to every way of handling heavy bleeding (and many women don't know whether or not it's heavy - they wait until they find out they're severely anemic).  

I didn't notice any change due to IUD use - but that's just anecdotal.  And when it got heavier, it wasn't because of the IUD (fibroids) but I sort of assumed it was and ignored it.
