I'm hearing a flicker of the unsafe feeling coming off OP and I am hesitant to disregard it because, well, this is the kind of thing that guys murder their girlfriends and wives over. as OP seems to have heard the gift to fear calling. she needs to heed that voice. 

let's hope it's not that serious. 

I would like to think it's not that serious. 

but I'm hearing a lot of what sound like dude voices on this thread that sound unusual for this sub (dang blasted being put on the default list) that are saying she owes him the truth. or trying to shame OP into putting herself into a potentially dangerous situation. I find this alarming. 

OP's need to keep safe is more important than this random guy's need to have his day ruined. he does not have a right to know about things that would not otherwise impact his life.
