Research is actively done to prevent people from dying of natural causes. However, the anti-choice movement isn't lobbying the government to research what they should consider to be the biggest tragedy and greatest killer ever. Apparently they only care about pregnancies that are actively ended. Plus, a fetus cannot be a person for the majority of the pregnancy. 

Currently, states like [Iowa](http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/linc/85/external/HF138_Introduced.pdf) have introduced bills that classify abortion as murder, targeting abortionists and women who consent to them. 

There are a lot of [anti-choicers](http://www.prochoice.org/policy/courts/supreme_bios.html) in SCOTUS, which may pose a problem for the future rights of women in America.
