Let me start off by saying, I am envious that you do not have to work 40+ hours a week and go to school full-time. Working at a restaurant chain or retail chain would not make you feel better...trust me. Been there, still doing that. Working 2 jobs at the moment and going to school full-time. My SO is doing the same. It honestly does not make me feel anymore fulfilled. I feel tired all the time and like I am just making money to throw away on bills. 

Rephrase the situation to yourself. You *do* have a job, you *do* pay for your own bills, you *do* go to school. If anything I would suggest picking up more hours at school and get that degree in something you love. Don't worry about what your family says, worry about how *you* feel. Working more hours at jobs you dislike is not going to make you happy. Trust me. Just worry about your education and get it over and done with so you can start working in a field you enjoy! Also, cooking and cleaning makes me feel more needed at home...I love when my SO loves my unique dinners. Maybe try out some new and more complicated dishes. :) Maybe start some home DIY projects to spruce up your home. 

And friends always help. Get together for lunch dates or movie dates or sit-on-the-couch-and-watch-reality-tv dates. Gossip. laugh. Try on clothes...whatever it is you like to do. Always makes me feel better, too.
