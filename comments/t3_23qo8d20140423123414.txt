That sounds like such a stressful time; I can't even imagine. I suppose my best advice is to remind yourself that it's a transitional period - it's not forever, just for now, and a lot of the things that you're worrying about, you won't really be able to address/know for sure until you're out of the transition. Do you have a good community or mentor, either in person or in an online space, that you can talk with or just read content from to help buoy you along when you're feeling down about it?

Ultimately, when I'm having really low days, my coping mechanism is sleep - not 24/7 sleep, but just going to bed once my work day is over and I've had dinner/a bath. It lets me rest and recuperate, and I can't actively worry or fret in my sleep. I always assure myself that if I just go to bed, things will be better tomorrow, and no matter how many tomorrows things are not quite better, I continue to promise myself that the next tomorrow will be better. Eventually, you will wake up and find that you've gotten to that better tomorrow. Good luck with your transition; I hope that it's able to be everything that you want it to be!
