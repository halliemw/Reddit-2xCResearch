I understand. I don't think he intended it maliciously at all. I think he was drunk and there was a girl sleeping next to him who he may or may not have thought was Kristen, and I woke up to it and with my history honestly didn't know what to do. I know this is one of those grey situations which is why I wanted to talk to the online community about it.

I just don't know where to go from here. I can't tell Kristen or Sean. It would kill them. And Jacob apparently has said to Kristen he doesn't rememember anything from last night. Whether that is true or not all of the burden is on me for where to go from here, and what is right or wrong to do.
