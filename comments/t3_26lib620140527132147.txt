The moral of the story seems to be anyone can abuse and molest, not just males. And no matter who does it it's not okay. Period. 

I think responsibility here falls to parents. Little girls should feel comfortable telling their parents about any sort of abuse. They should also be well informed that it's not okay for anyone, girl or boy, to touch you or make you feel uncomfortable. I wonder how many parents typically think about a situation like yours.
