This is a tough one as I don't have any friends or family who had a pregnancy during high school....

I am still trying to make my mind up...I can see both sides. But, even with teen moms at my school...I don't think they were exactly proud of their situation enough to be featured in a 2 page spread.
I am very curious to read the thoughts of someone who actually was or is a teen mom who has an opinion on this story.
