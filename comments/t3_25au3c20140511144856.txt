You can find a list of some pills & their active ingredients [here](http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=103991&page=3). Unfortunately, it's just not possible to have a place with reviews written by other women. Everyone reacts so differently, it's essentially meaningless. Some women, for instance, worship Nuva Ring, other women find it made them 100% batty. You say you loved Depo, other women were completely miserable on it. As far as I'm aware, there's essentially no way to predict this, and you just do trial and error (which is frustrating).

If you're hesitant to try pills again, have you thought about options like the Nuva Ring or Mirena IUD that provide low/localized hormone doses, or the copper IUD, that works without hormones? I have Paragard, which was 100% covered by my insurance.
