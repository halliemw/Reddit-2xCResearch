Along with STEM_femme's suggestion for a spare cell phone, I'd recommend getting an international calling card to keep on you at all times. That way if your stuff gets stolen or lost, you'll have a way to call your contacts for a way out. I always keep a calling card on me when traveling.

When traveling in sketchy areas, keep your credit cards & some cash in your shoe or sock. Also for sketchy areas, never get in a taxi that you haven't called for. Never tell a stranger where you're staying.

If you'll be traveling through areas without cell reception I highly recommend getting a SPOT device. If your car breaks down you can have the SPOT send a pre-set custom message & your current location to your emergency contacts with something like, "Hey my car broke down, can you call the nearest towing company to my location?"

Also, get a full size spare tire. I just learned that lesson this weekend - got a flat 100 miles from town with no cell reception, and the manual said to only drive on the spare tire for 45 miles. Whoops...

I've read about some women using entry alarms when staying in places with iffy locks on the door or windows. [Here's an example.](http://www.amazon.com/Window-Entry-Alarm-Magnetic-Sensor/dp/B008NXFKLK/ref=pd_sim_hi_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=1QTE7FS1KR13EHEV8W1Q) Although if you're traveling with a dog that should work too!

Stay safe and have an awesome time!
