I just want to second this. I love that my girlfriend "overreacts" to unwelcome approaches that don't get the hint and doesn't mind looking "crazy" when situations like that get uncomfortable.  Those _particular_ people deserve what they got and those that whine, second handily on the internet, about their hypothetical feelings can fuck right off. 

Loved-ones' **safety** is what matters, whiners can get over their daydreams.
