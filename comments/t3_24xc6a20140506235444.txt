If those animals are trapped, this is animal cruelty and the police should be called. Did they pour cement into the hole?! Who the fuck does that? Cats are smart. I feel like the cats probably scattered and afraid to return.

I have no other advice except maybe try to postpone your exam. If you're an otherwise good student, it might be okay. Then again, if you've been a good student, you might do well on your exam if you can pull it together for an hour. 

In your shoes, I'd be a mess, too. It sounds like extreme anxiety. I've had it. I've been there. Anyone have any klonopin or Xanex nearby?
