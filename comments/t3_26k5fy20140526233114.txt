While I do not condone their behavior in any way, did you honestly expect Playboy to be treating women like equals to men? Objectification of women literally runs their business. If you go to Playboy looking for actual meaningful stories and articles I'm afraid you've gone to the wrong magazine. (Edit: My grammar has been very poor today.)
