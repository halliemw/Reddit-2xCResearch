I'm of the opinion that 'emotional cheating' is only a thing in the sense that there are things that I could do that would hurt my SO, and things I could do that wouldn't, and I should probably avoid the former.

Whenever I get feelings like yours that I'm just not certain about, I like to play a little thought experiment, start playing with some of the variables and see how my feelings about the situation change.

For example; assuming your fiance is a straight man, and not bisexual, would you still feel the same way if this mutual friend of yours was a man?  Why or why not?  It might help you get to the bottom of why you feel the way you do.
