You are not a horrible person, please do not beat yourself up! You are doing what you feel you need to do for yourself and doing what you feel is best for your unborn child. It would be horribly selfish to bring an unwanted child into the world knowing you cannot afford and do not want it. You are doing what you know is right and being mature enough to chose the right thing for you, it is no ones business what you do or why you do it, you owe no explanations, reasons, excuses etc.

You have been given links to Planned Parenthood and advice on calling them, my advice is also the same. I am in the Central Wisconsin area (smack dab in the middle) should you find your funding and need a ride I will be here for you if you need me.

Stay strong and hang in there, this is not going to be an easy road but you can do this no matter what you chose. *hugs*
