I'm not familiar with this company, but this just really odd to me because Mayim Bialik is attractive also. Amy Farrah Fowler is such a crowd favorite, and many nerdy girls identify with her, so this was really stupid from a marketing standpoint also. 

Not every geeky girl aspires to be a sexpot. For many of us just being ourselves is enough, and that's why Amy is such an awesome character! They're trying to make it seem like  no matter how hard you try you will still look like this loser, when the 'loser' is in fact a respected figure (albeit a made up one) for many. FAIL.
