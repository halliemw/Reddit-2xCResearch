NO. And I never said that. I think you obviously can draw lines. I don't think OP mentioned that he is anti-choice. He just doesn't want this abortion because its his potential-kid. And he had sex with her with the understanding that if pregnancy happened, so would an abortion.

I think he is within his rights to end the relationship. I just also think the right/good/menschy thing to do is to be supportive for this one last part of that relationship.
