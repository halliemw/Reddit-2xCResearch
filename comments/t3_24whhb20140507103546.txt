It isn't necessarily the end for them. It is an ultimatum. People really need to get over the use of that word. His opinion changed on the matter, and if hers do they'll stay together. That is all he's saying regardless of the negative spin you want to put on it. You can't possibly know his exact phrasing, and relying on OP's paraphrasing to tear him down is bullshit. OP's boyfriend doesn't have to phrase reality in some oddly twisted manner to appease OP. It's not like you put a euphemism on "abortion". This is called a dealbreaker. Being straightforward with it is much better than the alternative. 

He's not "trying to influence her" unless you think he'll stick around post-abortion. He's being honest. Hell, it might even sadden him that this will break them up, but it is as real as OP not wanting the child.
