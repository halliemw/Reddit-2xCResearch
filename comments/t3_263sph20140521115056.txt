I have been fighting the same thing for the past few years, so I know how awful they can be.  Internet hugs to you!  

I have found cranberry pills, probiotics, and lots of water do help to prevent some of them.  However, I still need antibiotics to clear infections now and then and have been put on a prophylactic antibiotic as well.  

My advice is get to a good Urologist or OBGYN that has a lot of experience treating recurring infections.  If you go to your family doctor or urgent care  place, make them do a culture of your urine each time you get an infection so you are sure to get the best drug to fight the infection and clear it.  Also, be sure to get treatment for any yeast infections that may result from the antibiotic treatment as this can spur new bacterial infections.  Experiment with other sexual positions in order to minimize friction against your urethra area.  Most of all, keep experimenting to find what works best for your body.  Good luck!
