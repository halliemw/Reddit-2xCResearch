It wasn't super cute of a story. 

We were laying and watching a movie and he kissed my neck. I hadn't really kissed before (I kissed a guy once a few years prior when I had just turned 17) but I just kind of rolled to face him and kissed him back. 

We went to his room for privacy (his housemate was on the computer), because I didn't want to be making out with him in the room. 

I think the roommate knew it was gonna happen. 

Around 3 days after, and many more kisses, we decided to be a couple.
