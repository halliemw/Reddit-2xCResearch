When it comes to overt sexual violence (rape for example), I would agree with you.  However, this peer-reviewed article focuses on the more subtle ways that children are accepting harassment and negative touching. Some of the quotes from the girls they interviewed makes me sick to my stomach...to think they are having this happen, and thinking it is normal.  It is about the perspective of the children, not adults.
