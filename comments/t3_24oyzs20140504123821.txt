I think this hits home for anyone who is considered a "fetish" by virtue of existing. Strange as it may sound you share this problem with the trans community as well.

Generally the types that are attracted to you purely because you fulfill their shallow fetishistic desires are dangerous and to be avoided at all times, but it can be hard to explain why it is bad that this person sees you as a sex-thing first and a human maybe.
