You're a really great person! And your daughter is too! It's a good thing you convinced her to go to a therapist, it really does wonders, yet so many people dismiss it and see it as a weakness, when it's one of the strongest things to do. It helps with depression, anxiety, low self-confidence and also, you learn to build better relations with people. I've been going for the past 6 months and my views are completely different than before, and so is my self-confidence.

My day was already great, but you made it even better with this post! It's really rare these days to read about good things on reddit. And this also made me realize how much I need to hug my own mom right now (\^_\^)
