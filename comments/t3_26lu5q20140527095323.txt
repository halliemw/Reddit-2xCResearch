I don't have the skinny drive - discipline, beer is just too good and perogies and these ridiculously over priced chocolate chip cookies from the french place by my work. Yeah see! I'm 5'3 and about 9 1/2 stone and I carry it mostly in my butt and hips and stuff. Sometimes I love it and feel so curvy a la kim kardashian and other times I wish I could be a health nut and get all toned up. I ultimately know that I'd rather be chubbier/curvier and happy and enjoying all the things I like to enjoy than be obsessing over food and be thinner. But it's hard some days! I relate soo much here. But you're right, balance is totally key.
