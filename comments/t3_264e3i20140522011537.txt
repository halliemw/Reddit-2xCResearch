Real periods follow ovulation by 2 weeks, but not all vaginal bleeding is a period. Sometimes women get uterine bleeding that is more like a nosebleed than the cyclical release of the uterine lining.

You can determine if you've ovulated by testing for elevated progesterone levels. Saliva tests for progesterone are just as good as a blood test. If you are not ovulating, you can simulate a menstrual cycle with supplemental Progesterone USP, which is the same molecule as what the body makes for itself.
