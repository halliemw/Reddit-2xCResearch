That really is a disgusting response. A 14-year-old girl being blamed for the actions of a 27-year-old man? Can none of these people remember being 14? I'm still far too trusting at 25. I wouldn't know if I'd been given alcohol at 14. I'm impressed for her getting out of there and calling her mom. His actions are inexcusable regardless of anything, she is a very unfortunate victim, and they are victim-blaming. I really wouldn't want to associate with any of them.
