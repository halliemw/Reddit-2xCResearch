Thank you for posting this. Im sure it was difficult to put this out there. My situation is similar and Ive been driving myself crazy because I cant get what happened out of my head. Its affecting everything I do and even my current relationship.  When we go out we are so trusting with friends to pick up on things that dont feel right.... in my case, my supposed friends are taking his side. They told me to suck it up and deal with it. Unfortunately, because it was somebody I knew and considered family, it took me a while to report it. In that I think I have sealed my fate that he will never be held accountable. I hope they are able to find this guy and keep it from happening to anyone else .
