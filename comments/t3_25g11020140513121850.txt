As a women of color I find this article as racists, sexist, and bigoted. It perpetuates the victim-hood complex. You want something in life go and build it. I run a small successful business, no one has ever gotten in my way other than my competitors, which is what they should be doing as I also get in their way. This article is another woe-is-me rant. Then you wonder why others might not want to take us seriously because our "self-appointed" representatives like to write such terrible articles such as these. The author is perpetuating the stereotype that everyone else other than white men are weak. People have to worry about our sensitive feelings, we're not able to compete in this world even if we try. Boo hoo hoo, the big scary white man is the reason for all of my problems. This article is absolutely racist garbage.
