>But really, the guy's just fucking messed up. HE is just messed up, and HE is the problem.

Actually, he's a symptom. He's a result. He's a heart attack that was caused by a partially blocked artery.

The problem is the aforementioned community and its siblings, and the poisonous beliefs they promote. And those stem from the general idea promoted by everything that women are objects. It's the feeling of entitlement that comes with it. If women are objects, they can't have any kind of autonomy in choices, especially not in those who go against a man's wishes.

Self-proclaimed "nice guys" still too often get incredibly angry when they're rejected, and that's exactly the same entitlement. Women are starting to see that now, and that's even scarier than a guy who's an outright misogynist. Advice to the actual nice guys? Stop saying you're one. Just be a nice guy. That includes accepting rejection if it comes, and not feeling entitled to a girl's body because you've been nice.

If you think you're owed anything for being nice, you're not being nice. You're trying to trick someone into a transaction.
