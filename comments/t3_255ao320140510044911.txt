Haha yes the exact same thing happened constantly to my blonde cousins in India! Although sometimes they would tag-team with a friend who would be standing waaaaay in front of us with a camera, so they would actually get the photo and (presumably) be like, "oh yes, this is a picture of my... uh, girlfriend and I... taken from very far away."
