Extremely powerful. A job well done to these poets!
What I love about this was that the blame for rape culture was neither put on the victim (which it never should), nor was it solely put on a single rapist. Rape culture (emphasis on the culture) is not just about rapist,. it's the environment in which these acts are formed, nourished, cultivated, and spread. It not only encompasses rapists and sexual abusers, but also schools that teach that "boys will be boys" or ad campaigns showing how easy it is to objectify a woman and change her from a human being to a beer can. Rape is unforgivable, and it is our responsibility as human beings, no matter gender, race, or creed, to help end rape. It is our responsibility to treat our fellow humans with respect, but it is our responsibility to foster an environment where education and support come before socialized sexism and objectification. It's a culture much larger than just rapists, it's a socialized order and industry at it's most general level. I love that this poem helps explain that a little.
