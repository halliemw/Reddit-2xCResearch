Your post got me to actually sign in which is rare.  

Ok, so you say he isn't 100% responsible for his actions.  I think that is bullshit.   Let me ask you this.  If this same man actually went as far as raping you, would you feel he was responsible then?  Or, even if no matter what people tell you, you still feel he isn't actually 100% responsible does that make it ok?  Is it ok for him to go around killing people if he isn't 100% responsible? No.  It is not, just like it is not ok for him to assault you sexually or otherwise. 

If it were me, I would go make a formal complaint right now.  This sounds like it need to be dealt with on a more serious level or things may get worse.  I have a feeling that if you hear a couple of weeks from now that this guy raped a younger girl or anyone at all you are going to feel more guilt than you will know what to do with.  

Someone who is willing to rub themselves in public and then fondle the genitals of someone they don't even know is dangerous.  It may be something that can be taught and it won't be an issue again or it may be something that the caregiver needs to be aware of so they can control the actions and supervision of this individual.

I guess what I am trying to say is, whether he was 100% responsible or not is irrelevant.  There is a real problem here and it needs to be dealt with seriously by his guardian before it gets worse or just continues.
