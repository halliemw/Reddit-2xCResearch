This was my experience as well. When I got to university—and moved to a new city and stopped being financially dependent on my parents and didn't have to see the same people in the halls every day—it was like a whole new world and I was so much happier.

That said, I do wish I tried more things at 16-ish, back when everyone was an amateur at everything (even though they all seemed so much more experienced ..somehow). And I wish I had focused more on developing friendships that by now could've been pretty long-term. But in ten years I'll probably be saying similar stuff about what I should have done at the age I am now – the opportunities and challenges are just different.
