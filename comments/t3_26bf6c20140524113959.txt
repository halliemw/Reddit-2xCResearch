I've experienced more sexism than I could ever begin to remember... It takes form mostly in cat calls, honking at me while I walk, creeping me on the bus, and of course my first sexual relationship at 15 resulted in many, many instances of rape. I am very aware of it now and do my best to keep my head held high, but it certainly makes you feel less than human when it happens so often. I hope those women who have never experienced it never will.
