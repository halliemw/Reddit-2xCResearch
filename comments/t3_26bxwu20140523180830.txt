I am sorry for your experience, as a guy, I find it very annoying to know that this is how a lot dudes are.  I was with a very beautiful girlfriend, and I consistently see guys just staring and undressing her with their eyes, but since she was with me, they knew to keep their mouths shut.  I just don't get why jerks act like that toward woman, as if it really works for picking up women.  Those aren't men, they are immature little boys that try to act tough in front of their loser friends, and they are just pissed because no one wants them.  Keep your head up, and ignore them, maybe carry some mace or a switch blade for protection.
