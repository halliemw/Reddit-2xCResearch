Ugh. That is the worst. I've had this happen to me while by sitting by myself at a bar on several occasions...despite my efforts to seem as unapproachable as possible (bitchface activated, obsessively playing with my phone). I remember one asshole who thought it'd be cute to lean over me and start aggressively poking at my phone, then when I recoiled and told him to back off,  put his hand on my thigh 

My personal favorite, though, has got to be "what's a girl like you doing here by yourself?" Ummm... I AM AN ADULT?! I didn't realize I needed a fucking chaperone.
