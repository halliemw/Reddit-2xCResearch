Can I ask a dumb question? I've never been an 8 year old boy... but I thought that you didn't get erections that young. 

I'm aware that rape and sexual assault don't have to involve an erect penis... but I guess I'm pondering how this is even physically possible. 

And then I'm wondering who molested these two kids to the point that they are trying to normalize the behavior.
