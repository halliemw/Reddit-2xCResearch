In India they use squat toilets and sometimes have western style toilets as well. When backpacking, I always chose the squats, because even though both toilets were equally dirty, the squats were easier to stay away from the dirt with. Much easier then hovering over a dirty western style toilet seat.

I came back wishing all public toilets everywhere were squats.
