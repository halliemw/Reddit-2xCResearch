I've had 2 yeast infections and 1 UTI in the past 6 months and naturally it has frightened me. Echoing all the other advice here, I pee before sex, drink water right before so I'll be ready to pee after. I also take cranberry suppliments daily and eat probiotic organic yoghurt with manuka honey every morning. So far, so good!
