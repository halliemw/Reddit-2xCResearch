Wow, the comments in this thread are rough. Is TwoX still a default sub? This place reeks of /r/all right now.

The uterus is not sexual, unless you count some kind of weird Rule 34 fetish. How many times have you heard someone say "Damn, that chick has a really fucking hot uterus, I wanna get me some of that"? Probably never. There's really no need to start wringing hands and wailing "But think of the children!!" Any child who is old enough to recognize a stylized image of a uterus has probably attended sex ed or at least had "the talk" with their parents...otherwise it would just look like a picture of an alien or something to them.

That said, I'm not sure if a graduation is the best case to showcase political beliefs. I'm 100% pro-choice, but an event like a graduation is supposed to be a fairly solemn and neutral setting. I'd be pretty annoyed if I saw someone wearing an "Abortion is murder" logo on their graduation cap, so by the same token, I don't think a pro-choice message is appropriate in that situation. Just my two cents.
