> How do you feel about depriving your child from growing up with their relatives? 

I think this part may have bothered some people. Though some children may "long to make contact with their birth parents," that doesn't mean that the child is deprived of having relatives. And, technically speaking, this particular child WILL have birth parents/gestational parents, so it's not the same as adopting a child who was "given up" by his birth mother. She isn't a birth mother; she is a genetic donor. 

And what she did was really fucking awesome.
