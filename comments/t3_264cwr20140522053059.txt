Sorry, "jokes" do reflect a person's thoughts, innocuous or not. He wouldn't make jokes poking fun at women unless he spent his time entertaining thoughts that they are inferior. 

I would say it's *roughly*, roughly analogous to how a comedian's routines grow more and more about airplanes/hotels/travel as they become more famous.
