I have a bad habit of forming my own opinion before I've taken everything into account. 
So I re-read her post and I did skim over the part where said SO is talking about "when we have kids" etc.

Sorry, OP. :/ This actually does suck and it seems like they had talked about it at least intermittently. The possibility of children freaks people out. Talking hypothetical situations and then BEING in that situation are totally different. Leading her to think that he's okay with having a child isn't cool. Maybe he IS okay with having a child - just not right now.

Since he neglected to cover his bases and put a condom on, she's stuck holding the bag. It seems like she's already made her choice and that's good. My advice would be, pregnant or not, evaluate wether or not the relationship is worth salvaging. Lack of communication is still a huge culprit, and that's a lot to work on.
