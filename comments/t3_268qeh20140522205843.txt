Believe it or not - this is an awesome opportunity for you!

Get the CEO and COO to give you written recommendations on your linkedin profile.  

FIle for unemployment IMMEDIATELY.

Get with your county's local workforce office to help with the job search.

Hit the gym - get those endorphins flowing!    

Learn something new - see if there is a certification you qualify for now.  

Volunteer - make the world a better place.  You can do this in your field.  

Soak in a hot tub filled with bubbly and relax. 


No job is ever as loyal to you as you should be to yourself.  You learned a lot and got a lot of wonderful experience AND got terrific title for your resume (the only title that counts is that final one).

Start sending out resumes and only apply for jobs that give you a 10% raise.

You can do this!!
