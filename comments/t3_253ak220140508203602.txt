Sorry to hear this.  It's hard to imagine there are so many rude people that you can't even leave your house.  What is that bothers you about what people say?  I understand sometimes someone might say something so crude, it's impossible to ignore, but the one thing you can definitely control is how it makes you feel.  If you can get to the bottom of what bothers you about it, maybe you can learn to change it.

Failing that, a nice pair of ear buds might render you pleasantly oblivious.
