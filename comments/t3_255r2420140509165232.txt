[My boyfriend just gave me a baseball charm just now](http://m.imgur.com/rAzsWFm) so I have 14 total and 2 clips (the 2 beside the pink beads). 4 of them (the 2 pink beads, the sparkly purple bead, and the folks blue bead) are actually beads from Kay. Most of the others are gifts, but the clips and a few of the beads I bought on ebay! Just make sure they're authentic (all Pandora beads have an ALE stamp).
