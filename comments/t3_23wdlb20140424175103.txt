Ah, well, let's pack it all up then. Clearly, since other countries which I have no control over have it worse, I'd better stop caring about things going on in America. I mean, duh, how could I have been so stupid. 

Also, yesterday I took my friend to the doctor because he might have strep throat, but since he clearly doesn't have terminal brain cancer, I really should have just let him and his fever chill out at home, right? I was sort of hungry today so I had lunch, but man, there's starving kids in Africa, so it was actually really pointless and stupid of me to get myself food when I'm not literally starving to death, you know.
