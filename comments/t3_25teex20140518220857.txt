>Other formulations (two types of pills, the ring) haven't given me the same problem. I'm on the ring now and have been very satisfied with the lack of side effects. 

I'm tentatively hopeful about the ring. That is one thing I haven't tried just yet. However, I've tried softcups for menstrual periods, and if the ring is anything like those, I'm not sure if I will be comfortable with it. 

>Many antidepressants lower libido (an issue that caused me to change to a different antidepressant), and so can BC.

This is also a concern of mine. When I'm depressed, everything goes out the window. I have no desire whatsoever. The pills I've been on have made me feel terrible, so my sex drive has been nonexistent, and so I feel even more terrible about it. It's an awful cycle.

>Unless your doctor says otherwise, it might be best to work on one of the types of medication first until you're satisfied with a formulation and dose, and then work on the other.

The problem right now is finding a pill that won't make me feel like I want to jump off a cliff. With previous pills, that feeling didn't settle in until later. The first couple months would be fine, and I could deal with any usual minor depression symptoms without any issue. 4-6 months in, I would be a total wreck.

The pill that I just quit made me feel so erratically different and numb that I couldn't take it anymore. That one was also 4 months. I'm not sure if it's my body becoming immune to... whatever? Because it feels like a switch was flipped, and then I want to not exist anymore.
