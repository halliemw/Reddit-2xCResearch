Thanks for sharing. Made me tear up. This is my first Mothers Day without my mom. She passed away 1 month before my 26th birthday. She was 47. It's really hard. My younger sister just graduated college yesterday and It was very emotional. I'm engaged as well and that, and the implications of it, is very hard as well. Happy Mothers Day to the only woman that I ever called "momma" and the only one that I ever will. <3
