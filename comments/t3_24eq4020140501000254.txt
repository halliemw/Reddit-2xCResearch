If it helps, in the first trimester your uterus is still behind your pelvis, it hasn't risen upwards and outwards yet so the kick in the stomach sucks but is unlikely to harm the foetus. Food wise, I was amazed at the things my American pregnant friends were expected to avoid versus what I in Germany wasn't supposed to have or do. And my SiL in Paris: her list suggested cutting down on alcohol and cigarettes as far as possible, and avoiding foie gras and predator fish. I think as someone capable of critical thinking you can assess the risks for yourself. Good luck!
