>It's not a good example of a joke, because it's sort of a meta-joke... a commentary on conventional punchlines.

First of all it's a perfectly fine example of a joke. A joke is a joke regardless of who finds it funny (it was also the only one I could come up with for some reason).

>The assumption of shared bigotry works in a very similar way as these much more basic examples of shared knowledge. Thank you for illustrating the point precisely.

It's just intellectually dishonest is all, as is changing my point to make yours.

I mean most of your point here is that shared knowledge is required for a joke to be funny. And that's true, though incredibly obvious. You can't find something funny if you don't understand what I am saying to begin with. The dishonesty, which is what I was pointing out and which you ignored, comes from the logical leap required to conflate knowledge with consensus. Knowing about something does **not** mean you agree with it.
