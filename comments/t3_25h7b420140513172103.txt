I don't think that not having universal healthcare is a war on women or anything, though I feel differently about defunding family planning initiatives which are proven to save the government money in the long run. I do think it disproportionately affects women, because of this whole pregnancy thing.

As for the differences between Britain and Canada and Iceland, I think that is more likely to be a lifestyle issue. Iceland has an obesity rate around half of the British and Canadian obesity rates, while the American obesity rate is only around 20% higher than the British or Canadian ones. I'd also like to point out that a single payer system actually results in cheaper healthcare costs because it gives the government negotiating power that individual people don't have. 

Healthcare is already a right. People who show up at the emergency room already receive care, regardless of their ability to pay, and you already pay for their healthcare except you're paying it at a much higher rate than you would if the government were able to negotiate the prices. In fact, your take home pay very well might increase because what you pay in taxes to cover healthcare would likely be less than what you pay in health insurance now. It doesn't have to be an unsustainable system and it doesn't have to be unaffordable. Realistically, it could create a little room to increase taxes to cover some of the deficit without decreasing the average American's net income. If we do it right, we save money.
