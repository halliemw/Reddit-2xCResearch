Older guy chiming in.


Almost everyone has some type of hobby or interest that may seem to be going overboard for occasionally.  


With that out of the way the biggest issue is this...


> This is money he sets aside from his paycheck plus he has taken out two loans against his 401k.


To me this means that his hobby is beyond what he's able to save and plan for.  Unless you've got some huge life changing event, the 401k is the holy of holiest.  His behavior with it is reckless.
