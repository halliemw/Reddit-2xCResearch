I just checked out their site. I was interested until I saw this:

> All functions of the female body are harshly controlled and regulated by patriarchy.

Maybe I'm just sucked into the system but I don't think that applies to me. I'm not saying there isn't some element of that, especially when you consider things like this: https://humanism.org.uk/2014/05/08/bha-condemns-high-court-decision-ban-northern-irish-women-receiving-abortions-nhs-england/ 

I know in many parts of the world women are less fortunate, but I am turned off by something that doesn't appear to strive for integrity and truthfulness.
