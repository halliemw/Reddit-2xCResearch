Whoa, you need to switch neighborhoods/cities. I've lived in a ton of places around the Twin cities, and some are way worse than others. I can't go for a walk through some parts of Frogtown, along Lake street, or in North without stuff like that happening, but if I'm in Uptown, parts of NE, Powderhorn, Seward, Summit/Grand in St Paul, or around the lakes it is way better. Still get the occasional drive by, but if you are living in a community that is more supportive of women in general it's much better and feels safer.
