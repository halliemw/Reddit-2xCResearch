Respectfully, I disagree that this issue shouldn't raise concerns of how pervasive misogyny is in western society. Racism is related to misogyny so its honestly unsurprising he was also racist. We, as a collection of societies known as "the west" have been long overdue for addressing some of these incredibly serious concerns - that misogyny does in fact result in endemic violence against women.  

I agree that the United States also needs to seriously address their gun culture. I am Australian though, and we've had successful gun laws for about a decade now. I don't understand why America doesn't follow suit when it clearly works. 

However, what I am most concerned about is his being autistic. I haven't read anywhere in the news that he was officially diagnosed with a mental illness/was on the autistic spectrum. Do you have a source for this?
