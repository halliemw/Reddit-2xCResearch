My ma's a nurse.  I hear stories all the time.  You would not believe the *stunning* degree of apathy some people in the profession have.  The other day one of my mum's coworkers made the completely serious argument that she shouldn't have to bother bringing a patient life-sustaining medication because "She's 84 years old, so it's not like it makes much difference."  I stress that this was not some extraordinary life-saving measure like CPR, this was a human being arguing in earnest that another human being should be allowed to die just so that she wouldn't have to get off her ass long enough to deliver a paper cup full of pills.
