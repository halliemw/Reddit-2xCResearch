I can honestly say I don't think I had any concept of trans genders until I was in college. Lived on a small island with very strong roman catholic oversight. We had barely passable sex ed. 

When I learned about gender neutrality everything in my world suddenly made sense. I don't need to fit in a gender binary. Years of feeling broken (or being brushed off as a tomboy) made sense!
