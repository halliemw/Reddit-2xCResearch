I feel your pain. I have very fair skin and dark hair growth everywhere because of PCOS. Right now [my hairy arms](http://i.imgur.com/t8Da7Ip.jpg) are making me really self conscious. I keep thinking maybe I will wax them but at the same time, I shouldn't have to feel like I have to. 

My face is probably the place where it bothers me the most as it is the most visible to strangers from day to day. I hope someday to have laser hair removal on my face to cut down on the ongoing fight against lady beard but for now, I just spend a lot of time plucking out dark hairs and waxing my upper lip.
