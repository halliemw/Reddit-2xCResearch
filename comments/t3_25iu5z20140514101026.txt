Some people are not into hookups and that's okay. If it makes you feel bad, just learn from it and move on. It's not a huge deal.

As for the guy you yearn for, eight years is not that big of an age gap and if you like him so much perhaps you should see if he's interested in getting together.

You say you don't want a serious committed relationship but it sounds a bit like you do want a relationship. At the very least, if hookups with strangers aren't for you don't beat yourself up about it. Based on myself and all of my friends, nobody I know uses Tinder or is into one-night stands, and I know a lot of people who had that realization after an experience like you had. Move on and get the most out of college while you're there!
