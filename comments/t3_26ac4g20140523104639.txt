I just want to point out that people who have this view ("why don't women also have to lift 100 pounds?") tend to miss the point of testing physical requirements. These tests are designed to determine physical fitness, which differs between men and women. Physically fit people should be able to do these jobs regardless of whether or not they lift.

There's a bestof post about this from a while back.
