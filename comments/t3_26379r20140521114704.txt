Lovely article, and very refreshing.  I'm not black, so can't comment on the specific racial issues faced by those who are.  But I am brown, with dark skin and black hair.  And I'm happy with that.  I've never wanted to have lighter skin or blonde hair.  Even if my family back in India has told me I should stay out of the sun!  In some ways its even more surprising because I grew up in a very, very white part of the US.  Just lucky I guess.
