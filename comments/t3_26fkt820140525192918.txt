I work with older folks. Sometimes dirty old men take it a little too far. I always try to resolve it myself, first. "Hey, that is NOT appropriate." Second time is, "Excuse me, I asked you to stop that." Third time is, "I think you'd do well to talk with my manager."

Don't use the "I have a boyfriend" line. That tells him, "this would be OK if I was single." You need to state, firmly, that it's not ok simply because IT IS NOT OK. It's not ok WITH YOU. 

You're not being mean, you are showing that you have respect for yourself. Don't be mean to YOU!
