I am not butthurt, And I don't feel my post conveys such a vibe. I have to put up with casual sexism daily so I'm plenty used to it. And I'd be a fool not to expect it in here-  female dominated communities are incubators for sexism the same as male dominated communities are. 

I understand where the bitterness comes from, I feel the dark taint try to grow within whenever a woman (or man) mistreats me for my gender. But I do my utmost to ensure it does not change who I am. We can't choose the dogs that live in our brains, but we can choose which ones we feed.

As for the studies you mention, I agree they sound like complete nonsense, And they are easily debunked without having to resort to sexism. I did not (and did not state thus) that I discounted the rest of her post (I'm sure you've guessed by now I am a scientist), instead I pointed out that most people would. am sure if I opened this post by telling you to "shut up and make me a sandwich" you would discount most if not all of my following statement. 

Even if this wasn't true, IDGAF it's sexism and it hasn't added anything to her post. I treat women equally, with equal culpability and equal responisibility.

It's important to me because I feel that one of the biggest issues holding back feminism is the rampant sexism that is allowed to go unchecked within, and I don't want my neice or nephew to face the discrimination that I and my sister have experianced for years. 

I Hope this clarifies my prior post.
