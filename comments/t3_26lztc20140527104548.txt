Something that I have witnessed as a guy, perhaps it's more common with younger people, is that women treat their female friends way different then guys treat their male friends.

Two girls or women that are friends will be very expressive, they'll hug, they'll style each other's hair, they'll even sit on each other's lap.
Now two guys that are friends will just drink beer and shout while watching a ball game. They won't be expressive, they won't be touchy, they certainly won't be sentimental (or will be so very rarely).

So a woman that wants to be friends with a guy and "assert the boundaries" should understand that there is a cultural gap between how friendship is understood by the two sexes. It doesn't necessarily mean that the only friendship she could have with a guy is one where they attend games or talk about guy stuff in a guy way. But she also can't be as expressive with the guy friend as she is with her female friends, because guys would misread that as something more than friendship.


Of course everything I said might be wrong and sexist, I'm not sure.
