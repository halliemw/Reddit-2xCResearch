What do we do to verify the women that are asking for rides, places to crash, are legitimate requests?

I.e. what if some crazy pro-lifers use this to harass people who are trying to help women?

Edit: I think this will work best if we work with clinics that have these names on file. So at least we know they are scheduled for an abortion. Then the clinics can call on behalf of the women if the women want to.
