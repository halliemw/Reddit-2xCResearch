From this subreddit's description (emphasis mine):
>Welcome to TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and *intended for women's perspectives.* 

As I stated in my post description, I like to keep my reddit participation gender neutral.  So, I completely agree with you that if a comment is valid, then gender is irrelevant.  However, this sub is specifically intended for women's perspective.  It says so on the description.  When I come here, I want to get the perspective of other women.  

I think men can contribute to this sub, and have done so before.  A lot of men, in the past, would preface their comments with "As a man..." because they understood that most member of 2XC were female.  This will no longer be the case and I believe that the *women's perspective* aspect of this sub will be lost.
