FDR (freedomain radio) is something akin to a cult. Other quotable mentions from their leader include the following:

"Children are infinite slaves of their parents."

"I know that not lots of parents kill or maim their children but thatâ€™s only because children comply."

He also provides 'evidence' to support the above mentioned quotes, so yes I think that video is bias the same way that occasional post from the read pill makes a valid point but is so smothered in bullshit that the entire argument needs to be dissected and systematically evaluated line by line.
