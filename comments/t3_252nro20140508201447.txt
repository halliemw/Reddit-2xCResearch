The funny thing is, the no-makeup look often uses just as much makeup as an obviously done up face does... it just uses neutral and natural tones. I subscribe to makeupaddiction and you wouldn't believe the length of the product lists to achieve a "natural" no makeup look! For me it goes back to the idea of women having to straddle the line. Be the innocent virgin, but be perfect in bed. Don't wear too much makeup, but don't forget to look perfect.
