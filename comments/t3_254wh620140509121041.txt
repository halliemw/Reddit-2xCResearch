I'm not actually sure. I initially thought going default was a *horrible* decision. I'm still not persuaded it was a good decision. But what I'm angry about is how the mods failed to communicate about the change in an organized way, or offer the community here any organized way to voice opinions. Basically my impression at this point is that they are unprepared or uninterested in giving 2X a way to influence this decision.

They also routinely ignore direct questions, and don't address concerns with any specific discussion of the issue posed. Look at the response above. That's pretty much what's gone out to every concern raised.
