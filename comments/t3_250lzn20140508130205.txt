There's really no need for the tone, I understood your distinction completely, though it seems you didn't bother with mine. The video addresses whether or not rapes in situations including drunken nights out can be prevented at all by taking the measures you listed and comparing them with testimony from convicted serial rapists and statistics. It does not say that no crime is preventable. If you can't even be bothered to listen to a differing opinion, I don't see why *yours* should be taken seriously at all. 

Furthermore, I brought up that the majority of rapes occur by acquaintances because, if in fact the "preventable rape" number is so small, why is it that all women should forgo the same personal freedoms that men enjoy because of a small threat of rape? Wearing a short dress is not the same as flashing $2000, maybe walking naked down an alley at 2am is, but no woman does that. We *already* take measures not to attract rapists. The video is interesting, and even handed, with sources listed. There's nothing else I can say if you're going to make judgements before you listen to what you're judging.
