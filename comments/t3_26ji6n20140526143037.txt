I know you're seeking advice from women, but I just have to say (as others have noted) that there are clearly other issues with this guy than just the age difference.

That said, I recently had a year-long relationship with a woman 25 years my junior. If you'd like my perspective on how she elegantly ended our relationship, ask and I'll be happy to respond.
