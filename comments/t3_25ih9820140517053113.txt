I ended up finding it, but before I did, I just borrowed a corresponding pill from my new pack, with the hopes of finding the one I dropped. I have looked into other forms, it's not that I don't remember to take it everyday, it's just annoying but honestly, it's the best option for me because I like the predictable periods, with other methods, from what I've heard, never really seems to get the periods down like clockwork as the pill does. I am also not a fan of having to insert something "up there" and as far as an IUD I'm not a fan of having to check it's still in place, and I hate going in for even a pap smear, so I don't need anyone needing to go in there more frequently than I need to...the shot I hear is horrible and if you have bad side effects, you have to wait until it wears off...the patch....sensitive skin and I don't want to worry about people somehow seeing it or it being uncomfortable.
