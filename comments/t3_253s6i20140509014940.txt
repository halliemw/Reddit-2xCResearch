Didn't have a baby but i had pain med for a simple day surgery that kept me bung up for two weeks i was too high to notice.


I gave birth to three little but nuggets poops.  It took 6 hours, i wasnt sure if i should call the doctors.... and my ass hurt so much I had to lay on my stomach!!


I can only fucking imagine what you went though! !
