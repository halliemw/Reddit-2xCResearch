I've had a couple friendships like that.  They were with people who I ended up distancing myself from because they were engaging in patterns that weren't healthy, and it was ultimately too draining to worry about them.  Other than that, it was pretty excellent.

For another take on it, just read some of Jaime Hernandez's "Maggie and Hopey" comics :)  (don't take them too seriously, they're just a great portrait of intense relationships).
