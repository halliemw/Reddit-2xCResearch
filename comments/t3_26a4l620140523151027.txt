These are definitely the questions that I asked right off the bat! Why was he not thinking about our relationship, why was our relationship not paramount in that situation? Just why?

But since then, I think it's easy for me to push those questions aside because I don't want to hear the answer. But it is something that absolutely has to be addressed before thinking of staying together. He is going to see a counselor for a few sessions, and I'm hoping that he can come to a realization about why, and what our relationship really means to him.
