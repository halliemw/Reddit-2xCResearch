A whistle? I don't care. A compliment? Don't mind, may put a smile on my face. A compliment that's rather sexual in nature? Makes me uncomfortable and annoyed. A sexual compliment and irritability and/or presistance when I' not all yeah-lets-fuck? Makes me angry and makes me think about how to deal with the situation.

What always bothered me was how lots of catcalls were from significantly older men on my 13-year old self. That shit was embarrassing, scary and made me feel dirty and disgusting. I doubt many teenage girls want to hear "C'mon baby, lift that skirt... I wanna fuck you so bad!" from a fat and bald 50 something guy....
