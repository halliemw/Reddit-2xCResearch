I agree with you and I also took this quote

> Women are always being told to change or be different -- lose weight, fight aging, smooth your skin, get rid of cellulite, I mean really, women are such amazing and dynamic creatures can we please change the conversation from this bullsh*t to something with a little more substance

to not be talking about health and looking after yourself, but more talking about the media in general. Why is the obsession always on looks? Why is it the thing we are taught to value more than anything else? Our bodies aren't who we are. Our interests, passions, relationships with others, intellect, etc should be valued more than what we look like. 

That's what I took from that quote anyway.
