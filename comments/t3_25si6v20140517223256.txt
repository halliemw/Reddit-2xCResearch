This is exactly why I like reading TwoX and would like to interact. As a man (a white, young man at that), I don't have any idea what women feel or how they experience daily events. Reading this sub, therefore, is an interesting study into how the other half lives, and at times it helps me reflect on personal experiences in a different light. I may not be able to empathize, and I'll never understand what it's like to be a woman, and so I don't comment much, but that doesn't mean I can't be interested. 

Does it help if I provide a disclaimer first? That way you can just skip by the comment if you're not interested in a male point of view. I'd hate to stop interacting on the sub completely, but then again this sub isn't for me, so maybe I should?
