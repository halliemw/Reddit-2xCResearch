Very, very interesting.

As a random guy, I have been in this situation before. I understand where this guy is coming from. I understand his pain. His pain is (or was) my pain - not enough "closure". 

But as I read the comments here, a lot of what you all are saying makes a lot of sense too. 

Hard for me to reconcile this. Maybe I am a narcissist (if so, is that "bad"? Feeling confused). Maybe there is no closure. Maybe any attempt at closure if it could be had would never be enough. Maybe I don't even know what I really want - all I know is that I hurt and I want it to stop. 

I am going to have to give this some further thought.
