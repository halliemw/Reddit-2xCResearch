haha, your questions are welcome!

The stone I think is ~~somekind of cubic zirconia~~ Hessian garnet, and the metal is silver. He sculpted it from PMC (precious metal clay) and the stone is sculpted right into it. He chose the stone because it would withstand the temperatures it takes for the clay. The design and colour does not really have any special significance beyond that he thought I would like it. I love it!

His shed has a whole plethora of tools, not really jewelry specific but more miniature making specific. In fact, he has had very little experience with jewelrymaking so I am double triple impressed.

His face when he gave it to me was the cutest thing. We're long distance, across the atlantic long distance and I had spent 3 months over there and he gave this to me the day before I left. I miss him terribly already and it's only been 4 days :c
