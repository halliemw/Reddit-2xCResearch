Exactly.  "Real men don't buy girls" is attacking the monstrous actions of a select group of men.  Choices that men made.  It's directly related to the character, as you said, of the person in question.  It's targeting and attacking people who, honestly, deserve to be attacked.

"Real women have curves" is attacking a physical body type, and has nothing to do with the character of the woman it is attacking.  Don't get me wrong, I think that the "Real women have curves" campaign is horrible - but it's targeting women who have done nothing to deserve to be attacked.

Men - in the sense of the word that invokes "good men", "decent men", "a gentleman" - don't buy girls.
