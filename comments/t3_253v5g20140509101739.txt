I had a bad reaction to one OTC cream I got that was greasy and oil-based. After I put it in it was so painful I couldn't stand it and rushed to the doctor ASAP. That's the first time I got the diflucan which is just one pill, and the first time I took it I had symptom relief within 24 hours, it worked shockingly fast and I didn't notice any side effects. Unfortunately, this time I wasn't so lucky and it doesn't seem to be doing anything :(
