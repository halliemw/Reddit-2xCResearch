Mine's anecdotal too- but I've had it happen too. I was 14, he was 18, and he manipulated me enough with these threats I really thought I was responsible for keeping him alive by keeping him happy. He told me he'd go through with it if I told anyone, or if I didn't text him back within 20 minutes. It's utter hell and I don't wish it on anyone. I wouldn't say all guys do it at all, but my therapist says she's seen a lot of young people have experiences like this too. It's damn effective, unfortunately.
