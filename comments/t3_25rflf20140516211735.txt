Does that mean I should just give up on him in this sense? Because I know I can't "fix" him or anything like that. 

I don't think it's worth breaking up with him over this; I can just either deal with how he makes me feel at times like this or I can just dress as he suggests. It really doesn't matter that much to me; I'm more concerned as to *why* he's even saying these things to me.
