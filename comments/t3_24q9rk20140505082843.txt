yeah, I've had a guy refuse to leave me alone and block me into where I was sitting on a train even after I became outwardly hostile when I told him I wasn't interested. it was the creepiest thing ever, he just ignored my anger and kept making suggestive romantic comments and then got off the train at the same stop as me. When I have told people I am married they tend to take it much better in my experience. Which is horrible. I just want to be left alone :( I've taken to wearing large headphones in public now  and just pointing at them when anyone tried to engage me in conversation( hello introvert) but that still doesnt work a lot of the time and people keep talking..like they dont understand that I CANT HEAR YOU OVER MY ANGRY RIOT GIRL PUNK ROCK! haha.
