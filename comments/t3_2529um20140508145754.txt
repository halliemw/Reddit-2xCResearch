I've done a lot of internet dating and the thing that is clear to me is - you just can't tell till you're in person. This is not a "chubby girl with a pretty face" issue. I'm a skinny girl and plenty of damn people are not attracted to me... and there are plenty of fantastic amazing people who have stimulated my brain and I can honestly call good looking people that I am not actually attracted to. I'm not sure I can be on board with calling this guy's behavior repulsive either... I am thinking about times when I really wanted the physical and mental connections to gel - when my brain felt like the person was a good idea for me, and because sometimes attraction grows organically over time, I made a good-faith effort to attempt a relationship on that level. It generally doesn't seem to be a good idea (in my experience) but it doesn't have to be about pity or anything that poisonous. Consider that that may be projection on your part... that 'repulsive' is probably not at all what was on his mind but more a jumble of 'this isn't quite working for me, but she's so amazing and uh -wtf do I do?' (I think that's been said to me actually and while it wasn't awesome either, I didn't feel judged for it.)
oh - and I've full out been rejected by people who were apparently put off by my personality, but sort of ignored it because they thought I was cute... and that was pretty appalling.
You need to go a little easier on yourself - repellent and repulsive and gross sound like they are judgments coming from you - not from the guy. And while you may not see being friends now - the connection that you had previously seems like it was a genuine thing, and that there is probably a lot to be gained from the friendship. This isn't a failing on either part - this is just people bumbling around awkwardly which is like 90% of relationships. I have a couple really good friends now that began with awkward, embarrassing attempts at dating.
