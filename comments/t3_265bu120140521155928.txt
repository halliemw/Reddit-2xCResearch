Would he be willing to attend therapy with you? That might help. Also, I gave this advice to a friend once, and it worked for her, but we don't know each other and you of course have a better understanding of your relationship. So take from this what you want:

She and her BF had pretty much stopped having sex for a few months and it had gotten really weird, much like the situation you describe.  What I told her was, at some quiet moment when you are both home, just give him a blow job.  The nice thing is that if you're at a point where things are super awkward, with a BJ you don't have to look at him necessarily, you can just pay attention to the task at hand. He'll think it's great, and have that feeling of intimacy again, while you can still be in control somewhat, and maybe not have to open yourself up all in one go like you would if you just initiated full on sex.  Also, after the BJ he'd probably be super into cuddling, which would be nice for building further intimacy and getting comfortable with him again.
