You don't have to start the pill on the first day of your period - you just have to wait 7 days before you're protected if you start it at any other point in your cycle. And spotting isn't a given - I have only ever had spotting on the pill when I've taken it for 9+ weeks in a row without a break (usually I get to around 12 before the spotting starts). Everyone is different though :)
