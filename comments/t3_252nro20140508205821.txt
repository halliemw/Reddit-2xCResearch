>Personally, I think it's fine if she wants to wear makeup every day for whatever reason she wants to. 

Yes? I didn't contradict that.

>To me it seems like you are the one saying not wearing it is better than wearing it to other people, rather than just being concerned about everyone being happy in their own skin.

But... that is literally the definition of not being happy in your own skin, thinking you look sick or bad without using products.


>I could say the opposite to you, regarding "what you would think" if you did wear makeup everyday, but I think that would be a little patronizing.

I used to, actually. Had to for work. Some days it was a confidence booster, some days it was "Fuck, gotta put the slap on, urgh." Now I just go with or without depending on how I feel.
