PMDD is typically controllable with hormonal birth control. You don't even have to have a period at all. I don't know much about the healthcare system in Singapore, but I do know that PMDD is pretty well documented so you shouldn't be laughed out of the office. If you find that you get a really negative response to telling them that you're having suicidal thoughts every month, you could even just ask for birth control. I will warn you that it may take a few tries to find one that works for you, but if you get the monophasic type, you can skip periods entirely. Some women have spotting if they do that so be warned, but there's no medical reason to have a period every month.
