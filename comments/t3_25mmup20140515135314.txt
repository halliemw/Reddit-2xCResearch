Let's not make a blanket statement like that. I was a dispatcher back in college, and my UPD was so much better than the locals that the neighboring towns gave us jurisdiction to investigate, patrol, and arrest. And this was at a campus with a rumored high % of rape.

The issues police departments run up against when investigating rape are compounded when the alleged and victim are in college... there's usually alcohol and drugs involved, no one remembers what really happened (or claims they don't, but still), the victim showers instead of going to the hospital, etc. For my university, at least, they took rape extremely seriously, and that includes bringing roofie rapes to the county prosecutor to determine whether or not to pursue charges, and those are notoriously hard to prove.

Unfortunately, a lot of times the evidence just isn't there to support prosecution, and that's extremely, extremely sad.
