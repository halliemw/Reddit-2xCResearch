I think it's important that neither one by itself *necessarily* leads to murder.  I suffer some real mental illness but I *refuse* to get comfortable with the idea of homicide.  No matter what real abuse I've suffered, I am rationally able to remind myself every day that, yes, Not All Men would abuse me and Not All Men deserve to die.
