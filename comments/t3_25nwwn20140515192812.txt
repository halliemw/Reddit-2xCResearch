My boyfriend broke up with me three weeks ago and I completely lost my appetite. I have lost 4 pounds, and went home to spend some time with my family to just have a change of pace. I don't see much of a difference in my body, but literally every person I interacted with exclaimed over my weight loss. But it hasn't been healthy weight loss (unless surviving on peanut butter and ice cream is healthy now), and it just reminded me of how sad I am.
