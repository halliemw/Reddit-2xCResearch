I think a lot of women use their hair as a security blanket or a way to hide themselves from the world and once it is all gone they cant hide behind it. For some girls it is an expression of their femininity and realize that they now have to be more creative with their makeup and clothing choices (if you are going for really girly type of look as opposed to my norm which was more of a 12 year old boy) as their hair will only do a couple of things now. And for some, maybe it is the shock, especially if they have never been a short haired beauty before.
