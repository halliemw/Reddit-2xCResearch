If they're acting like that there not really your friends. I'd forget about them or just treat them like normal but don't bother trying to apologise or make it up to them or anything. If they wanna be dicks let them crack on. 
As for new friends try meeting some people with the same hobbies or whatever as you? Or maybe get to know your guy friends girlfriends and expand into that friend circle?
Or failing all that just stick with the people that aren't cunts and new friends will come along eventually. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you...but ten I don't tend to worry about much.
