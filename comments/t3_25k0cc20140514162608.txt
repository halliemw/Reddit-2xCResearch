A lot of things!  
  
The weather's been lovely and warm during the day (it's autumn here), and I've spent a little time outside as a result.  
  
I'm successfully growing plants! Normally I just kill them.  
  
I went for a walk yesterday. It wasn't far, and it wasn't fast, but after 6 weeks of being ill to varying degrees, it felt fantastic.
