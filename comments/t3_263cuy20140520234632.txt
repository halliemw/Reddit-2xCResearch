For me the worst part about having a limited number of friends is that you really miss out of just having someone to have long conversations with and talk to about day to day stuff and actually interact with another human being. And that's not usually fixed by going out and doing social stuff like bike riding. I am not really sure if that is the kind of loneliness you are referring to though. Loneliness from lack of communication with friends. Mayeb because they are busy, moved away  etc.
