>CONFRONTING TRIGGERS, NOT AVOIDING THEM, IS THE BEST WAY TO OVERCOME PTSD

Er, yeah, but... in therapy or a safe place at home, not in a friggin lecture hall with 200 other dumb kids in it. I mean, really. I don't see what the big deal is. They aren't censoring the material, just giving people a heads-up so that *if* they have a problem, they can either prepare themselves or avoid having a public breakdown in the middle of class. If you don't have PTSD, then ignore the warnings, whatever, who cares? Are you offended by movies with subtitles, because it would be *better* for people to just learn the language, and you personally don't need them to understand what's going on?
