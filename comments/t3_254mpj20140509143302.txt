I am not in medicine, but nearly everyone in my family is. There's been thousands of times when they've come home and just immediately gone in the shower because they got some sort of fluid on them. I know most of them just feel bad for the patients and they really don't even think about it. If someone is going into medicine everything like that just because technical and not so disgusting. I'm sure the nurse probably just felt bad for you, as for not closing the door I would call and complain. That is actually a violation of your privacy, I'm not sure which state your in but I know in my own that is actually quite illegal. You were on narcotics, you wouldn't have known. Don't even worry about being embarrassed, it definitely seems like you have more on your plate than to worry about something that happens to every woman.
