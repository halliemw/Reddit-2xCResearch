I am so sorry for your loss. My dad passed away when I was an adult (I was 30) and I still feel like I'm missing a part of me. Something in me just disappeared that day and nothing fills this emptiness the same way as his presence. Other members of my family are alive and well. I'm engaged to an amazing man but that emptiness never goes away. Funny thing is we weren't even close but I know he loved me very much. I cannot imagine losing a parent at a young age. I'm so, very sorry. I'm so glad you've found her notebook. I want to do the same for my baby when I'm ready to become a mom.

What you wrote about FB: Please don't feel like you'll bring the mood down. Today is Mother's Day and you love your mom; cherish it. If you want to share something, please do so. You're her daughter and it's your right to remember her any way and any time you'd like. You may even brighten the day for others sharing your pain.
