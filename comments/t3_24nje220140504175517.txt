I mentioned that she should note it to the pediatrician, but if you read through the original post, there's no mention of noticeable body changes or anything like that, and breast buds (beginning of thelarce) typically precede menarche by about two years.  Basically, OP's sister is growing up and her behavior is changing.  If her sister is starting puberty, I experienced basically the same timeline and never had any problems, so I was hoping to reassure OP that this is not completely abnormal and to make sure to keep her anxiety off of her little sister.
