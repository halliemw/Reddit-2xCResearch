he's nothing like that, thankfully. I don't do well with controlling people. They usually piss me off so much I stop being around them. I'm not sure it's healthy for either of us--heroine feels pretty damn amazing when you start out, too....

I swear I'm not going to do anything without dealing with the bf. But we've been slowly breaking up for months now. We know we're done but we still have fun and it's really hard to just walk away.
