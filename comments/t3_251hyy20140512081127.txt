It used to be very conservative, but has been liberalising a lot. Suppport for same-sex marriage is higher than in the USA. In terms of employee and LGBT rights, Ireland is probably more liberal than USA.

However abortion is complex, because some people are really opposed to it, and abortion is available in the UK, so many people can pretend the issue is OK>
