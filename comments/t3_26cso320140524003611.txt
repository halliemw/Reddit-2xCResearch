Except her brother wasn't 6. He was a teenager, old enough to know what sex was and in some places, old enough to consent himself. If they'd both been 6, I wouldn't be too worried about his kids, but he was a teenager. He damn well knew better and wasn't just exploring a new world. He was at an age where he was becoming a sexually aware person, and I think OP should at least be on the lookout for signs of something being wrong in her brother's happy family.
