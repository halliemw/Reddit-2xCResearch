I hear ya. As a somewhat big scary guy myself (6'4", 220lbs), my options for responding to situations like this are limited. If I object to some guy being a jerk there are really two possible outcomes:

(1) If the other guy is much smaller than me I suddenly look like an unstoppable jackass.

(2) If we're the same size then both of us risk serious injury.

Then there's secret option (3) - the guy is a Black Belt in Krav Maga and I end up looking like an unstoppable jackass for getting destroyed by a smaller person, or even worse, getting hospitalized by a big dude with Krav Maga skills.
