I never really imagined it as being something offensive, I guess it all depends on circumstance. 

I know I've read some of those silly cute couple things and whatnot's that suggest that girls actually enjoy this and it is a good way to make someones day better...(Some stories even on Gives Me Hope) I've never used it and never really thought much of it. 

Again I'm sure where, and who is saying it matters, but I think people have in their mind they are trying to basically compliment you or something.
