I worked at McD's for a while. A lot of people say "Would you like a girl or boy toy?" and it sounds familiar if you heard it growing up; it just rolls off the tongue. The official policy (at least since I started working there) was to ask "Would you like Barbie or Hotwheels?" and I totally made an effort to do this, though I admit I fell back on girl/boy if I wasn't sure what toy we had. Not acceptable, just my two cents.

Also, sometimes little boys want the cute doll too, it's not just that the 'girl' toy always sucks.
