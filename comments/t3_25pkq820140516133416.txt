Congratulations! As Penny 33 says, "It's never too late." My own daughter interrupted her college education after two years to get married and raise a couple of kids. After an extended hiatus, she returned to school part time, while working part time and still raising a couple of high-schoolers. She will walk this August to receive her BS â€” at age 41.
