I would suggest someone else (you perhaps) making an initial contact in an abstract way without getting specific about names.
Try and get a feel for the tone of the church, are they reasonable or more hardline.

If the end result of your friend visiting is more brainwashing or a "ganging up" to get her into the fold it would cause more distress.
Best to get a lay of the land first.
