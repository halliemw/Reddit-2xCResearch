> Although increasingly women are touching men sexually in a non-consensual way - grabbing his crotch, grabbing his nipple, and that is not okay!

As a sexual harassment/assault survivor who actually knew some of the attackers? 

Of course girls/women are doing this kind of thing more. They've been taught it's normal. My ex raped me, but she was surrounded by men and women asking her to rape them next. Her first sexual experience was by force, but she thinks that was an acceptable way to help her past her fears of sex... 

The problem is that we're all pretending the boys and girls who pick up these lessons are doing so in a vacuum. Yes, they tend to be more aggressive and lack empathy, but that just means they need an intervention, before they have the chance to create more victims. 

Punishment alone, is too little, too late.
