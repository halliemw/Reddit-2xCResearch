I'm from Belfast and say "good man" a lot. I sometimes say "good lass" to female friends or women who I consider peers or younger. I live in the US and have found that American women enjoy being called lass, so it's kinda flirty. It's certainly not meant to be condescending. 
I don't think you are over reacting. If something bothers you, you have every right to set your boundaries. I suggest "oh, I prefer to be called Michelle. I don't like "girl "". Of course then people will call you Michelle and that's probably not your name ;)
