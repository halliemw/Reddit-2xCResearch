Its solid logs, although I do eat a lot of fiber... oatmeal in the morning, salads/steamed veggies w/lean meat in the afternoon, beans of some sort in the evening and lots of fruit inbetween. Its annoying to poo so much, but then again my tummy is pretty flat because of it! maybe the trade off is worth it~
