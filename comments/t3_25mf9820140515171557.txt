I had mine pierced when I was about eleven, because I wouldn't stop obsessing over the idea after my aunt had her lobes pierced a second time. I thought she was the epitome of cool. By the fifteen, I was only wearing earrings out of habit, by 20 I'd stopped completely. I didn't like the hassle or how they'd always get caught on my hair. The holes gradually shrunk enough that now at 27 I can't get earrings through the holes at all.

The tiny holes are still visible as teeny slits in my lobes if you look closely (though I can't feel them), but hopefully I can still be a member of the unpierced club...? :)
