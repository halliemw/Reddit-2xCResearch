Absolutely - I can't fathom how, as someone with ordinary thought patterns, you'd excuse that behaviour in yourself.

The only experience I have with gross entitlement is professionally. I work as a freelance consultant and also contribute to a help forum (this is all in tech). The help forum has a paid membership, and obviously I charge for services myself.

The number of people who get downright demanding over email that you help them for free can be staggering. I haven't witnessed it too badly, but know people who have. This seems to be a similar mindset, but regarding professional expectations and boundaries rather than personal.
