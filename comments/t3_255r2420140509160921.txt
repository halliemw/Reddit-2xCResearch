This is my first post here (though I've commented a little bit). I've been pretty sad the last few days thinking about things I haven't done yet (namely, get engaged/married and have a baby). 

But today I was thinking about all the things I HAVE done. I moved from Ohio to North Carolina just slightly more than ten years ago knowing only my current boyfriend when I left. He turned out to be a jerk, but I met the love of my life when I was 23. Funnily enough, he's from Michigan. We grew up 2 hours apart and met in North Carolina. 
I basically do whatever I want to do, having no responsibilities aside from bills, 2 dogs, and 2 cats.

I was in middle school when Dawson's Creek premiered, and my biggest dream was to live in Capeside. And I did it. 

Now I'm actually pretty excited to start the next chapter of my life; settling down, marriage, and babies.
