Thank you so much for the insight. Yeah, leaving is really difficult as I'm Armenian, and if you don't know much about the culture, we're a very closely knit community and daughters typically do not leave the nest until they're married. Of course nowadays it's not quite so strict, but serious emphasis is placed on family and togetherness. People in my culture see my dads behavior as perfectly normal and rational, so talking to family in this case is not really any help. My boyfriend however is amazing and is always there for me. If it were not for him I think emotionally, I'd be much worse off at the moment.
