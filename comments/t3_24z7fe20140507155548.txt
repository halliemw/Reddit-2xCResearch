You have some good points, and maybe I'm just overreacting.  This is just one of my favorite subs and I liked it the way it was, I don't want it to change too much.  
edit: The men that were here already were men who wanted to be here, they knew the rules (well, most of them) and played by them.  I have no problem with men on here.  It's just reddit has gotten this disrespectful tone when regarding women and I don't want that to leak here.
