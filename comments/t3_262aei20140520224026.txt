No. The person above me said that abortions are "never" done because the person hadn't gotten around to it-- that there is always a legit, serious reason.

In the case I mentioned, the woman did not believe she was pregnant and refused prenatal care until 5+ months into the pregnancy. By the time she had the pregnancy confirmed, it was too late for her to get the abortion she wanted-- an abortion of a healthy 24-ish week fetus.
