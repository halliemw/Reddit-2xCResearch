I'd be fascinated to know the details of exactly how the requests / firing went down.

If it was "Hi, I'd like my pay increased inline with my predecessor" "No - you're fired", then that's a bit shit.

If it was "Give me more money or I quit" "No, and actually, you're fired", that's a bit less shit.
