> homeopathic bc

For fucks sake. I am sorry, this is the 10th time I have seen this mistake made this this week and it really bothers me, so I'm about to get passive agressive/rude. "Homoeopathic" is not the word you are looking for.

Homoeopathic ≠ Herbal medicine. Homoeopathic ≠ Alternative medicine. Homoeopathic ≠ Holistic medicine. Homoeopathic= tap water and a waste of money.

Boric acid, Apple cider vinegar and Probiotics will help treat BV. A vaginal gel like [acijel](http://www.acijel.com.au/) can offer great releif. These are Alternative, Natural remedies, they are not homoeopathic. These are available OTC. You can ask your chemist if they sell antibiotic creams safe for vaginal use, we don't have these in Australia because we don't tend to use anti-biotics quite as much, but I hear creams like that can be OTC at some pharmacies.

If yoghurt soaked tampons help, but not as much as you'd like, Buy some pro biotic tablets from the chemist (Like Inner Health Plus), and take them vaginally.

What you need though, is anti-biotics. I'm so sorry America is a third world country when it comes to basic health care for its citizens. This will be a daft comment, but being a foreigner I must ask, Isn't this sort of thing what Planned Parenthood normally helps with? affordable sexual healthcare.

OP, make sure you are taking good care of your genitals, as it will help speed up recovery, [this fact sheet](http://mshc.org.au/Portals/_default/uploads/fact_sheets/genital_skin_care_a4.pdf) is my bible. Be aware that BV makes you more susceptible to PID, which can cause infertility.
