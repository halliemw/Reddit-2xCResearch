Have you read any other statements of purposes? There should be some online.

They tend to follow the same template. I've summarized mine as an example in italics.

* Realizing something vaguely in the area of [chosen field] was something that interested you. *My chosen field is Bioenigneering, and I liked figuring out how things worked when I was little, which lead me to study chemical engineering.*

* Steps along the way to grad school. What did you do? What did you learn? What did you find challenginering ["weaknesses"] and how did you overcome them? *I got involved with chemical engineering research that interfaced with biology, and found those questions to be very interesting.*

* How these experiences made you want to go to grad school and chose your field, how you are now motivated to pursue your "legacy" and why the University of X is the perfect place for you. *I want to do research in how forces that cells experience can shape cancer, and my school's program is a particularly great place to do this because of how its partnered with certain other institutions.*

Your thesis is "I have demonstrated my skills and my ability to handle whatever is thrown my way, and my experiences have lead me to really want to do y at University of x"
