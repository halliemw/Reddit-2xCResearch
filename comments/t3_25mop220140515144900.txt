For me you've hit the nail on the head.  In my younger days I fucked up a lot.  Drinking way too much, drug use, letting people down and my job actually led me to feel guilty about the way had to treat people every day.  The job was debt related, so I saw some people in really shitty situations and sometimes they would see no other way out and kill themselves.  I would always view this as my fault as, in my eyes, I didn't do enough to help them (even in situations where there was no way I could help at all).  That guilt would make me want to get wasted to forget and then I would let down people who were close to me, feel guilty about that and want to get wasted all over again to forget.

My life's totally back on track now and I've been seeing a new girl for a few months.  Sometimes things from years ago just pop into my head without warning and make me feel shitty and guilty.  She notices every damn time as I go quiet and try to push whatever it is out of my thoughts.  Then when she sees something's bothering me she asks me about it and I blurt out everything then suddenly I feel okay again, particularly if she assures me it wasn't my fault.

The thing is I would normally never share any of this stuff and only share it with her because I know she's awesome and won't judge me.  I'm what most people would describe as a big, strong guy and sometimes that makes you afraid to show people that you have weaknesses too.  If I were OP I'd take it as a compliment that her boyfriend talks to her about his past.  He probably really doesn't enjoy talking about the things that bother him but he feels close enough to her that he has to tell her.  I know I've carried some things around for years and not told a soul.  It actually amazes me that I finally trust somebody enough to even start to talk about it all.  I think I need to call her now and tell her how great she is.
