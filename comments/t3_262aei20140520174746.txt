Hey there, thank you, it has been mentioned a few times and I do wish I had worded my post better. I know for those women who get late term abortions for  medical reasons, who've been told their baby has some severe health risks, definitely aren't making the decision easily and with a heavy heart I'm sure they follow through wishing it didn't have to be that way.
