I've seen her almost every day since it happened, and each time is for at least an hour, but usually longer. The exceptions to this were the weekend that I was out of state for a family event and two days when I was bedridden with the flu. She has an autoimmune disease, so could not risk being near me. 

As for physical presence, she lives with a grandparent, who she does not want to share this with, and does not feel comfortable straying too far from her normal routine for fear of prodding questions. Text messages are the best I can do. She is warming up to the idea of me staying over one night to see if that provides any help. I have also reiterated my nightly invitation to her to come to my place (it is closer to where she works, so "why?" is an easily answered question), and told her that I would sleep on the couch with her if/when she takes me up on it instead of sleeping in my boyfriend's and my room and leaving her alone.

I'm a little bit confused. Should I take a step back, or try to spend more time with her? I'm doing what I can given her desires and my own life. It was really difficult at first, but I'm finally finding a balance and being honest with her about it. I'm a bit hurt that I'm being accused of "only" providing what is literally constant communication via text, which works for us, but which mrs pink is calling a "cop out".
