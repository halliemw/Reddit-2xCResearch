This was incredibly tough for me to read. Particularly this part,

*"Another close friend of mine, at age 27, was raped and murdered by an intruder in her sleep. She survived in the hospital for several days before passing away, having been beaten so badly. Her hands were broken from fighting back. "*

That was rough to read. 

As a teenage boy I got into my fair share of fist fights, so I know a thing or two about the 'fight or 'flight' mentality that some people have. A woman being put in a 'fight or flight' situation and not even having the legal backing of the society that is supposed to protect her is infuriating. She should be able to pick either or, and still have the confidence that the rest of society will see her decision as the right one.
