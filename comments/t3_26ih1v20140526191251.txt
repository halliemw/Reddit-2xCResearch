The last thing I want to do is exclude someone. I think getting as many opinions on the subject is important. 

However, we also all know that everyone faces expectations. When people chime in with something they face as a white women, it can come off as not really related to the subject as the expectations on different races can be very different. 

Try relating it to the specific subject at hand or just make some sort of disclaimer mentioning that it's not meant to take away from what black women face, or something similar. At least, that's what I can suggest. 

Any other members have suggestions?
