Just say ' Oh by the way, I haven't done this before. Do you still want to have sex?'

Or at least that's me. I mean, if you're going to take that leap with a person then this really should be a little thing if you think about it. It means you trust this person. I honestly don't know why anyone that wanted to be with you would hold it against you though. Don't we all start as virgins?
