My SO and I have not yet done it, but we've been researching and bought some toys and we are planning to give it a try this weekend (both of us). The thought of pleasing him that way really turns me on. He has never tried it and didn't bring it up, but I casually mentioned it and told him I had heard prostate stimulation is amazing for men, and he's interested to try it. I won't say eager, but he's game and I hope he really loves it and it's something we can incorporate frequently!
