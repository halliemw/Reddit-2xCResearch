I think we've all kind of decided SOs are the exception to this rule as if you're dating someone they could be having a monster case if diarrhea and you'd still think they're cute. That's just part of a healthy relationship is finding your partner cute. And your partner will usually think your cute while also respecting why you're angry (ideally). It's different when other people do it.
