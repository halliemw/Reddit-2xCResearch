I think its a fine idea. Obviously you'll want to make sure how to handle the thing properly, but a Taser is definitely a powerful neutralizer - there is a reason why police use it.

That aside, are you thinking of an actual Taser, or just a contact stun gun (which are commonly referred to as Tasers)? Either one has its uses.
