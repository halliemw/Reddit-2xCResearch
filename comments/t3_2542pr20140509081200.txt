Yep, the joys of being on the front pages of one of the most sexist, women-hating  places on the Internet - Reddit.  I'm really angry and hurt about this.  Can't imagine why the mods would betray this community in this way.  I haven't received any PM's yet, but this was so foreseeable.  Way to destroy a great place.

**EDIT:  Just got my first pos-default creepy PM asking for boobies... Thanks mods, that's real inclusive.**

**EDIT2:  Another one!  Yay!**
