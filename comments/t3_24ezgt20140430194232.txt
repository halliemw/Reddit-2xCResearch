Hey y'all, I've been around TwoX for a while, but I'm using a throwaway because I don't want this linked to my main account.

 You might know that a Brown student recently held a press conference regarding the fact that another student who the university found responsible for strangling and raping her was [invited back to campus after only a one-year suspension](http://feministcampus.org/brown-university-a-safe-haven-for-rapists/) [trigger warning for sexual assault]. 

In response, Brown students have written 16 specific demands of the university for overhauling its sexual assault policy and education program. It's really important to put public pressure on this administration, which hasn't always been very receptive to students' suggestions.
