> To stay in an abusive relationship and choose an abuser in the first place you must have had what I call a broken good people radar. (which boils down to lack of self esteem and self -love).

That's an incredibly dangerous thing to throw out.  It's a common victim blaming statement.  Abuse doesn't just show up one day.  It starts out with a lot of charm and steadily increasing manipulation that *anyone* can fall for.  That manipulation tears down the victim's self-esteem regardless of where it was at the beginning.
