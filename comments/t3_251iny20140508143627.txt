It's not clear if he was on Snapchat solely for the flirtatious attention, but as it says in the original post, the top three snapchat connections he had formed were attractive women he does not know, so it was definitely a big component of his use of the app. The OP clarified also that it wasn't the flirtation that was the problem (as it seems to be tacitly tolerated in the relationship as long as she and her partner are open about it) but the lying and hiding of it. Judging by her boyfriend's reaction at getting caught at it, he knew this as well. Also OP stated in the original post that HE KNEW THIS WOULD BE A PROBLEM FOR HER. It's not about what you think constitutes destructive behavior in a relationship or how many warlizards you like to send selfies to, this relationship had established the fact that this would be destructive behavior, and he violated that. This is all information available to you right at the top of this thread-- in the original post.
