>The first three months or so are boring in terms of who every babe is, food, sleeping and pooping are really their only interests. They really really are interested in those things. As they get older than that, they definitely visibly have preferences and are starting to process life. Although I'm also going to say by 30 weeks I knew how my kids like spicy foods.

So aren't you basically saying you can go the other way at least for a few months before the baby begins to show signs of what ever factors you consider that would caused them to be considered a person with full rights?
