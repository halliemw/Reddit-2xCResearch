> I would be lighting the torches and sharpening my pitchfork if you were out there harassing scared pregnant women, but for changing your stance on abortion even if that takes it farther from my own? Not at all. 

Thank you, I would also be sharpening my pitchfork under those circumstances! Which is why I tried my hardest to word my post as best as I could to show I am still pro choice, and support legal and safe options for women, I just feel more anti-abortion than I used too, as I never was anti before. It's confusing in my head, but I figured that is why this sub is here, to voice/share those feelings.
