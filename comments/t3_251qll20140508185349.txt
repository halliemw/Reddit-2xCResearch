Honestly I couldn't tell you at this moment. I'm in the process of moving out of my apartment and have just been exhausted all day and memory is escaping me.  I know I got absolutely BLASTED one time for suggesting that we don't publish the names of suspected rapists until after the indictment because of the stigma of the crime. Got called a misogynist that didn't care about victims and so on. There's other little things that I don't quite fit perfectly line with and I'll get some nasty comments or PMs.

Truly, I love this sub. But pretending that it's a super friendly, open minded forum is just silly. I didn't sub here for feminist views and it irritates me when people say "well it's a woman sub you should expect it". I'm a woman. Does that mean I don't get a safe place to talk just because I don't identify as feminist?

And yes, I have heard the "feminism isn't what you think it is you're probably wrong" but honestly I have been on here for three years. Long enough to see what this community defines as feminism and I can still tell you I don't always agree 100%. And that 2% I don't agree with, the community turns vicious.
