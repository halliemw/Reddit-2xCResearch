You make it sound so easy, but realistically, you can't just get over things like that. 

And it's certainly not ok to hurt others in your own pursuit of happiness. Sometimes it is necessary for both people to be in a better place, but if you want to be with someone else, you should break it off with the other person. Cheating is not ok.

My dad cheated on my mom. Yes they're adults, maybe they are at an age where it seems they should be able to figure it out by themselves, but that isn't always the case. Parents are only people, and even they need the advice, support and help of others.
