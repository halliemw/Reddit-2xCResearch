I agree. I completed my PhD last year, doing a one year postdoc now, and though I'm super proud of the achievement, I would not to it again. My PhD advisor destroyed my love of science and research. I stuck around in academia for a year so I had a job while my fiance finished his PhD. I have been working with a great mentor (complete 180 from my PhD work) but NOTHING could make me contemplate sticking around in academia. I'm sick of the living month to month and hoping nothing goes wrong that I need money for, and getting sick from constant stress.

Academic and industry jobs today want PhDs with extensive postdoctoral experience. You're looking at an additional 3-6 years following your PhD in the sciences. I've decided to step away from research, and it's the biggest relief, in all honesty. If I never step foot in a lab again, it will be too soon. But I'll be honest- it's a struggle to find a job outside of academia. Right now, we're waiting for my fiance to find a postdoc, and I'll figure out what I'm doing from there. I've taken up freelance editing on the side, which is helping to make a decent chunk of change. Who knows- maybe I'll be able to afford the repairs my car needs soon. 

OP, seriously consider whether staying in your PhD is worth it. It can be an incredibly rewarding experience, and though my experience was mostly negative, there were positives. I met my fiance. Made some of the best friends I have. There was nothing better than the moment I skyped my mom in for my thesis defense and called her to tell her I had passed my defense. But a PhD is not a promise of a good job the way many people think it is.
