This is incredibly simplistic and demeaning. 

Of course surrounding yourself with people you aspire to be is a good idea and I'm sure many people try and do this. But what does that have to do with sexism when it happens on public transport, at work, walking down a street, in classrooms, at the library, out in a bar or a club? You can't ask all the people you don't aspire to be to leave those places. I take it you don't announce in those places "I know some of you might be considering behaving in a way that's sexist but I don't have time for that right now".

As for sexual assault, in many cases it's people that you thought you trusted that aren't all they seemed. There are people who say whatever you want to hear to get close to you or just turn out to be the opposite of what they said they were.
