Dude... the university is a private institution. It gets to set rules. **No one is legally entitled to a Brown education.** If you're found to have violated the code of conduct--for which there is a formalized process, and for which the standard is a "preponderance of evidence," then you're subject to punishments. 

If you steal from your workplace, your boss doesn't have to go through the criminal justice system in order to fire you. Cheating on tests is not against criminal law, but a university can still punish you for it. 

Sure, maybe the university invites lawsuits for expelling someone, but that's true of all expulsions, and I'd rather the school put its students' safety before its fear of a lawsuit. 

I really suggest that you read up on the differences between the criminal justice system and a university's own disciplinary system, because they are very different--different processes, standards of evidence, and punishments, and there are lots of reasons why a survivor of sexual assault would choose to use only one and not the other.

Also--I think you mean "pseudolegal," which I suppose is sort of what the disciplinary system is, but for good reason--you don't want your university disciplinary system to be the same thing as the criminal justice system.
