Saskatchewan--we're about 20-30 years behind the rest of Canada (but there's like no air pollution--moved here from Ontario--and the sunlight is year-round awesome). 

*I* think there's evidence. Rape trials in Canada have resulted in convictions on less evidence than what I have just sitting useless in a duffel bag in my closet: 

* clothing/panties from that day the police told me to leave at home when they ordered me to the station for an interrogation against my will. 
* witnesses they haven't gotten statements from--after asking me for their contact info and telling me they would interview them.
* photographs of the blood/bruising--police said they didn't want them.
* the full story that I haven't been able to provide to the police in my own words. They wouldn't acknowledge the differences that my being Autistic would affect--made assumptions about what I'd just "know" when, as someone with has Autism, I can't pick up on social signals and non-verbal communication or get people's intentions or recognize danger...my brain's not wired to do those things but the police just assumed I'd 'get' what a neurotypical woman would.
* there's my word, I mean, my credibility's excellent (PM me for details) and it's a well-established fact that people with Autism very rarely lie (as in, just make stuff up for no reason--it's unheard of), but unfortunately the employer of the rapist (and also myself until I was fired for not signing a gag-order contract to not speak about being raped in the workplace by a coworker) slandered me to the police before I'd made a report and discredited me. 
After that, nothing I said to the police they took seriously, failing to verify anything I said while they very easily could have done so. The guy's credibility isn't great--the guy's been caught lying to his wife about him cheating and to our employer about what he was wanting to start with me and I've got screenshots, letters, emails, and video to prove that. 
* hours of therapy records from a sexual assault center counselor, a psychologist who specializes in adults with Autism, and a psychologist at the student health center. 
* medical reports from 2 separate independent physicians/gynecologists stating that the damage done to my reproductive system was caused by a sexual assault and that the ongoing problems (such as I can't use certain feminine hygiene products, can't have sex--and by extension, can't have kids ever either) stem directly from being raped. 
The report states that there's nothing in my life history or previous-to-the-rape sexual experiences that would cause this, I wasn't raped before and was never abused by anyone ever, not sexual, physical, or emotional. 

It was never "he said, she said" it was: "His employer--who is also the big boss for the police department--spoke to the police about her statement that she'd been raped after the employer had told her she was lying because, 'Married men don't rape.' She was unwilling to speak to police after the employer had met with them in private. The assailant was never spoken to, but his lawyer was--at least seven times."  

The police told me that even though I said, "No, I don't want to have sex with you," and repeatedly pulled my pants back up, that I still consented to sex because the circumstances were such (I was in a room alone with a man) that the circumstances implied that I was saying yes even though I'd verbally said "No." The police have ignored my pointing this out to them [this recent case](http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/7942/index.do) which says:

"[47] The jurisprudence of this Court also establishes that there is no substitute for the complainant’s actual consent to the sexual activity at the time it occurred. It is not open to the defendant to argue that the complainant’s consent was implied by the circumstances, or by the relationship between the accused and the complainant.  There is no defence of implied consent to sexual assault: *Ewanchuk*, at para. 31." *R. v J.A.* (2011) SCC 28 

I never even got to argue with the defence about implied consent--the police were defending the rapist's actions and telling me I'd agreed to have sex with him from the very start. The transcript of their interrogation of me is pretty damn interesting to read but it's long--about 17,000 words--and rather intense given the subject matter. 

There are some incredible lines from the police's sex crime investigator, who said things to me like, "women lie about rape all the time to try and get away with things, like to get out of writing exams. You're no different from them, so just admit that this wasn't a sexual assault." I was too stunned by the sexist rape myths she was relying on to rebut her very much but I definitely did try. 

Nevertheless, if you were curious about the whole thing and wanted to try reading it, just send me a PM.
