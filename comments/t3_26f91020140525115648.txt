Hey, I don't mean to disrespect what you want, but thought that maybe a different perspective could be helpful. 

I think the whole idea of being okay with being single, still puts most of the emphasis of your happiness on relationship status. Which feels more like a salve than a fix.

When I was single, I desperately wanted to make myself feel okay with it. But the truth for me was, focusing on being single made me feel worse, like I was masking my feelings. So I stopped thinking about relationships and focused on me. I decided to turn myself into the person I would want to date.

As a part of that, I set goals for myself. I went to the gym, I went back to school, I hung out with friends more. None of this was to make me feel better about being single, but to make me feel better about being me. It took some time, and in that time, I went from chronically single to a serial monogamist. I went into relationships with no expectations, because I was still working on myself and the success of that relationship had no bearing on my life. On the downside, I tended to ignore early red flags and let relationships continue further than they should have, but every relationship was a learning experience.

Now, I'm dating someone I love more than anyone I've ever been with. It's an exciting feeling that I have never felt before. But getting here took years. Sometimes it sucked, but it was worth the journey. I went from looking in the mirror and thinking "Who would want to date me?" to thinking "Good god who WOULDN'T want to date this?!"

Anyway, this is all anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt. Just wanted to let you know there might be a different way of looking at your situation. I hope you have a happy life :)
