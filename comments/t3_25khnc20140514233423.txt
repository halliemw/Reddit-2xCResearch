I just got hired for a web development position at a company (I start in June!) and I'm actually a little bit hesitant because I'm coming from a background that's more communications and media based. I know the basics of coding but I'm nervous that I won't know enough. It doesn't come naturally to me. The company seemed excited to have me be a part of their team though, which is a reassuring feeling. My cousin's wife is part of the programming team, which is cool, but as far as I know, she and I will be the only females on the tech side of things. Do you happen to have any advice? What exactly about that sort of work do you feel is good for women?
