Just a few things that I'd try for my partner.

Buy or make a nice card and write something romantic in it. Make some coupons for naughty/nice acts (get out of washing up free card, for example). Prepare a meal of his favourite foods, including dessert. (For bonus points, you could do it in a sexy outfit). Eat it by candlelight. Go out to see a movie (or download one) that he'll like. Give him a massage or foot rub (again, bonus points for doing it in a sexy outfit). Come up with a new position to try.
