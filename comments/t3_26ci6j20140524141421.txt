Ugh :( 

Honestly the most annoying thing about concrete dust is getting it in your hair. It made my hair SO GROSS AND DRY (hence why I'm wearing the headband).

Don't worry too much. The guys doing the work are stupid for not wearing masks because it's long term exposure that's bad for you. It can cause silicosis of the lungs.
