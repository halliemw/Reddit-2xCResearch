I do need it, just not for long. Still, he is not paying it anyway, so I'm making due without it. I'm the first girl he ever had a baby with, but he has a son he is doing the same thing to with another woman.  With both of us, he told us to keep the baby because he wanted it (shit, I wanted it too) and then ducked out afterwards because he changed his mind. I don't want to punish him. I clearly said that. I don't care enough about him to hate him. I could have him arrested right now, but I don't. Right now I'm on food stamps and I was required to file for child support so I could continue to get them because right now,I AM poor, and as much as my boyfriend is a loving man who wants to marry me and adopt my daughter, that's not where we are at right now, and assuming it should be his responsibility to make up the difference for  a kid he didn't make so my ex husband can continue to flit around town making babies he can't support and taking off, sounds really stupid. 

He doesn't want our child? His problem. He can't afford to support her? His problem. He doesn't want to pay child support even though we decided together to keep and raise this child? His problem. 

But you know what? I love my daughter. I love her too much to force her dad to stay in her life just to "punish" him. She deserves better than to have such a malicious force in her life. So I'll let him go. I'll close the child-support case, as soon as the government allows me. I'll let my boyfriend adopt her in the right time, but for you to suggest that he DESERVES ANY of these courtesies I just described, is LUDICROUS. 

EDIT: Also, I said that my boyfriend and I split the bills and have separate accounts, so no part of that suggests my boyfriend supports my daughter an I. All I suggested, was that, since I am very poor, were an emergency to arise where I NEEDED money I didn't have, my boyfriend would help me.
