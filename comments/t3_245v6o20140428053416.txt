Well I've certainly experienced both sides of the coin. Either they hit on you, or I get the "you must be fat/ugly/unattractive" etc.. I tried to talk on mic when I first started playing RPG's... I've since stopped because I don't like the harassment. I get the occasional message, but just ignore them. It's unfortunate that I had to do that, because not all players are like that, and it makes more sense to talk on mic to play the game as a team, but I'd rather just not deal with it at all. In that situation, I've found a few good guys who I generally make a party with, and go from there. Certainly I don't mean to generalize about all players, but a few bad experiences of harassment can ruin the game playing experience.
