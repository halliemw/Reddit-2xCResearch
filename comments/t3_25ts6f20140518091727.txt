In the future,  when you find yourself in this situation again,  well any situation where the toilet will not flush,  do this.  Fill the largest thing you can fill  with water and dump it into the toilet.  [It will flush the toilet at the system is designed to have water input,  it doesn't matter where the water comes from only that there is water.](http://www.howstuffworks.com/toilet1.htm)  A bucket or trash can will force the contents of the bowl through the trap into the sewer.
