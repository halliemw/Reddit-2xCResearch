This is much more along the lines of what I was aiming at having clarified, you seemed to have put it much better than I could. The obvious vibe from the front page with those kinds of comments was and is what was causing me so much confusion. Regardless of the FAQ had I seen it. I would have likely proposed the same question as I feel there could be many in my position that are confused or discouraged by the level of disconcerting comments like you pointed out.
