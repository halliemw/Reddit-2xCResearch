I agree. It gets roughly the same gas mileage as my last car (a 2007 Focus hatchback) and is only slightly bigger, so I'm happy with how it turned out overall. I think if there was one thing I'd do differently it'd be having bucket seats in the back with a little bit of an aisle for more cargo room, but the rear bench seat as a whole can move forward and backward, which helps a lot with the storage (and passenger leg room!) situation.
