Very true, and I have eaten (gasp!) a cold turkey sandwich and nothing happened, but there are some things, such as the massage that I was refused. And once you start showing I've seen people be refused things like sprouts on a sandwich. I'm more upset I guess that there just seems to be no end to the judging double standards that do nothing but hurt :-(
