I think these threads are fair warning about content on TwoX.  Although we don't usually have 10/10 top stories being about our bodily functions & secretions, topics of this sort are frequent.  Incidental default subscribers to TwoX might want to unsubscribe if they don't want to see these posts.  (Just like many people probably want to unsubscribe from r/atheism). 

And as a woman who has to deal with some of these issues, I always find it hilarious to discuss them ~anonymously online. :)
