I read somewhere on reddit yesterday that appealing to logic is not a very effective persuasive approach. He needs to appeal to his friend's pathos. 

How does it make him feel to see his wife suffer, to see his work suffer? Does he regret choosing the church over the people who love him? Is he afraid of losing her?

It could be a bit harsh but it will be more impactful than using the Bible as a rational authority since the Bible contradicts itself a lot.
