I can see that I'm replying to a post nine days late, but I feel that it is important to say that I deeply appreciate all of the work you mods have been doing.   
Making changes is difficult. Obviously, not everyone is going to be happy. I suspect that the unhappy people make more noise than the people who are content.   
Nonetheless, I want it said that many of us (if not almost all of us) have complete faith that all of you are working hard and trying hard to do what is best for this subreddit.  
I recognise that it is going to take some time to know how this default status is working out. You will need time to see what issues arise, try methods to solve the problems and then allow some time to go by in order to re-evaluate the situation.  
I'm patient and I believe most of us are patient because we trust you.
