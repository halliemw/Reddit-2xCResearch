I went to a genetic counseling seminar, and one of the women there was a patient who had had a double mastectomy because she had one of the BRCA mutations and what her oncologist called a stage 0 tumor. She had debated getting the mastectomy done for a while because hadn't had kids yet, but she decided that it was more important for her to be there to raise her children than to spend a single year breastfeeding.

She also said that hearing breastfeeding horror stories from friends and family members after she had the procedure done just verified that she had made the right choice.
