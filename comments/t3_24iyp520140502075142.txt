I don't know, that may be the OP's interpretation of it - I didn't read anything that said it was her body specifically that was the problem. I was wondering if other dresses or clothes that were roughly the same in coverage/fittedness were picked up on too, or if it was just this one dress.

To me, that would change the situation a lot: if it was THAT dress vs dressing in a certain style vs skin coverage.
