I would say something to her along the lines of "I noticed that you were very uncomfortable in the park the other day. Can you tell me why?" That can help open a dialogue, so that if something is going on, she can tell you about it, and if it's just the normal growing up stuff that, sadly, most girls go through, it can open a pathway for you to talk about consent and how she has value that isn't dependent on her body.
