It actually protects against 4 strains, 2 which cause 70% of cervical cancer cases, and another 2 which protects against over 90% of genital warts (some researchers surmise it's actually closer to 99% due to more-recent sampling data of HPV strains involved in causing genital warts). I was not sexually active prior to receiving Gardasil. I read the notes on my case report and my GYN wasn't 100% sure, but simply stated that it "may or may not be" HPV.
