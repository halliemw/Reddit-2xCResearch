Disclaimer: I'm a gay dude.

He might not like to engage in PDA and that's totally fine(in my opinion), but if it's bothering you then you should bring it up with him in a respectable, mature manner. No PDA does not mean that he isn't interested in you, relationships are all different. 

Being comfortable with kissing will come in time. Try not to let your lack of experience worry you too much, no one is good the first time. Also, you should ask what he needs before assuming what he needs. No guy(or girl) is truly typical and everyone's needs in a relationship differ.

As an aside, saying "hey come here and help me win a bet." probably wasn't the best thing you could say, and may have turned him off.
