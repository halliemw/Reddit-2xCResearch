I think it really depends. My mother is like an older sister to me, and she's the best friend I have. But my father and I don't have that. Like you, I am often fearful of saying the wrong thing and starting an argument (or the silent treatment, which I think I prefer). Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. I've tried to improve things by becoming interested in what he likes, but that only goes so far.

I also have friends who are very distant to their parents or very close like me and my mother.

So I would really say that what you're experiencing is about average. I hope you are able to find some common ground with your mom. Best of luck!
