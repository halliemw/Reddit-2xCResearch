This is one of the best replies in this thread. I really appreciate your thoughtful input. 

Obviously some people are saying "well just lose weight". Well, motherfuckers, if things had been going the way I had intended, that would have already happened. In fact, I never would have been fat in the first place. 

You're so right about people treating being fat as a character flaw, or whatever. No matter the reason it happened. I dare say if everyone had to wear their "character flaws" on the outside they'd be a lot less quick to judge.
