I think a lot of this advice is great. Here is a more detailed description of (my experience of) the pain people keep talking about. My first time the entrance of my vagina felt like it was being pulled taut. I think you can best simulate it by grabbing your top and bottom lips (on your face) near one corner of your mouth and pulling them them gradually further apart until you start to feel a little pain. You'll feel tension in the corner of your mouth and it will linger for just a little while. That's about what I felt down there, but around the entire edge. I continued to feel sore for a short while and I didn't feel ready for sex again for a day or two after. I imagine this may vary dependent on penis size but I don't know.

I also played with his flaccid penis afterwards because I'd never seen one before. They're strange and cool. My SO was fine with it when I asked. I still think they're really strange and interesting five years later. You might only get the chance after sex because a lot of guys will get at least semi-hard when their penises are handled. If they are completely flaccid they can bend in any direction and lay flat against his stomach. It's amazing. Sometimes my SO's is too tender after sex so I'll stop handling it and just rest my hand on it while we cuddle. He likes that.
