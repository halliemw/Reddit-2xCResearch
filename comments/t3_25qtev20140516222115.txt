It's too early for a test. The earliest will be right before my vacation. I'm so excited for this vacation the thought of canceling it kills me, but I also make enough to maybe just go and let go and have a great time but be broke and use my income to terminate when I get back if I decide... My missed perioud won't happen until the day I get back, he claims to be infertile, part of me wants to not worry, go on my girls trip and deal with all of this when I get back
