No. In my country, there is only maternal leave. No paternity leave. It isn't even a concept. Men are expected to have nothing to do with babies for the most part. The leaves they get aren't given to them by law but by the companies (private ones mostly) because people give family a LOT of importance here. So if you have to take your wife or mom to the doctor every day, they will work something out for you. Since this isn't legally required though, a company or your manager can abuse it. 

For example, we get 12 weeks maternity leave (http://womeninpublicservice.wilsoncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Maternity-leave-chart-final.png). I worked at a company that was based in USA but had an office in my country. They had our HR policies written to match those of the US and tried to deny us paid maternity leave. The owner is a terrible person who exploits employees like this and no law can be used against him.
