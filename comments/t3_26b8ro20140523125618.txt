It's good for women. Because the reason we're getting so many trolls and mansplainers is because they've been able to ignore us and explain away their attitude as "there are no girls on the internet". Now they have to see us. To look at us, to know our issues exist. We're much harder to ignore now. 

It's also good in that a lot of women who didn't know this place existed now do. They can come here and see that they are not alone, and if they want safer spaces, we have many of those available in varying degrees of strictness.
