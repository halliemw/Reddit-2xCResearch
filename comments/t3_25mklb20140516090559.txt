Almost all of the old GM CEO's "extra" pay was in stock appreciation. The previous GM CEO was in a turnaround the company or die scenario, because GM was bankrupt. A turnaround is far more risky and difficult than running the current GM. If he had failed, he would have left the company with a tiny fraction of what he actually made because all of his equity compensation would be worthless. If the current GM CEO does well and the stock price goes up significantly, then her compensation package would suddenly look far more attractive than it was when she took the job.

Most of this stuff is simply willful misinterpretation to create a story. High level employees such as executives are typically compensated in a manner that is tied to performance metrics, typically through stock options so their total compensation is tied to the stock price. It doesn't get much fairer than that. The market judges your performance and pay.
