I feel so unknowledgeable and embarrassed about how much I don’t know. Thank you for your lack of judgement and informative reply.

I wasn’t very wet at all this time around and he constantly stopped and remarked that I was being very stiff/unrelaxed and we could stop, but I kept insisting I was into it. I think my body was signalling the opposite. It was pretty annoying. I think more foreplay would have helped now that I think about it, mainly as there *wasn’t any* lol.  We hadn’t had sex since before Christmas and he was ready to go in like less than a minute. The first time around, there was a lot more build up.  I think I knew I needed more ‘warming up’ but just felt too awkward to say anything. I still do. We’re seeing each other again in a week or so after I’m done with my assignments and I’m just worried I’ll be the same stiff again! I don’t know how to ask for more of a warm up either ughhh I can’t believe I’m an adult with a job and a degree and I’m hiding like a child about this.
