I lost my mom when I was 15 and I can understand how awesome this must be for you. I would say about 80-90% of our possessions were thrown away because I only went to the house to collect things two or three times and I still haven't gone through the photos and such. Comforting to know there are others who understand the whirlwind of losing a single parent at a young age.
