Try phoning smaller local restaurants to her- they may be willing to make a lot of substitutions/additions and deliver it. Food is so major but sleep is hard to get that first week, so zombies in the kitchen is awesome to avoid. That's the biggest thing I needed/wanted- houseguests the first two weeks actually exacerbated the baby blues and I had with my first and I didn't handle it well. It wasn't nearly as bad with my second, but I still didn't want people that weren't immediate family in my home.
