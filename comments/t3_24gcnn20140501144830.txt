She does a brilliant job of showing what life's like as a woman and how we impact the world around us (and of course how the world impacts us). I first read The Summer Before the Dark and it had a huge impact on me in terms of realizing how much we value youth and beauty in society and how that can hold you back as you age. What Lessing brings to the table that the YA books lack is a view of a middle aged woman finding her way.
