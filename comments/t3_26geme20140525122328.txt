I totally get that. I do. I know his intentions were good. It's just that sometimes it's not that easy. Not impossible, perhaps. But if it were so easy to just "be healthier", I would have done it from the beginning. The worst part is that I have been dieting. I have been exercising. I have made a little progress. Just a reminder that oh hey, it's obvious to everyone that you're still fat. Just a bummer. It's not something that will spur me to make a change, I've already started to do that. Just a reminder that my failure to be what I should is as glaringly obvious as I was afraid it was.
