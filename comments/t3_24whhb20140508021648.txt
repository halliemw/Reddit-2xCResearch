Generally people who are looking to adopt a newborn infant are not the same people who are looking to adopt an older child from foster care. 

Almost all newborn infant adoptions are done through **private agencies** and these newborns don't spend any time in the foster care system. Foster care adoptions are done through public agencies. **It's not like you would go to an adoption agency and they tell you, "We're out of newborns, so here's an older kid".**  You make the decision about what kind of child you are able/willing to parent before you start the process of adoption. 

Foster children are mostly kids who were taken from their parents by Child Protective Services because the parents were abusive or neglectful, not children who were voluntarily placed for adoption. Foster kids often have very significant psychological trauma from the abuse/neglect and have special needs as a result. Some people who are looking to adopt sincerely feel they are not equipped to deal with the special needs of a child who experienced severe sexual abuse or was so badly neglected that the child never learned how to attach to other people properly (look up Reactive Attachment Disorder). These type of people often want to adopt a newborn instead. I personally think that it is completely valid to be honest that you cannot handle a child with special needs from the foster care system, and there's no reason people like that can't do a perfectly fine job raising a newborn.
