In this particular case, the OP hadn't actually negotiated a time when the parent would be back. Supposing the babysitter had actually specified the absolute limit of when they would have to leave, but the parent was still not back by then, would your position be the same?

My thought process went along the lines of: the parent arranged for ~2 hours of supervision for their toddler > the parent took 12 hours to return > for all the parent knew, their toddler had been left alone for up to 10 hours.
