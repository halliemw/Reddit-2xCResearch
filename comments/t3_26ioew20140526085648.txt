Don't define your life by the men that are in it. I know most girls at 16 are obsessed with boys and romance, but my advice would be to not force it. Have fun, experiment and be safe, but don't focus your entirety on finding love. Don't work hard at impressing boys or be upset if you don't feel as pretty as other girls; when you find the right man, he will love you for exactly who you are and how you look. Nice guys *do* exist and they're very much worth the wait. (This advice applies for both sexes and any sexual orientation.)

Also, have as much fun as you can now. Be safe, obviously, but do all of the things you want as much as you can *right now*. Once you graduate and have to enter college/the real world, you'll hardly ever have time for the hobbies and passions you used to love.

Don't get so wrapped up in the present and let high school drama get to you. In 10 years, you'll probably barely remember the names of most of the people you're surrounded by now. Remember that you have an entire life to enjoy after you go through the hell that is high school. Focus on the future and what you want to do with it.

K, hope that advice from a 30 year old helps. :)
