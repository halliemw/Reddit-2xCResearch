I'm with you on "miss" making me feel infantlized. Miss, as it was taught to me, is for people who "need someone older and wiser telling them what to do" ala Sound of Music. Ma'am is for people who are mature enough to handle their own affairs. Children are called "miss", teenagers are mixed depending on how they're acting, and adults are "ma'am" unless they're acting like children, in which case you give no title, because no respect is due.
