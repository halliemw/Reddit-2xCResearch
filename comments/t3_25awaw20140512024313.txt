Well unless they are willing to charge him (and they need sufficient evidence to be sure of a conviction for that) they can't force him into the station for questioning, he has to volunteer. The upside to him not co-operating is it implies guilt, the downside is they can't question him to see if he will incriminate himself.

The thing is, in the eyes of the Law an accusation (of any crime) is still just an accusation, they can't operate under the premise of assumed guilt because that is not how the legal system works.
