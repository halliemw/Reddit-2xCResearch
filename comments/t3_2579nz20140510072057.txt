Talk to your parents. IMMEDIATELY. all bad things start like this. The sociopaths like them test you to see how long you'll try to handle it by yourself. The longer you think you can handle these manipulators by yourself, the longer they have to change tactics to keep you in conversation. Speak to a parent or guardian immediately and don't take any advice you get on the internet.
