Out of curiousity (since I have a son, I'd like to know what kinds of things fall through the gaps) which came as a surprise?

No judgement, just wondering. (You can PM me if you'd feel more comfortable.)

Edit- I've gotten a few PMs now, and I've asked the guys who did so if I could share their experiences sans usernames, because I find it really interesting what they are sharing. So I will be updating (with their permission) responses.

>I thought the hymen was something like piercing an ear, that I would have to somehow jam my penis through skin, so I never had sex with virgins because I knew I couldn't do that no matter how hard I was.
