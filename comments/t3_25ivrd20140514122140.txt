It sounds like, while short, their relationship was very intense, and I don't really like the attitude of deciding when someone else needs to be over their relationship. He was in love, he was hurt, he hasn't been able to process feelings from his relationship--I don't think this means there is anything seriously wrong with him. And I do think that the complete cut-off adds a second pain to the first pain of not being together anymore, making it harder to resolve either.
