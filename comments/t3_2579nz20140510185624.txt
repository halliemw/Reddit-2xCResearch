If I were you, I would get in touch with a guidance counselor at the very least. Maybe even the cops if you think he'll resort to violence or self-harm. Contacting the parents might help, but you should definitely have a third party who at least knows what's going on. In the meantime, don't engage at all. Don't even respond to him. So sorry this dude keeps harassing you, OP.
