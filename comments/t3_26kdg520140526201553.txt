Could be worth making the case to get an allowance. It's good for far more things than underwear shopping. Show them the pros: you learn money management, you learn how to shop for your own clothing and stick within a budget, you learn how to use a bank account, etc. Often, bank accounts can be linked with your parents - mine were, so my parents could keep track of my spending. Make an estimate of how much they spend on you now for clothes and entertainment &suggest a reasonable allowance based on this number. Perhaps offer to do certain chores? Cleaning the pool?

You can measure your self for bras - check out /r/abrathatfits. You'll need either a sewing tape measurer or something flexible like a ribbon + a ruler. Either way, no boob grabbing necessary. It's the circumference around your rib cage and the circumference around your breasts that are they measurements used for bra sizing.
