I moved to metro Detroit from Texas before my senior year in high school. What I was surprised at was the fact that my friends I made told me they didn't receive sex ed during school! Im from Texas for crying outloud and learned about it there. I personally don't think the reason for this is solely based on poverty (the area I moved to is a bice mixture of middle and lower upper) but the lack of sexual education.
