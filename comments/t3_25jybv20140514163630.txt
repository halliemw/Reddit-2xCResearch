Think of it this way. You leave a window unlocked in your house while you are out running errands. You come home and an animal has used the unlocked window to break in, and has taken up residence inside your home. The government tells you that you must take care of this animal for 9 months, and you cannot free it into the wild because it would surely die. At the end of 9 months, you then have the choice to take it to an overcrowded shelter, or keep it for the rest of its life. You don't have savings tucked away to care for this animal - a very expensive animal to take care of - and you've heard the government has ways to help you out, but you are largely on your own to take care of the animal.

Now you may argue that the rules should be different because a fetus is a human being. But many, many people do everything they can to prevent this fetus from coming about, yet accidents still happen. And because an accident happens, should this person be forced into the above situation? Don't you think that's taking away some rights of the person who tried the hardest they can, given our current contraceptive technology, to prevent the accident? Unless you subscribe to the idea of abstinence, but why should everyone subscribe to the same sexual philosophy?

We describe this country as the "land of the free," but there are many people trying to tell us how to behave in the bedroom and then punish people when they don't act accordingly and an accident happens as a result. These are responsible people trying their hardest to be safe in the bedroom and live as they'd like to live. I don't think an accident should take away a person's rights, at least until the fetus could survive outside the womb. At that point the parent has had many weeks to mull it over and decide they do in fact want the child. If you're that person staring anxiously at the pregnancy test in the bathroom, do you want a choice if a + result appears?
