I think that is a great idea. I am glad that you got him talking. Now you need to find a psychiatrist, call them, explain the situation, make an appointment, and get him there. Once you do that, hopefully they will get him back on meds, and you can get your spouse back. I am so sorry for what you are going through. Know that you are not alone.
