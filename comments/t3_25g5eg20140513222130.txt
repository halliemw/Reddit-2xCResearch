I've had it for six months, and I love it. I've had none of the problems you describe. But seriously, if it's not working for you after a year, get something else! I had the mirena iud for two long miserable years, because doctors kept telling me that the debilitating cramps I was having couldn't be from the iud. They were wrong, and I should have gotten it out sooner.
