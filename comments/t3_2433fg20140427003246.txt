That's an interesting question. When I think about it, I am addressed more often than my boyfriend, mostly because I am the more social and outgoing person I think. But I do think that there is a built-in default of addressing the man in a couple because of outdated gender ideas. If you are gutsy, you could call them on it next time, like "hey, I'm right here" or "thank you, that's good advice" when they address your boyfriend about you. 

What the clerk did was just really rude, very patronizing, I would be pissed and I don't think my bf would stand for it, either. Maybe talk to your bf about it and point out that he could do something to draw you into the conversation instead of being implicit in their rudeness.
