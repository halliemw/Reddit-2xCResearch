It's probably not deliberate.  It is unlikely that he has any context for processing this information or for how it affects you.  What he understands so far is "/u/imsoconfused12 feels really bad when she eats, so if I support her in not eating, she won't feel bad", which is massively counterproductive, but he has no idea what he's doing.  That's not his fault, and it's not your fault.  It just is for now.
