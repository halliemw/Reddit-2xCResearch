Game development! We also do CG animation and web development to support our products. So the hiring atmosphere is equal parts entertainment industry and high-tech industry. 

I originally came from construction too. GC side. So my entire HR career has been spent in male-dominated industries. I'm happy to say that all of my employers (previous and current) have been extremely supportive of hiring women and accommodating the needs unique to having more women in the workforce (appropriate benefits, appropriate worksites, attention to inappropriate behavior, etc).

Unfortunately, our problem is still that the recruiting faucet from which to drink has water pressure problems. That is, there are not enough women interesting in joining these fields for us to ever hire them at the same rate as dudes. More young girls need to feel comfortable that these fields will be an option to them and do provide a comfortable environment. I fear they get discouraged by their parents and mentors who believe it to all be the wild west and frat house-ish. Those companies are out there, yes, but they are not the norm and many women find happy careers and lives in industries where they might be the only woman around (that's not in a support function). Over time, if more women join, the more women there are! Yay math!
