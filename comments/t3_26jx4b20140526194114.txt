Hey OP, 

This was a great story to listen to and I think it's great you are using Reddit as a way to share your story with other potential survivors. 

If you're interested, I create a forum/YouTube channel for survivors of interpersonal violence to share their stories. I am currently in the works with a YouTube celebrity to start raising money to be donated to charities that work to help survivors of interpersonal violence. If you're interested in sharing your story in video form, or if you just want to check out other stories that other survivors have made, check out [the Outsiders Movement](http://theoutsidersmovement.com).

Glad to hear things are better for you and your friend now. Will be sharing your story with others. 

Best,
Brandon
