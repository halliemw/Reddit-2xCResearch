Hi, thanks for your reply! The place I went to was not Planned Parenthood - it was a pregnancy center near my university. Also, my SO does not know I went in for testing. I think to him, going in for testing even though I'm not at risk (monogamy) or showing any symptoms can equate almost to an admission of cheating (and I am certainly not cheating). I disagree on this. I went in for testing because it's been five years since my first sexual encounter and I have not been tested once and that didn't sit right with me. Also, as far as I know, he does not know how many sexual partners I have had. He has told me his number, but did not ask for mine. We don't talk about past sexual encounters just because like you said, it's in the past and we're focused on each other and our relationship in the present.
