Awww, I know how you feel.  Take however long you need to get over it, and don't try and fight the feelings.  Just accept them as they are.  It's completely ok to curl up in the foetal position and cry.  It will take time.  In the meantime, do things that make you feel good.  Get a pedicure/manicure.  Read a book.  Play your favourite song everyday.  I found listening to they lyrics of songs helped.  Then one day, you will realise how much happier you are without him.  Don't talk to him, and definitely don't be friends with him.  It makes it so much harder to move on (I say this from experience).  And remember: everything happens for a reason.  Think of it as a door closing, but a window to something better is opening :)
