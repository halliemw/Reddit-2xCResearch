I find that I need a mixture of On/Off time with my bra, I'm very large chested so if I just went around everywhere without a bra on it would be *very* noticeable, and probably lead to a lot of uncomfortableness physically. But then at the same time, after having had a bra on all day, that moment when you're home at last at can finally take it off is just sweet sweet relief!
