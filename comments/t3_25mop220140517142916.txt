I'm glad you said something. I think that it's really personal and diagnosing him or telling him to see a "professional" when he's trying to sort through it with me is insensitive. I'm frustrated with a lot of these posts because no one gives me more ideas on how to help him or talk to him - it's all just "see a shrink" or "get him pills" or anecdotal evidence from guys who relate to him. I want to know how to talk to him, how to help him, how to give him the support he needs until he figures everything out.
