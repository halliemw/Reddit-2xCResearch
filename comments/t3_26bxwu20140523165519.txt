I'm sorry that you ended up having such a bad day. I think that the reason it upset you is that, although you didn't get "groped or raped or assaulted", you had a dozen men make it explicitly clear that they were capable of doing those things if they had chosen to. 

Cat calling is a form of bullying. Men never do it when I'm with other men. They are bullies who only do it to women, because they know full well that women are smaller and not as physically strong as them. What makes it worse is that it's not just an act of aggression meant to intimidate, it's an act of sexual aggression. 

If I was a man and I lived somewhere that was full of gang members who always physically threatened me, I would move. But I'm not a man, I'm a woman, and no matter where I choose to live men will harass me on the street. I can't move away from my vagina. I can't leave my vagina at home like I can leave expensive jewelry. 

I'm glad you posted this. I think that raising awareness is the best way to help and this kind of behavior, for now.
