Looking through your post history, it appears that you may be male. If that's the case, then you won't have experienced this, because it is - as the author of that article, and all of the women in this thread have been trying to tell you - *a gendered experience*. The fact that it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean that it doesn't exist (you've never had a period, either, right?), although the fact that you refuse to believe so many people telling you that it does is really strange.

Mansplaining is just condescension that happens so frequently in such similar circumstances with such similar levels of absurdity that we all noticed and said _"Holy shit, ladies, I've totally had guys do that same fucking thing to me too, just the way you described. Why the hell do so many of them DO THAT? I've never had another woman act quite that way, but when the guys do it *it's eerily similar*!!!!"_ so now we have a word for it. 

So, yes. Both genders are capable of condescension. But when you are a woman, there is a particular flavor of it that comes from men who assume that they will know more than you simply because they are men and you are not. It frequently but not always happens with traditionally-masculine-associated subjects, like technology, science, engineering, etc. 

Like... everyone itches sometimes, right? But only guys experience jock-itch, and you all know what that's like?   I've never had jock-itch, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you it doesn't exist.  Everyone can be condescending, but mansplaining is like jock-itch.
