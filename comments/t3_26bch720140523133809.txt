1) His remarks are completely insensitive and show a lack of empathy for the discomfort many women feel when men leer at them.  It's not sexual harassment, but it is incredibly rude.  And it can escalate to harassment in some situations.  The only way I can think to explain it to him is, would he be comfortable if some burly dude kept blatantly staring at his ass and licking his lips?

2) I think the punishment the boy who assaulted you received was disproportionate to what happened.  On the other hand, the boy did cross boundaries and you called him out on it, which is a good thing.  BF needs to look at the full context.

3) It might help to provide overall context for what your ex did.  Not specifying other incidents, but explaining that it was one piece in the overall picture that caused you discomfort.  Also maybe clarify that if what your current BF is doing made you uncomfortable, you would now know better to say so.  As you haven't, and you don't feel uncomfortable in this relationship, he shouldn't worry.  You could maybe also use this as an opportunity to clarify boundaries.
