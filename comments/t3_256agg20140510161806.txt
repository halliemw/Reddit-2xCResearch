Let's say there's a restaurant in my city that I had never heard of, never been to, etc. Let's say they opened another location near me, so now I drive by it on my way to work every day. The chances that I'll end up going there or at least being curious about it are now much higher. Nothing was stopping me before, I just didn't know about it. I had never been there before, but it's not because I couldn't.

There were no barriers in place, people just didn't know about the sub.
