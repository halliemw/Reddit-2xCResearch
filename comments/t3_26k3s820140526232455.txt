>NO guy who talks like that is legit, regardless of whether or not they are mentally ill, or have any violent tendencies.

I think many (most?) people who talk that way do indeed have mental illness - likely in the form of various personality disorders. This shooting, with the release of the killer's manifesto and videos, has been highly triggering for people like /r/raisedbynarcissists. Personality disorders are very difficult to treat, and they don't tend to espouse empathy the way that other types of mental illness generally do, because people with personality disorders can be so hard to get along with.

In the case of this killer, it's quite likely personality disorder combined with other psychiatric illness. Lots of people are crazy enough to have ideas like his; fortunately few are psychotic enough to take those ideas to such extreme.
