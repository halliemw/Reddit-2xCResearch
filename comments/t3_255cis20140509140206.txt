That Atlantic article really spoke to me, especially because when I read it I had just gotten off the phone with a male colleague friend of mine. We started work at the same time and are currently at the same level in our organization, and we had been discussing a recent promotion exercise that was advertised for several levels above us. He said that he was going to apply, even though he wasn't sure he was totally qualified; my reaction was that I shouldn't bother since I wasn't 100% qualified.

Then I read that article, which describes this **exact** thing happening all the time, and realized that the one way to guarantee I don't get promoted is to not frigging apply in the first place! So I threw my name in the ring.
