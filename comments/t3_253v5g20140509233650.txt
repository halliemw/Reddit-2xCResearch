So clearly I am late to the party but I just want to do a little PSA. Antibiotics take away not only the bad bacteria, but also the good that your gut needs. Always a good idea to take probiotics when taking antibiotics to help keep your body well enough to fight future infections. I didn't know this until after a year long cycle of sinus infection, uti, repeat every 6-8 weeks. Of course I was in college and barely sleeping, so that didn't help. Anyway. Best place to get the most effective ones are in the refrigerated section of "health food" grocery stores like Sprouts, Whole Foods, and the like. Oh, and my naturopathic doctor (my source for probitotics) informed me that you want the powder form, not the liquid, because you never get the same amount of bacteria in each drop of liquid due to separation. Get well, OP!
