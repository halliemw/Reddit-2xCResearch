I have experienced guys saying (like you say you do) repeatedly that they weren't interested in a relationship. In order for that to be clear - your behavior has to match what you're saying (which has certainly not always been what I've experienced...very confusing). Also sometimes this is projection, we've heard you, we're good - and hearing you point out that you're not up for a relationship repeatedly is kind of insulting. 
And honestly, people do change their minds about this kind of thing - on either side... and that's not immensely surprising either. 
It is hard for many people to have sex without feelings involved and if you're with the same person regularly, there's even more of a chance of that happening. Your actions say you prefer them to other people, you seeing them repeatedly indicates preference... and then, well, it's never going to be clear cut. Your partners not being upfront is probably not even a scheming thing, more likely - hey, this is pretty good, let's see what happens. And that in itself is not weird or bad or wrong. You may surprise yourself at some point. 
But if you don't want any of the complications, having an ongoing connection with the other person is going to be a problem.
