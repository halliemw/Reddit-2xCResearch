If you're dating a guy who doesn't allow you to talk to any other guys, he doesn't really sound like a good guy. Maybe get him to work through his jealousy issues, encourage him to hang out with your male friends so he knows they're normal nice guys and not secretly trying to steal you away? 

For befriending girls, stop burning bridges with the guys you know, honestly, making female friends is similar to making guy friends, if all the guys you meet think you're a jerk, then they'll tell all the girls they know you're a jerk too. It's hard to just say "I'll only befriend one gender," because you have to be nice to everyone to make friends.
