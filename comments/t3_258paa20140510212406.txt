To be honest, I don't think I'm ever going to think I'm "beautiful." I was more wondering how to deal with the knowledge that I'm ugly without it destroying my relationships. 

I don't look like anyone expects me to look. I take my top off and feel like I've been lying to the poor bastard, I feel like I should wear a sign that says "Ugly Under Clothes" so I'm not tricking anyone into thinking they want to see me. I don't know if I should tell him now, or wait for him to find out. That's the part I need help with.

If you were dating someone deformed, wouldn't you want to know?
