There are medical conditions which can cause different smells, so if this hasn't been normal for you in the past and you haven't changed your deodorant or anything, you might try making a doctor's appointment, especially if you have insurance so it's not going to cost you a fortune. As for your lady bits, discharge is very common and nothing to worry about unless it has a color or it smells bad or "off." In that case, it could be something like BV. You could also bring that up with your doctor if you think it might be the cause. If it's just how you are, which is definitely a possibility, using panty liners and changing them fairly frequently could help.
