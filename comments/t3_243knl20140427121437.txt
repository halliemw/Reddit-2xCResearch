I tried online dating in 2011 as a joke. I used okcupid.com. I didn't take it seriously at all and only did it to talk to new people since I didn't get out much. I worked full time and went to college full time. Any free time I had was spent sleeping, doing homework, and hanging out with my roommate. A few months in I ended up talking to an amazing guy and we actually met up and went out on a date after a couple of months. If I didn't try online dating I never would have found him because he lived in another state where I would have never thought to go. Almost three years later and we're still dating, living together, and it's the best relationship I've ever had (or ever will have). I know it can be difficult for people to find someone online, but okcupid is an amazing website and I highly recommend it to anyone! :)
