I wish I had gotten here earlier! I'm 22, so I always feel that I'm at the point right now where I can see where my dad's parenting hit me the hardest in good and bad ways. Also, I was only raised by my father, so let me assure you that dad's make great parents! 

The biggest thing that I have to say is: as she grows older, and wants to do sports/activities, don't say "you can't do that because you're a girl." I she wants to play football and wrestle, support her in that choice. If she wants to dance and be a cheerleader then support her in that. 

As a young child and toddler, let her know that she can do anything that she wants, so long as she puts in hard work. Don't let boys make fun of her because "they like her", do something about that shit, that's not okay. 

At some point she'll hit puberty and it'll be scary for all parties. Let her know that you'll be there for her and that she can talk to you about anything, and mean it when you say that. Talk to her openly about sex and what it means, and how it's her choice, and that no one should ever pressure her to do something that she doesn't want to. She's 15 and wants to start having sex and brings it up to you? Well, at this point she's gonna do it anyways, so let her know that you'll help her be safe about it. 

Don't make any sort of topic a taboo. What's dangerous about drugs and alcohol? Tell her. Share a story or two if you have them. Tell her what it does to your brain and body. What's sex? Give her a proper explanation (age appropriate, but you can do it without saying 'the stork dropped you off.). 

That's pretty much what I've got to say. Good luck sir! 

**TL:DR**: Support her and her choices, don't define her by her gender, be open about scary topics like drugs and sex, don't try and control what she wants to do, help her be safe with her choices
