I like running and was doing well at it for awhile until life got in the way. I even lost 30 lbs doing it last year. Then I had a miscarriage followed by gall bladder surgery. I tried to tough it through, but it really fucked me up (the miscarriage more than anything) for awhile.

I've been trying to tweak my style and "bring out" my favorite features (hair and eyes) to feel sexier, but my husband is going through some stuff of his own and inadvertently makes it harder. His libido has taken a hit, so you can imagine what happens from there. He tells me I'm pretty all the time, and that it's ME that he loves, not my looks, but I have a pretty fucked up past that gets in the way sometimes.
