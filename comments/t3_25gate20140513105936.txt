thank you so much, that makes me feel better. My initial reaction to something I think is stressing me out is to get away - similar to how he must have felt - but I feel like if I stick it out til I can chill out, Ill feel more confident about whatever I choose. And thank you for the advice on his difficult previous relationship, it's not something I have encountered before.
