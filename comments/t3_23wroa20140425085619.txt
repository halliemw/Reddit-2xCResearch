Yeah as distressing as OP's situation sounds, I just kept imagining my own family making butch lesbian jokes when I came home from school with a new look because I didn't seem too sure about my new pixie cut. They'd get real serious looking and say "We'll accept you no matter what (haircut choices you make)..." and
I'd have hugged them and responded with "Don't be sad, I can always adopt...(kids with better fashion sense than me*)" 

*I actually really dig the fashion sense of the lesbians in my town and would totally dress like them if I had the right build/budget.
