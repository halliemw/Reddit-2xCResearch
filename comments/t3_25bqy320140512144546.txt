I'm with you, more or less. I grew up in a suburb in the KCMO metro and the only time I've ever been even a little nervous was driving through St. Louis. I've been on several mile walks at 2 am, dusk, and early morning, and it's never even crossed my mind that I should be afraid. I was yelled at by someone out of a car one time and I was  angry more than anything.
