I'm so happy that other people caught this. I was reading this and I agreed with some points but I was a little unsure about some of the things the author said, such as this.

Also just to give insight of the thoughts of some guys, and I am guilty of it myself sometimes. It is common for girls to tell guys they aren't interested but that isn't always the case, sometimes the girl warms up to a guy that is a bit persistent however if a girl states that she has a boyfriend/finance/husband that puts her in the untouchable category for me. Granted, I may lightly flirt with her just for fun but I can respect that I can't pursue her anymore. 


I'm a bit young at 20 and have never been to a club but is the hip grinding as an intro thing this common?
