If someone offers you a bite of food and you say "oh I'm stuffed I just ate" that doesn't mean "if I hadn't already eaten, I'd eat your food" but simply that your need for food has been so thoroughly filled you can't even contemplate trying something else regardless of how good it is.  

If you're saying "I have a partner but if I didn't I'd date you", you don't deserve a partner.
