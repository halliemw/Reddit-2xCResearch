I totally agree- though I wonder if that would even teach some people anything. I had an ex-best friend who always told me how working in the deli couldn't be that hard- Then she got her first job as a 'helper-maid' where she restocked the towels in the room and took the dirty ones- that's it the actual maid did the rest; she quit after 3 days and then still proceeded afterwards to tell me my job wasn't hard.
