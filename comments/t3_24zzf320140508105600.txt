I have confidence in myself. I know what I'm doing, and when I don't I know where to go. I am good at what I do. I am well liked and kind. However, I'm going to be meeting 60 people at once, and the feedback from my trainers is that I look afraid, I need confidence and authority. Obviously my self assessment doesn't show through.
