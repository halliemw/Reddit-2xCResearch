I've found fashion tape can do the trick, just put some where it's gaping and it should stay in. My friend at work used to buy men's shirts as she found they didn't have the same problem. It's like pattern designers forget that women have boobs and the shirts have to go over them. Hence why I rarely buy button down shirts anymore.
