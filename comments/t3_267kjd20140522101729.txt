A lot of people are mentioning the "clarity" thing or saying they felt like they were coming out of a haze. I too feel emotional and irrational a lot of the time (I cry at the drop of a hat no matter what time of the month it is), but I've always just accepted that as part of my personality. It's nice to know that it might not be.
