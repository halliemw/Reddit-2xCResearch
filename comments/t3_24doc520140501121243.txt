piggybacking, another sign is male-pattern hair growth or unusually thick hair. beards. extremely thick and coarse arm hair or leg hair. most women grow moustache hairs but its unusual for them to be extremely dark and thick like a man's, and that is another example. My room mate has PCOS and she has a legit beard (she shaves it though).
