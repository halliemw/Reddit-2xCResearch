Maybe I'm just really tired of every conversation and debate being turned into 'but this is so unfair to men' without some men ever contributing or participating in the overall discussion.

Also, I think comments like the one I was replying to miss the fact that tweets like this really aren't the problem. The problem is a society that grooms women to be wary cautious about men, punishes them when they aren't appropriately 'cautious' around men, but cricitizes them when they're 'too' wary. It feels like there's no way to win and the focus is on how we should tiptoe and make sure that men know we're not talking about ~all~ men, while the greater problems go ignored and unaddressed.
