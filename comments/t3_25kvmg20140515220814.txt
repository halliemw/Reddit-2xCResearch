It only becomes libel if you can prove that the statement is both untrue, and has harmed you in some way.

So if you were lying about it, and those lies caused them to say, lose a job/spouse/home/etc, then yes. It would become libel.

It was fairly late at the time, my apologies for not answering your question properly.
