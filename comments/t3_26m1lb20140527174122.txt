Offering to walk with colleagues if they feel unsafe is great, and on behalf of people who have felt afraid walking alone across the carpark, I thank you.

There are other things that can be done, like not tolerating sexist rhetoric.

Things like:

"Well, boys will be boys".  NO.   Not only does that insinuate that men are mindless horndog-bots that cant control themselves (which is a pathetic and insulting notion) it does shift the blame to the female in that instance.  "Well, boys will be boys... she shouldn't have been dressed like that."

Accepting, making, or laughing at rape jokes.  Nope, not funny.  

Catcalling, yelling at women out of cars, following women down the street i a vehicle or on foot deliberately - don't do it, don't allow others to do it, or call them out on it if they talk about how they do it.

Talking about women in a sexual way in the workplace (or anywhere) as a means of insulting or degrading them.  "Oh she's a ball busting bitch, I bet she pegs her husband"  "Our boss is so bossy, she clearly doesn't get laid enough" etc etc.  No, do not tolerate it.

There is a difference between talking about someone in a sexual way that is not to degrade them "She is so beautiful, amazing hair blah blah" and a way that is insulting "she looks like she fucks like a rabbit"  "Oh yeah, look at that ass, i'd pump it and dump it"

"I bet she only got that promotion because she has great tits!"  or "She must've sucked someones dick to become an account manager"
Nope and nope.


Things like:  "Yeah, women shouldn't work out so much, it makes them too manly! Gross"   Nope.
