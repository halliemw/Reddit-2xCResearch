I took diet pills years ago and they were awful for me, my heart would race like I was going to have a heart attack, sweaty, lethargic from the appetite suppressant and not eating enough plus would crash hard off of them or have a hard time sleeping. They are also counter productive to actually losing weight and keeping it off because not eating and basically consuming way more caffeine then anyone should from them means you slow your metabolism down and put fat on. She should really look a clean diet and working out, I do crossfit now myself but any regular exercise helps and let her know her body will change slowly and to not be upset when the results don't roll in quickly.
