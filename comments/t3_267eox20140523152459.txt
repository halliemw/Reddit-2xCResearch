That depends on what you want to do with it. 

If you want to read/write code for your own enjoyment, then yes, anyone that can do basic math and has the ability to read/write a complicated language such as English is able to do that.

If you want to become a programming professional, that's different, because it's a competitive space.

But anyone can learn to read and write code.  And an average programmer that practices every day will be more skilled than a "natural" that doesn't practice.
