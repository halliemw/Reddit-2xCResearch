I agree, should be a private sub-reddit, if reddit-based.

Setting up as a non-profit is not that difficult (and I'll bet there are some legal-minded people here who would help).  This needs a kind of board of directors and some training materials to get off the ground.

Yes, the people who volunteer their homes will have to be brave.  But there are plenty of those people around.  

Some sort of ID system for the women seeking help has to be set up confidentially, that will probably be the hardest part.  No system will be perfect (airbnb certainly isn't).  Skype seems a very reasonable way for people to vet each other.  Anyway - good advice in your post.
