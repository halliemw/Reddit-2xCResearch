Ack, sorry about that. I try to be good about those sorts of things but I'm not always knowledgeable or aware. I was going to use "girl" but the phrase "gamer girl" has its own connotations, and I figured it would be better to not open that can of worms. Thanks for calling me out on it though! I certainly didn't mean to cause any offense.
