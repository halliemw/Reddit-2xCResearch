In my late twenties - female GPs did my pap smears. Hell, I would even let a male GP do one if need be, I'm cool with that. I saw a gynie 14 months after my first was born with suspected endometriosis, but I got pregnant and fixed that. I saw a OB/Gyn for my baby stuff, and he will sort me out with regards to possible endo if I need it. 

In your case, I guess it depends. If you have no concerns, and are not sexually active yet, there isn't really a need to see one.
