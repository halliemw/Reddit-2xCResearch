The issue I have with abortion is when is a fetus considered human? I am all for woman's rights but does an unborn fetus have no rights? What about when someone kills a child by hitting a women and is charged with murder? Is that not giving credence to the life of an unborn child? I am pretty much pro-life but I am open to new ideas if someone is able to convince me that an unborn fetus does not matter.
