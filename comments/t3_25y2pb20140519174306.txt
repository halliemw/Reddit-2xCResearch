THANK YOU for saying this. The article did not give a source for that statistic, and I'm pretty sure that includes mobile games.

I know there needs to be more female protagonists. One of the graphics captions shows Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite, and says that games needs stronger female leads. It's painted in the light that Elizabeth ISN'T one. This idea I find to be as far from the truth as possible. Elizabeth is argued to be an equal protagonist in the main story, and the main one in the DLC. Not only that, she is a main component in the main story, and although she needs to be saved and doesn't fight, she holds her own. We lose our sense of morality for Booker as the game continues on, and her insight and assistance becomes vital throughout the story. Most importantly, we can see and hear her emotions and she becomes a real person in a fictional world. She's the shining example that 1) You do not need to fight to be a strong protagonist in video games and 2) The main protagonist isn't always the person that you're controlling.

We don't always need things surrounding fighting and war. I love platformers and puzzle games. I'd love to see adventure games and story-driven games to overtake the Call of Duty series and bridge the sex/gender gap for girls and help dissolve the idea that gaming is for guys.
