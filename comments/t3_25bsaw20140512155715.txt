I'm sorry for your loss.  My parents are still around but I can imagine losing a father must be incredibly difficult.

I don't know what you believe in terms of an afterlife, but it took me a while to comprehend that she was really gone.  And I really didn't think I had the strength to live in a world without her.  Then I realized that all the things she changed, the people she touched, her impact on the world - all those things are still going.

I'm not the same person that I was before I met her.  She made me want to be a better person.  So whenever I do something good it's at least a little bit of her that's still here.  And in a way, she's still here.

I'm not sure if that helps.  But your father helped shape you into the person that you are today.  So even though he might be gone, his impact on the world is still here.  When somebody is loved and remembered, they're never really taken away completely.

It will take time and you'll always be sad because of what you lost.  But there will come a point when you're able to look back and remember the good things without feeling the unbearable pain of loss.  It sucks to be sad, but remember that the sadness you feel is a result of having something really special.  It's the price you have to pay for loving somebody so much.  And that love made you a better person.

I wish you the best and hope that you're able move past it.  I'm sure your dad wants you to have the best life.
