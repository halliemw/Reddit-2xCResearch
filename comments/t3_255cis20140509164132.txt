It is definitely important to toot your own horn.  But I think there are different, valid ways of doing it.



 I dont think this is a gender issue - its an issue of people not thinking that there is more than one way of doing things right and being a good employee.  Like you said,  I think being a team players is valuable - using the word 'we' isn't 'less assertive', its' saying "I'm awesome, my team is awesome, I contributed to the awesomeness, give me a raise"  Why is being super aggressive and individualistic the ONLY way to be a good employee? I think there is lots of value in being able to work well together with yoru co workers.


Also, wasn't there a study done recently - I wish I could find the article - that men are rewarded for beign aggressive, but specifically women and black men were penalized for it - in fact they were far more like to get the raise if they asked in a meek/apologetic/submissive/self deprecating way.  So what am I supposed to do exactly?
