I'm not trying to be mean, and no you're not stupid....just young and inexperienced.  I really feel for you, that whole situation sucks, no way around it.  I just want you and the other readers of these comments to realize the decisions involved in your situation.  The fact is that there were several decisions you made: 1.) To have sex or to abstain (Yes, I realize that abstinence is not going to happen, I surely wouldn't abstain at your age) 2.) Decision on whether or not to use BC.  (You are 21 years old, an IUD works wonders for millions of women every day in this world) 3.)  Decision not to use a plan B form of BC and cross your fingers. 4.)  Decision to terminate the pregnancy (which I fully support your decision btw).

It seems that many people only look at the decision to terminate the pregnancy as their sole mistake or regret and not the other decisions that led to that.  In your post I didn't see anything included about not using plan B or even a plan A birth control.

There are other women that find themselves in your position everyday.  Perhaps you can turn your unfortunate experience into something positive by being a good advocate for women's health and family planning.
