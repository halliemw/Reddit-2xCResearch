Generations? More like... 1 generation. Maybe two. 

Why aren't men attracted to "masculine" features? And why is body hair deemed 'masculine' when women have body hair too? 

It's not about attraction, it's about not giving a damn. The point of not shaving isn't to be attractive or not attractive. It's just natural.
