I have been active in a few subs that have downvotes removed.  There are multiple ways you can still downvote someone.  You can still go to the user's page and downvote their comment, or if you are using RES you can disable the subreddit style and I believe that will give you the downvote button back as well.

Those subs tend to have a more supportive atmosphere to them, and people are still free to disagree and present alternative viewpoints in reply to those comments.
