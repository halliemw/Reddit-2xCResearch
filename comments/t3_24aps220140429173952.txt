Yeah, there's a line between "bitching" (which, by the way, both sexes do -- if we define "bitching" as just persistent complaining in an immature fashion) and reminding someone of their responsibilities. As a partner, you're also a roommate and you're equally responsible for chores and upkeep unless you have some prior arrangement. If you're supposed to take out the trash, fucking take out the trash. If you're immature enough to expect someone to pick up after you, expect that you're going to be reminded that you're failing in your obligations -- and don't "bitch" about that :P
