> I get that people are upset about his release, but I don't see what they expect to achieve. The man served his sentence, right?

People are upset because, contrary to all their protestations to being neutral and level-headed, they merely want blood.

Beyond that, the article contains no information that's useful.  Generally speaking, in California when a person is put into a mental institution during legal proceedings (e.g., if his lawyer declared a doubt about his competence), he can only be held for as long as he could have spent in prison.

So, in this case, one of two things happened:

1. He ran out the time he could have spent in custody.

2. Or, the mental hospital deemed him rehabilitated.

You have to remember that the likelihood of a sex offender re-offending after he's 60 years old drops off precipitously.  As the offender gets older, due process starts weighing heavily in favor of releasing him.
