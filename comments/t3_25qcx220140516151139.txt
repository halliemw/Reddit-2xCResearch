Oh yeah, I realise that I'm hiding behind this alt - and I'm not denying the negativity that's flowing into this sub isn't real. It is, and it's gross - I just see a lot of hope if we can get through it and back to a decent equilibrium. I think there are going to be casualties along the way to a better reddit and while i hope 2x isn't one of them, maybe at the end there will be something better? It's not the only female space on reddit, it's just the largest and most active. But that can change.
