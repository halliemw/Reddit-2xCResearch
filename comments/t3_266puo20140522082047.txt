I agree with the sentiments here, but I think this is a face to face conversation. Plan out what you are going to say, but saying it in person is usually better than a letter (and definitely better than an email as someone else suggested). You could bring flowers ($5).

I just got married a few days ago, and I was. very sensitive to the costs of having a bridal party. If she is already this extreme about stuff, imagine what will happen when you need to get your hair done, or your nails done. The shoes will be close to $100. Ugh. Back out now.
