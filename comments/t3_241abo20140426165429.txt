Being able to be happy by yourself means you need to love yourself and feel confident with yourself. One of the reasons a lot of people (especially the one still emotionally involved) post breakup feel down and stumble a lot forward is because their SO was their main or only source of validation, the sense of worth and possitivity they should feel in themselves. Post breakup that source of validation is gone and you are left trying to refind something that should already be in yourself.

So you should honestly work on your core confidence and self image. Not only external factors, but preferably internal. Find things you enjoy to do. Find something you want to learn, the sense of accomplishment from mastering something is a great confidence boost. Try affirmations aswell and self help techniques like saying good things about yourself in the mirror and writing down things about yourself you are proud of and like. If you do some great, get a compliment, anything positive, don't disregard it, internalize it as something positive.

Try to always see the positive in things, force yourself into trying things you've wanted. Start to appreciate the little things like the smile of a child you walk by, or when you see someone help the elderly, the song of a bird, the tranquility of water. If you feel tired, lonely, angry or any "negative" emotion, accept it, see why, take steps to turn it around and enjoy the situation instead.

Life is a long road, you get further if you look forward to see all the beautiful and enjoyable things in life.
