Why didn't you just ignore him in the first place? Why did you even bother to put his number into your phone? I get how you feel otherwise though. One time I was walking downtown Seattle with my boyfriend. We were walking up a giant hill. In my peripheral vision I saw two men sitting on a stoop to my right. I was dressed up a bit (dress, knee-high boots and tights) and I expected some comment on my clothes/body as we passed even though I was with my boyfriend. I just got the sense that there were going to say something to me. 

They did. One guy said hey. My boyfriend told me I looked frozen in that moment. Internally, I braced myself for a comment. But you know what he said? They were a gay couple enjoying the weather just like me and my boyfriend and they asked me to take a photo of them. I realized my spirit had been crushed by catcalls and to this day I am working on brushing them off. Now when people cat call me, I smile and look them in the eye. I don't say anything. If they are drunk or look homeless/beaten down, I don't make eye contact but I don't let it bother me. When guys flirt with me in public I smile, laugh, flirt back. But I never take their number or give out my own.
