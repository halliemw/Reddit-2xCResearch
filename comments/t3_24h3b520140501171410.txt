Hi there,

It sounds almost like this could have been my story exactly. My dad died of pretty much the same complications from alcoholism a year ago when I was 21. I was still in college and about to go abroad to study and it was a much more traumatic event than I had expected, mainly because he never really acknowledged that alcoholism was what killed him, it was always "oh I'm sick" or "I'll get better" even to the end. 

After he died I hated that he did this to himself, but I hated even more what he had done to me. He would never see me get married, maybe have kids, even graduate from college. He never once apologized to me or realized what he was doing but that doesn't really matter, I realized. I'm only now starting to see that there was nothing I could do, and it sounds like while your father was struggling you were fairly young as well. That was a time to focus on yourself, your studies, and your life, and it sounds like you're doing great. 

I think there's a way to come to something that is between forgiveness and understanding. I cannot imagine how difficult it is to deal with alcoholism, and it is certainly a lifelong struggle. I know my father did not choose to die and never see the rest of my life or my brother's life play out, and I don't think yours did either. Alcoholism is a downward spiral that seems tremendously difficult to get out of, and I feel I can still remember the amazing things my Dad did for me and with me, but still recognize him as a person who had a serious problem that ultimately killed him. 

Maybe this isn't helpful, but live well and happily and give yourself time. I didn't really start thinking about any of this until a few months after he died. The best of luck to you!
