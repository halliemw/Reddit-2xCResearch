I will say that I know many women who become pregnant, and even follow through with the pregnancy and keep the child, have no attachment to the baby at any stage of their pregnancy and after. I understand some women who even wanted children and suddenly got pregnant and realized they could feel no bond with that fetus. 

However everything he means to me, is not only in my head, but the fathers, our friends, and our family. But I know those are also all things, that not everyone has, or wants.
