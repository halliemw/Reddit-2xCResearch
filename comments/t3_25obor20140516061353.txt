He obviously has no intention of telling her, otherwise she would know already. She has a right to know especially if they have a child together.

I got a lot of random calls and PM's from women back when my husband was dating via OKC, I really appreciated their concern and was genuinely happy that they wanted to make sure I knew what was going on.
