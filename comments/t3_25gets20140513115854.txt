You mean agree with me, I want no other opinions other than those that agree with me. I have news for you, this is real life, there are 7 billion people other than you and you will get other perspectives.

>HAIR IS NATURAL ON WOMEN AND THUS IT IS INHERANTLY FEMININE

&nbsp;

Poor eyesight is also natural and yet we correct it with glasses. Heart defects are also natural and yet we perform surgery to correct it. What you are committing when you say such statements is the naturalistic fallacy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy

&nbsp;

Also if you want to talk about what is "natural" we humans used to be hairier millions of years ago and have been losing our hair all over our body except the top of our heads ever since. If you want to look at hair as a trend, according to our evolutionary trend the less hair all over the body the better.

> Am I alone in my interest in creating a world in which our natural bodies are accepted and cherished as beautiful, even while we maintain our rights to choose to do whatever we like to them?

&nbsp;

If you want a create such a world you had better also do it for men. That means you cannot have any standards for men's physical looks also because all male bodies should also be equally beautiful. You should be open to the idea of dating and having sex with a man that is 5 feet tall weights 400 lbs and is severely deformed. If you could not bring yourself to date such a person than you yourself are a hypocrite, you don't want others to judge you but you are willing to judge others. Secondly, you have always had the right to do what you want with your body just like everyone has the right to think what they want about you. The last thing this world needs is thought police. You do what you want as will others do what they want, don't expect people to like everything that you do.

Lastly, I shave my body hair to exaggerate the sexual dimorphism between men and women. I hold men to certain standards as well as they should hold me to certain standards. Those standards fall along the lines of our sexual dimorphism.
