You aren't going to shame people who enslave women and boys into ceasing their business activities by insulting their masculinity. These people have no shame. They don't give a fuck about hashtags. Fighting human trafficking has to be a joint governmental effort. And if that joint effort isn't strong, it's because of attitudes about bodily autonomy that go much deeper than the insultingly obvious observation that it is wrong to buy a sex slave.
