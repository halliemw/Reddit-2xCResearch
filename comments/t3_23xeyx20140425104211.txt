On the contrary - some antidepressants need months or years to induce the changes that make them so beneficial for people suffering from depression. However I do agree that they should be supplemented with non-med therapies, like CBT. IIRC the minimum time to be spent on an anti-depressant is one year. After that, if the patient and practitioner feel confident, the patient can slowly come off them. If their depression worsens or returns, then they need to be returned to the anti-depressant.

TL;DR there's nothing wrong with anti-depressants for the long term, especially combined with counseling.
