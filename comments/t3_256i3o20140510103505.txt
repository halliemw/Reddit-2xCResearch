Yes, my mother had my younger sister when she was 37 or 38, though my sister admittedly has some developmental issues (who knows if it had to do with my mom's age). I also am open to adoption (which I somehow forget about sometimes), which removes a lot of the biological risks. 

I guess it's also another incentive for me to stay healthy -- if I decide I want kids later, I imagine it's much easier if I'm already in good shape and healthy myself.
