I had slut yelled at me a lot one summer. The thing was I was in jeans and a sweater (it was a cold year). I wasn't revealing myself, it was me and my fiance walking together when it would happen, but never me an my other male roommate. 

We ended up figuring out it was racism. My fiance worked outside and tans well and paired with an olive complexion he was being confused with a native person. My other male roommate is pale like me. We live in an area with a lot of hate between white people and native people and it seems the people thought my fiance was native and me white and proceeded to call me a slut because of it, when with my other roommate no issues. 

It's really sad, it took me a while to notice the pattern (this happened at least 20 times in one summer).
