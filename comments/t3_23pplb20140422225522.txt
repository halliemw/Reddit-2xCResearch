This article made me feel gross. So Mindy's body positivism is "in" because it involved actively working towards making her body look attractive to others? And that attractiveness is predicated on her desire to be thinner, but not "too much thinner", "just 15 lbs"? 

I don't get it. I find Lena's character's freedom with her body to be utterly enjoyable and, frankly, I have happily spent more time being naked and feeling good about it precisely because of her.
