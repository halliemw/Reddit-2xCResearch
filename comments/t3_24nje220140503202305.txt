I got my first period when I was ten, so I was probably in the early stages of puberty around 8 years old. Had my first training bra in the 4th grade, if I remember correctly. I didn't really know much about anything at that point. My mother bought me a book to read about puberty when she started noticing my changes, but never gave me a talk. I guess I sort of just winged it. Mom had stashed some pads in my bathroom for when the time came, and it happened to be at school. When I got home, I dug in, and informed her when she got home from work, and that was that.

I definitely felt alone and was too embarrassed to talk to my mother, so making sure your sister knows she can come to you with any questions without fear of embarrassment is key. She'll probably be able to talk to you about all those awkward things better than her mother.
