Unpopular opinion, but it's silly to say that you don't feel comfortable posting here anymore. This sub has always been publicly accessible, and I'm sure that most people who weren't already subscribed will/have already unsubscribed. The mods' jobs are to keep that kind of stuff in check, and they have always done so, it's not like it's just now started being a necessity.

Reddit is a public forum, and posting here now will not be any different than before, in that you are posting anonymously on the Internet, and anyone can see it. Imagine how many people browse /r/all and see posts from this sub on a regular basis. It's not like we were unplottable before now. 

I really like this sub, too, and I like the type of community that it's grown to be, but I really think everyone is overreacting about the default issue. I'm sure plenty of women will be introduced to this sub when they may not have otherwise known about it, and that's a good thing. Just as in any other well-moderated sub, if you see something inappropriate, report it and move on. That's just how it works.

I'm prepared to be downvoted into oblivion, but I don't care, because I think a lot of people are acting like grumpy children about this. There has been no change in terms of who is *able* to access the subreddit, and for that reason, I don't see why anyone would feel any differently about posting here. Additionally, there are plenty of decent, well-meaning guys out there who will likely use this sub as a way to better understand women, which can only be a good thing, IMO. Don't condemn every outsider based on the behavior of the few who are behaving badly.
