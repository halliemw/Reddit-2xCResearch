I have a mooncup uk. I got it because pad adhesive can really irritate my skin and tampons can be irritating internally. It was also cheaper in the long run. I love it and now that I'm constantly just barely spotting from the my mirena(I know it will stop eventually) its great that I only have to worry about it once a day.
