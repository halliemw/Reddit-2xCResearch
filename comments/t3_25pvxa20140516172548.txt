Image Fest Friday.

Think of it as friends getting together over coffee and showing each other pictures that mean something. "Heres a picture of the two most important men in my life"... "Here's me and my sisters at my baby sister's wedding"... "Here's the latest project I've been working on, I'm thinking of starting a business selling them"... "Here's me after winning my award at work" etc.

Each photo's comments are others sharing their tangically related experience for each pic, spurring discussion. It's like show and tell and it's a common typical thing girls do when together. We don't just sit around talking about our boyfriends and our children, despite what movies would lead people to believe :)
