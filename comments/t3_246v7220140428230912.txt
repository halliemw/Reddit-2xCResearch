As someone who suffers from depression, I sometimes find it very hard to make appointments and do follow up.  I think its worth asking him if he'd appreciate you doing looking up the info.

I do think, however, that you need to tell him that you're not okay with him going back to grad school because you're overwhelmed by working two jobs and going to school.  

Its like, you're willing to be sympathetic and supportive when he needs time to recovery (physically and psychologically), but if he needs to recover then its not appropriate for him to start graduate school.
