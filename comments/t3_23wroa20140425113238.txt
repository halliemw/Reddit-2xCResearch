It's just that this little thread started out with straight people admitting crushes on same sex characters from childhood, so it was a strange thing to then have someone say, "But you gotta admit it's a classic sign".

'Cuz apparently there are exceptions aplenty.  Damn labels and expectations - no straight person likes everyone of the opposite gender, and I suspect that sexuality is a bit more fluid than we tend to admit.  And there's likely a big difference between liking a cartoon character and getting butterflies around real live people in terms of predictive power, not that children should be analyzed so closely necessarily at all.
