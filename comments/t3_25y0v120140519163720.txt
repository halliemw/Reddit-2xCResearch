I wouldn't say this is the most stressed out I've ever been, but there's a fair amount of it. If anything, it's more of an emotional, rather than school-related, stress. And I guess it started around the time I lost my virginity, so I guess it could be causing this...

As for eating properly, I don't count calories that much, but I'd assume that I do. I try to balance meals, get all the needed nutrients, and eat right. I have been losing weight, but not at all drastically. Probably 2 kg a month, at most.
