I have the same problem. Whenever I compare my measurements to those of mainstream shops, I feel like some kind of strange mutant, even though I feel like I look normal? A size small will be something like 34 bust, 27 waist. I'd wear a 34 bust, 25 waist. That's enough of a difference to make a fit look poor...

I think your best bet would be to find something that fits at the bust/shoulders and then tailor the waist. From when I worked in a clothing store, that alteration would be $15-20.
