I'm sorry that this plagues you so. I'm sure he won't think anything of it. Lots of women have insecurities about all sorts of vaginal things. To wide, to long, to fat, longer labia minora. The list goes on and on and on. But the reality is, we shouldn't put this much pressure on ourselves about the way our vaginas look. Your boyfriend is not going to think about it as much as you (or really at all). He will be focusing on what it does, not how it looks. And for the record, not all guys have porn peen either, and they have all sorts of insecurities on their own. That alone should inform them that there is vaginal variety. If he's expecting yours to look like a porn one, then he's an unevolved jerk. ANd I don't mean to make light of your insecurities. It will be fine, and he will be fine, and he will think you are fine.
