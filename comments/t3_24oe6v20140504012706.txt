Frankly, I think that balancing all things is extremely mentally exhausting, which is why I suppose that "having it all" is something that should be evaluated on an individual basis. I don't want a career (am more of a downshifter), and don't want children, so I get to balance work and family much easier.

Choose the things that are the most important to you and try to make a plan on how it'd be possible to balance them. If it seems too difficult, cut out parts of the equation. It might become easier.
