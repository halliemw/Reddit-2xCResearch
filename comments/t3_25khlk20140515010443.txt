"And, while of course I had heard from women all my life about subtle (and not so subtle) misogyny -- and I believed them, I never really thought they were exaggerating -- it's very much a different thing to experience something than to just hear tell about it."

I believe you, and I think this is pretty common.  AND, it's sad.  What is it going to take to eradicate misogyny? It's not enough for us to talk about it and explain it? Men have to experience it to truly "get it?"  Damn!
