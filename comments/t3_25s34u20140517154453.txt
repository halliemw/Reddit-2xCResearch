I'm going to try talking to them and hope they're reasonable. I might do what /u/still_me suggested and offer to pay rent and stay here until they can find someone to move in. That way we could both be looking for someone to take over and it would double the chances. They *said* they have a waiting list so it might be easy. 

But the other part of me has been dealing with these greedy bastards for a year and knows that I live in student housing. These landlords generally do not care about individuals, just money.  So we'll see.
