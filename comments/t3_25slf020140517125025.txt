I was a teacher's assistant in middle school for a classroom for kids with autism. I felt as though not only was I being bullied but so were the kids. I began to take down records and have the other TA sign and date it. At one point the male teacher who is quite large and older than my father (I'm 23, he's in his 60s) had me in a corner with his finger in my face and was fussing me out in front of the kids. I reported it. They did nothing except move me into the ISS fulltime. Needless to say, I went to another district. 

They didn't fire the teacher until a kid's mom found out that he was letting the kid sit in his own shit too long then showered the kid on a daily basis without parental consent. The other female TA had told the teacher that he needed permission slips and the mom asked us not to change the kid because he had hit puberty. It was up to the male TA and teacher to do it. Yet my report about this and the teacher taking children with special needs into the bathroom to show his belt to kids he knew got hit with the belt went unnoticed and I was holed away.
