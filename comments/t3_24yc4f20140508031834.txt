And what's odd (to say the least) about this is that she, a professional working as an abortion counsellor, used the very least effective birth control method even though she was highly sexually active. You'd think someone who is exposed to this on a regular basis would know better than most. And yet she's shockingly irresponsible. Before I watched the video and read what she wrote about it, I was really surprised that some people believed she had intentionally gotten pregnant just so she could get an abortion. And I'm really disturbed to say that I am no longer surprised by that. She comes of as really superficial and naive in how she treats the issue. 

And yes, I am vehemently pro-choice. But I also believe a potential human being's life should be highly valued, which is why I think any sensible human being should reserve abortion as a method of last resort and instead be throughly aware of and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy by responsibly using birth control, firstly. I don't see how, for example, someone could be proud of calling the fire brigade when their house is on fire due to their own lack of foresight and proper judgement. 

Again, given that she's supposed to be a professional working in the field, her irresponsibility combined with her attitude is odd, if not shocking (and repulsive). She comes across as shallow and immoral. She's like a fireman who's house caught fire because she didn't look after the meat grill properly, and then brags about how her local brigade managed to put out the fire safely and in due time...
