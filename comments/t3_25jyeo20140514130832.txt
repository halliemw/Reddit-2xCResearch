I definitely wont respond to him, I never do. The thought of actually communicating back to him makes me want to throw up. I'm afraid he's going to get in contact with people I know. I was on a date when all of this popped up and I had to tell my date a guy was stalking me and he just followed him on twitter. Thankfully he didn't asked for more of an explanation and just blocked him.

Thank you for this. I feel better knowing it's not just me, I can't really talk about this much with my friends.
