Hi, I'm a 16 year old guy, and last Sunday I was told that my moms cancer got moved to terminal. She could pass any day (hasn't yet) but could, possibly very soon. Thanks for posting because reading this made me feel the love that your mom had for you, and, in turn, my mom has for me. It was uplifting in a time of need.
