If you're after strong female leads in a fantasy book, I'd say give Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy a go! It's a great series and an easy read, and the lead character is a girl who turns into a confident woman. Plus the system of magic in the book is totally awesome. If you need any more fantasy suggestions I'd also give /r/fantasy a go, they're a great community and always full of suggestions!
