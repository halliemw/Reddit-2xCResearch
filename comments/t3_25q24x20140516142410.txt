Agreed with /u/namegirl. It works on regular acne too. I follow up my face wash (using the [oil cleansing method](http://www.thankyourbody.com/oil-cleansing-method/)) with a toner of diluted witch hazel and apple cider vinegar. It's possible that all that's overkill, and maybe I could remove one or two ingredients, but whatever, it's working. I have a perfectly acne-free face for the first time since puberty. Seriously, not a single zit in sight.
