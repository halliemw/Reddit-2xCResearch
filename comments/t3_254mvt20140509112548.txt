At least it shows the variation tough? i wouldn't say I looked much like any of them either.

Is it worth looking at lots of different images to get a better impression that isn't skewed by media etc? 
I had the same worry as you do but after a while I learned to appreciate it. It might also be good to talk with your boyfriend about it? If you think you could? (It will probably be hard to talk about I know) 

It took me a while to get used to my body, and I actually didn't realise a lot of my really good traits, as I figured they were normal before. When I get stuck with these issues I just try and do research around the problem. I want to help but I dunno what to do.
