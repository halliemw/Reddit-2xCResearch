I was the first and only woman in my family to nurse. I did it despite the ignorance and ridicule OF MY OWN MOTHER who, as I was discreetly covered-nursing her first grandchild, " Oh that's disgusting!! Go do THAT out in the car, don't do that HERE"! Oh, ok Ma...I'll go to a dark 110 degree parking garage and sit in the car alone instead of this nice bench at the mall. An mind you, 100% covered. It's cause she KNEW what was happening!!! No support whatsoever!!
