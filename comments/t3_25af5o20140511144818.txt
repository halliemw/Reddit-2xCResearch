I'm sorry for your loss. I hope that the baby book will continue to bring you happiness when feeling down. I am thankful to still have my mom; she is a single mother, so we were always pretty close. I am not at all looking forward to the day I lose her, I will be wrecked.

I'll send you some good vibes this Mother's Day. :)
