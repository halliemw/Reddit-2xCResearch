From the outside, there are quite a few. There is amazing literature, excellent cooking techniques, unparalleled religious contributions, music, spiritual concepts, huge personal contributions by Indians in almost every reach of world culture.

India is not the only place struggling to culturally adapt to worldwide standards of humane behavior. That doesn't excuse the problems, but it's not worth throwing a rich, artistic, scientific and emotionally intelligent culture under the bus.

At least, to me. But as I said, from the outside. All I can do is share my thoughts.
