Since I'm logged in here with a throwaway anyway, I'll cop to this: on occasion, I sometimes pee a little by accident, and I'm in general good health, according to my doctor.  I've had this issue since I was about 25. My doc told me to do kegels to help reduce the chances of this happening, but said that it's pretty common.  Like everyone has said (and like you know, I am sure), it's probably well worth going to a doctor, but at least in my case, apparently this is sometimes just a part of being a girl.
