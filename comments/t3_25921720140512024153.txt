 Use it regularly. I had somewhat damaged hair from dying and it was instantly more shiny after one use. You need a proper shampoo (not something sensitive/no-poo) as it will fail to remove the oil but otherwise - warmly recommended. 

I now have natural hair color and the difference is less obvious but it really gives my hair volume in a more manageable way (my hair is neither frizzy nor curly but sort of messy and resistant to being brushed straight. I can brush it for an hour and it still folds back into bed hair. Just the stupidest hair consistency ever).
