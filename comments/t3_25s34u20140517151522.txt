I see a psychiatrist for general depression, and when this happened we talked about it a while. I mentioned I had heard he was try to lease across the street at my last session, and he told me we could talk about options more next time (in a couple of months). He hasn't moved in yet, he'll move in later this summer. 

I have never really confronted him. I know he knows what he did was wrong because the morning I woke up he begged me not to tell anyone and there was enough physical trauma that there was no way it was anywhere near consensual (I have no recollection of the night so I'm not sure how he was acting). I told him it was really wrong and he tried to tell me it was ok and we could still be friends if I didn't tell anyone (my boyfriend specifically). I told my boyfriend and told him I would no longer be friends with him after the way he took advantage of me. He tried to contact me to apologize multiple times but I have not answered him.
