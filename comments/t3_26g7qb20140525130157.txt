Hi. I hope you are feeling better now. Sometimes I get very affected by my periods and sometimes barely. Btw, that movie could not have helped. I hope you do not have a mother like that.

I do not want to project, just explain how I feel about these episodes, maybe you will find it useful. They are definitely not fun, can be very painful and are looked down on but I feel like they are a window into dark parts of my soul. Parts that I push away to be able to function. And as long as it is time limited and you get out of it, I welcome them. It is cleansing. We all have those feelings. Will I ever be happy, life is hard (because it IS), but there is somehow not so much space to express them out there so we repress them. But period unleashes something and then forces us to go through this. It sucks, it is very painful, but I really think it is part of being human, feeling all these things (as long as one does not get stuck there - even then it is human, but then one needs help to get better), I find that it helps me connect to myself. 

Anyways, good luck on your spiritual, monthly, emotional cleansing trip:)
