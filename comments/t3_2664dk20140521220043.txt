Not the OP. But to me it's a complicated topic. I have no problem with the idea of beast feeding, nor visible boobs. What makes me uncomfortable is idea of someone sucking body fluids out of someone. Of course I can't rationalise it, so my discomfort is invalid. However I can't ignore that there are other activities people do that also have no rational justification, but the discomfort of it is widely socially accepted.
