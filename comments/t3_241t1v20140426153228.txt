30 is definitely not old.  It's a great age to be!  The whole decade is great, and 40's is pretty awesome too.  You're old enough to have some wisdom and life experience and young enough to enjoy it to the fullest.  30's is still young and glamorous and vibrant and you should absolutely pursue living in your dream city with a job that suits you.  Go get 'em, tigress! :)
