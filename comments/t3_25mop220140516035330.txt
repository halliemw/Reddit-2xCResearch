I relate to a lot of your post. 

My SO is very well liked, insanely successful, handsome, and smart. However, nothing is ever enough. Ever. He was raised in a strict Asian household. I know his parents are proud of him, but they do their best not to show it when he was younger. They held him to impossible expectations, and he kept meeting them. He's at the point now where he's doing so so well but he can't be happy or satisfied as it's not "enough". He always points out the ways he could've done better. (Ex. He had to take a test at work and got the highest score anyone had ever received. Ever. In a global organization. What does he fixate on? The two questions he got wrong. "I should've studied more. There was no reason to get that wrong") 

Like you said, I spend a lot of time trying to build him up. I even give him build up through my mother as I know it means a lot to hear a parent say their proud. However, now it's definitely taken a toll on our relationship. Since nothing he does is good enough...and he does so so so much more than me, it makes me feel awful. Awful that I can't reach his standards. Awful that I can't make him happy, because he'll never be happy.  Awful I can't give him the things he wants. He says he doesn't judge me that way, but I know he does.  

It's hard, because I do love him, and I think in some ways he'd make a great husband and father. But he is all for raising his children the way he was raised, because he can't see how much they messed him up. 

Sorry, for the vent. Needed to get that out.
