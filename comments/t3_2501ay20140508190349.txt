ah but how many times does someone check their phone when you are about? Just peak over their shoulder a few times and you have it!

Also (I have only tired this just now on my SO's phone that has no pass code and I don't have a phone myself to try it on so sorry if I am wrong) on an Iphone you can take photos without unlocking. From the camera screen, you can go to their camera roll and can delete photos at will :) *


*Annnnd I just tried it with a password and it did not work... sorry! I thought it was all too easy ;)
