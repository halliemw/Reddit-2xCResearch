I've been hitting up the new tab as much as I can to upvote stuff, but a lot of the more normal threads are getting lost in the downvote brigade. The gross stuff has caught some momentum, but we need to get some upvotes going on the more normal stuff as well. At least the top threads aren't entirely "this is horrible! vote here if you wish you'd been consulted before twox became a default"
