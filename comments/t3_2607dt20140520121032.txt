Cramping and spotting are very normal, and different for every woman. I would suggest taking Ibuprofen (as long as you do not have any contraindications to taking this medication) for the next few days if you are still experiencing regular cramping. Also a heat pad or warm bath might feel good. Perforation generally occurs upon insertion (although it is extremely rare). If you can feel your strings coming out of your cervix, this is a positive reinforcement that your IUD is in the right place. If you continue to worry though, call your provider!
