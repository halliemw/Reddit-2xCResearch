You mentioned kitchen knives in your original post, but I'd advise against going for that if you don't know much about using a knife for self-defense. While you decide what you eventually want to do about a weapon of some kind to feel safe, I recommend a baseball bat. It's handy, pretty cheap, doesn't look particularly weird in a house, you can keep it by the bed, and it's a midrange weapon that is scary looking and you don't need any special training to fuck someone up with one if need be.

Something like a mop/broom handle can be handy as well, but won't offer the sort of threat a nice, heavy baseball bat can.

Sorry you went through that. Stay safe!
