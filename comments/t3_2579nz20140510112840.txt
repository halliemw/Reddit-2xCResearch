>All in all, if she feels that she is not safe she does need to talk to the authorities at school, or to the police if things escalate. But, it cannot be left to just saying that he is just being a "little creepy" or "juvenile"

This is because she needs some prospective that the weird kid is not a threat and this happens everyday without people being hurt or jailed. He is avoiding her a school. Years down the road she will realize how trivial the whole encounter was. I know I have. 

I once had someone crushing on me that I thought was weird. Poems were written. I was asked out multiple times and there was even inappropriate unwanted physical contact. At the time I was unconformable but I wasn't being stalked. 15 years later I realize how silly the whole situation was. If I would have contacted the cops the weird suitor may have had their whole life ruined. For what? What would that have been accomplished? My weird high school crush has a family now and a good job. We laughed about the whole thing at our 10-year class reunion.
