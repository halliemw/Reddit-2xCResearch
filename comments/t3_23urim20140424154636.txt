Go with your heart. Do what you feel is what's best for you. Most importantly don't ever let anyone put you down or try to degrade you for YOUR decision about YOUR life! No one knows you better than yourself. No one else knows your story. You do what's best for you. You'll get through this and only come out stronger. You have a whole life to live. Don't ever pity yourself. Love yourself but most importantly don't ever let anyone put you down, including yourself. This is YOUR Body. <3
