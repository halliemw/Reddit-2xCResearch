Yeah, SRS (prime anyway) is a circlejerk, but as far as feminism's problems go it's pretty low on the list. Personally it was a relief for me, after seeing so much shit on reddit, to find another group of people making fun of that stuff in a trollish way. Maybe I'm just the sort of person who deals with stress and anger by being obnoxious and sarcastic? I don't know. Sure, it's not for everyone and it's probably not great for feminism's "public image" or whatever, but not everything can be a PR move, you know? Sometimes you just need to vent. 

SRSQuestions and SRSDiscussion are pretty decent for actual discussion, but equally hated among the rest of reddit, it seems.
