I have felt the same way lately. It just feels like everyone is *so* angry. I'm a woman, I don't hate women, but we are all separate humans and are not going to agree on everything. I have been personally attacked a few times for various opinions, and it's perfectly fine if someone doesn't agree with me, but there's really no need to be straight up nasty to one another - doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of this place? I actually started writing a similar post a few weeks ago and chickened out from sharing it. I'm glad someone else feels the same way.
