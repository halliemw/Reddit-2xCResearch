A few years ago I could have been writing this. People in my work life often comment when they see me in social situations how different I am... I was also traumatized by childhood bullying. 

It's gotten a lot better! I credit 3 things:
1. Creating a social circle where I can slip on what I mentally call my "work hat" when I go out and things get awkward. It started out accidentally - I started a blog about my city and made a reputation as a niche subject guru of sorts. I met people who were into the same topic - so when we hung out I kept my professional hat on and we always had lots to talk about. They had reached out to me as sort of fans/fellow enthusiasts, so I think I always felt like there was respect there and I knew where I stood and felt socially valued. A few years later I have this fun, quirky niche group I've kind of collected and we hangout fairly regularly. I have somehow never felt anxious around them. It also should be noted that the people I get along with best are also introverts who see my awkwardness for what it is and not misread it as rudeness. 

2. A good therapist. She helped me see moments where I could use the assets I do have in social situations more effectively, and problem solve ways around the roadblocks that trigger me. 

3. I can't stress this one enough. My significant other is a huge support. It's taken a decade and lots of me saying what I need but whenever I get anxious or nervous ahead of time he is a great cheerleader to help at least get me out the door. He prevents me from allowing my fears to mean I never leave the house. 

Good luck!

Ps
One thing that really helped me change the way I thought about my situation was reading about social role valorization theory by Wolfensberger (sp?).
