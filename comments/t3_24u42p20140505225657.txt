First, have you taken any over the counter medication like monistat for that yeast infection yet? Probably a good idea to try that first since that's probably all PP will suggest to you aside from testing you for STDs (which you should do every six months or before getting with a new partner anyways if you're sexually active)

Second, if you're in college, have you gone to your school's health clinic on campus? Your tuition covers most if not all of the treatment they offer.
