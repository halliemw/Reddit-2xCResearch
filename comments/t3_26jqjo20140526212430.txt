I always like to go out to eat with a coworker/potential new friend. For one thing, it puts you in a new environment, so you can see them outside of work and see if you'd want to be friends with them. You can also talk about non-work things more freely. For another, it gives you something built in to talk about, like "what are you going to get?" or "i found this place when i was doing x" or "I really like spaghetti but after I had it in Italy I'm spoiled" which can be used to transition. Then you can ask what they think of their food, and look, almost time to go back to work! After you do this a few times, it could become drinks after work, then maybe hanging out on the weekend. Hope this helps!
