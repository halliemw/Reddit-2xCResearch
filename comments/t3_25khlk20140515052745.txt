From the post:

> How much of them can be attributed to hormones, and how many can be attributed to living as a woman and truly experiencing the social pressure, etc, of that role? I can't be sure. Certainly, I feel like hormones had a large effect on many of them, specifically those that deal with my own interior experiences and reactions to things.
> But I don't like to say it was all hormones, if for no other reason than I know plenty of cis women who have had estrogen-driven bodies all of their lives who don't necessarily have many of these going on in their lives. But, for whatever reason, they are a part of me now, and a part of my experience of the world.
