I know exactly how you feel!  Only my downfall had been romance novels, not Disney stories.  I would lie awake for hours picturing my perfect life. 

I can't say how I got to the point that I realized that life wasn't a fairy tale or a romance novel.  It just happened.  I don't know if it's because I had a couple difficult relationships that made the great one that fell into my lap.... so easy.  It's still work.  A lot of work.  There are arguments, occasional tears.  But in the end, communication, compromise, and love for each other make us work at it and appreciate what we have.  

The biggest thing for me was after a long, drawn out just "OK" relationship, I realized I was strong enough to be on my own.  Forever if need be!  A man would not complete me.  And then I met a man that complimented my life.  That was my life changer.
