Walking in downtown Minneapolis by myself usually results in about 5 catcalls a day.

That the only time it ever happens to me really. But thats also really the only place I ever walk around. Otherwise I'm driving.

Sometimes in traffic a guy will pull up next to me, honk his horn, wink, etc. But thats less common.
