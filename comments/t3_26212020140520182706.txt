How is it sactimonious?

You've posted questions in a quantity far in excess of "a few." The mods have responded. There are no new answers. The sub will remain a default until they feel the experiment has run its course.

It is hardly "love it or leave it" to ask you to wait two or three weeks. Clearly they're accepting advice and making changes.

I was simply pointing out that, if you feel the changes are so terrible, you have the option of going elsewhere rather than shouting into the wind. At this point the posts complaining are more obnoxious than the troll posts because at least the mods remove those.
