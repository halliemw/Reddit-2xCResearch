Since this is a default now, and a controversial one at that, please be mindful of things like [geotagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging) in photos. If you've taken photos of yourself (or someone close to you), geotagging allows someone to see where you took that photo. If you took it at your home... well... I'd think twice before posting it, if that concerns you.
