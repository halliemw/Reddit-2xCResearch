Hmm, sperm bank is not a bad idea! Yeah, I don't feel ready for kids right now, but I want to have them in the future. It's just that I think about the fact that a man's lifespan is on average shorter than a woman's (still have both of my grandmas but my grandfathers passed away some time ago). And I would want my child to have as much time with his/her father as possible. Absolutely, I agree that conditions have to be right in every way to have a child.
