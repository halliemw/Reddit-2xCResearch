>Is that okay? Will it be awkward? Am I supposed to bring someone?

It's *perfectly fine.*  

The only reason to bring someone would be to make sure you have someone to talk to and hang out with, since it sounds like you don't know many other people there, besides the bride.  If you're comfortable mingling with people you haven't met before, no reason to bring anyone. 

(The bride will be incredibly busy, so you probably won't have much time to actually talk with her, ironic as that is.)
