I think the problem with this shirt is the gross exaggeration of the meaning of the phrase on the shirt. I'm involved behind-the-scenes at several nerd conventions, and I have heard the phrases "fucking fangirls" and "I hate fangirls" come out of the mouth of many a female con staffer.

It has nothing to do with women being real fans or real nerds or sexism or anything. In that context, it is almost always referring to a specific type of fan who can't see 2 males in the same location without pairing them, and who often like to do things like argue loudly (and when alcohol is involved, sometimes violently) about the correctness of their ships versus other peoples', and to hassle cosplayers (of both genders) portraying male characters to make out, feel one another up, etc. Maybe that's not what the shirt meant, but that's the only context I hear complaints like that about "fangirls."
