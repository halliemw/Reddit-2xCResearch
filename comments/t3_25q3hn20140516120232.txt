Hi! I just approved this, just giving you a heads-up that if you edit your OP it will get caught in spam again (it's because of the URL shortened link, I think).

I don't think a poll can be remotely accurate because of authentication issues (people can double vote, the sample isn't going to be representative, etc) *but* I'm interested in seeing the actual comment replies to the post :)
