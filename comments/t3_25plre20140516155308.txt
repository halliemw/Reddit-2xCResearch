I know that r/nosleep has a rule that all posts are to be considered true. It's a fiction-writing sub, but for it to work, they say no-one is allowed to question the post (such as loopholes, etc.). Why not do that here? For example, in a rape post or trans post, comments that question what the OP is saying wouldn't be allowed.
