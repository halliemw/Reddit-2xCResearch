Don't overwelm yourself trying to go for beautiful.  Maybe try baby steps, everytime you look in the mirror you're "not allowed" to say what you don't like, and you are "required" to point out one thing you really like about yourself.  Even if it's little... "I really like that my ears are even and level," "I have a super adorable chin...".  Things like that.  Being nice to yourself is a habit, so do little things that break the habit of being cruel to yourself.
