I've just been through a period of several months of applications and interviews, and screwed up plenty myself. The best advice I can think of is - don't just apply for the jobs that you really want. If you can afford the time, apply to anything and everything that's even remotely relevant to your skill set, and use them all as practice for improving yourself.

With every job I applied for, I realised more skills I had based on each ad's desirable qualities, and could therefore improve my resume and interview techniques with each following round. Not every application led to an interview, and not every interview progressed past the first round. But some did, and this gave me the confidence to keep going and helped me reflect on what I did better this time than last time.

Plus, some of the jobs I applied for looked great on paper, but didn't sound great after the first interview (remember that you're interviewing them, too). Others sounded average on paper, but I had a great rapport with the interviewer and liked more about the company as I heard more. 

Interviewing is like any other skill; you'll get better at it the more you do it :)
