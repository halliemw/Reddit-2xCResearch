Regardless on whether or not the men were guilty of the crime, I don't see something like this ending well. Even if the list started out with actual rapists, what is going to stop someone from adding a name onto that list simply out of spite? Innocent mens' lives would be ruined and would likely hurt the story of the actual victims (who will believe them after word gets out women were just adding their ex's to the list or something like that?)
