Honestly, yes, many companies do feel it's unprofessional.  It depends on the hiring manager.  There's mostly older people doing the hiring in the majority of companies.  It also depends on your field.  As a hiring manager dealing with the creative side in our company, it wouldn't effect me, but I can say with certainty that it would effect every other hiring manager in our company.  Some would have a personal reaction to it; others would worry about the reactions of our customers.

I don't think "Absolutely not" is an appropriate reaction to a fellow adult regarding their own body, but in terms of his general point - yeah, I think he's right.  It won't mean you can never get a job, but it will have an effect at a lot of places.  If they can't see it, that's a different story.  But that's kind of a pain in the neck in warm weather.
