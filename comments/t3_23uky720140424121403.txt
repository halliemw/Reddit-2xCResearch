Eh, I find the best way to deal with flakey people is to acknowledge what they are like and find ways to deal with it in my own mind. If you expect this girl to behave like you would (or a normal person) you are going to be disappointed, so continuing to have these expectations is only hurting you. So I would assume from now on that your friend is going to be late or bail on you. I would use that when I'm deciding whether to hang out with her. Say she wants to meet at a certain place for coffee, I would think, "Well is there anything to do around there that I would like to do if she doesn't show up?" If the answer is no, don't go. If well, you know there's a theater right there and a movie is playing and that could be fun...I'd go for coffee, drink a coffee, and if she doesn't show up in 10-15 minutes, I'd go do my own thing. If that's too much work, I'd say fuck her and just stop making plans. I would not however have some kind of come-to-Jesus conversation about her character flaws. She knows already. 

I guess part of it depends on what kind of relationship you want to have. This girl isn't ever going to be good best friend material. But if she's fun and you do have a good time when you hang out with her, think of her kind of as like a fuck buddy sans fucking. You don't have obligations to one another and that can be liberating for you too.
