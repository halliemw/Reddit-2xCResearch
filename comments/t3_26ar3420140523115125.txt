> Do many companies still feel that visible tattoos are unprofessional?

Yes, a million times yes.  

Reddit is hyper-liberal and "non-judgmental" and doesn't really represent how most of society feels.  Most people, especially in the business/corporate world, look down on tattoos.  Tattoos, at least in our culture, have come to represent non-conformity, a "free spirit," rebelliousness, and "subcultures."  These are all things businesses aren't interested in.  They want somebody who will put their head down and do their work, and people with tattoos have gained a reputation for not being that. 

And whether or not they see tattoos as unprofessional, they will definitely judge you for them.  You can't control or predict people's quiet judgment, and if times get tough, you may get axed and never know why. 

And its not as easy as "covering them up" either.  You have to keep in mind that its difficult to cover them up every single day. Also, what if you get invited to a pool party or something?
