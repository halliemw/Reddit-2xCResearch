Out of curiosity, did you go to the police back in the fall when all this happened? If there's a record of what happened, that'll certainly help you out if he becomes a problem again. Does he know you're living there now? 

Either way, make sure you're honest and open with those around you about what happened, if you haven't been already. That's the best protection you could give yourself right now.
