Cops hang together.  I taught for 10 years at a police academy.  They hang together.  

Most cops are decent, but they are all briefed by their commanders and they worry a lot about what cases will "make it" with the D.A.  They don't get raises/promotions from irritating the D.A.

D.A's are elected.  We need more women to become D.A.'s (or men who realize priorities should favor certain crimes over others).
