I dunno, I think its pretty obvious to most people that sneakily taking a picture of someone in a sexual/unclothed context is a scumbag move. We don't call them "misunderstanding shots." The word "creepshot" is unambiguous. 

Now, I agree that labeling people as purely good or purely bad based on one action is unhelpful. I think we should judge people's actions in their individual context. This guy could be a model citizen in every other sense--kind to friends and family, volunteers much of his free time to worthy causes, donates money, adopts strays, etc.-- but could still do a shit thing. People are complicated. 

I think he's well aware that creepshots are creepy, because everyone knows that, but valued having a candid picture of a naked lady over her rights. When people act selfishly, they know what they're doing is objectively wrong, but they just don't care. Explaining to him why its a violation of privacy could get that through his head, but if he's at the point where he does this then I'm not sure it'll work. 

OP should still have this conversation though, and record it, for the purpose of clearing up what happened. And to have evidence later on, if further action has to be taken.
