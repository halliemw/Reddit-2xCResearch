Seconding the first two paragraphs. From experience, I know that complimenting the body of someone with an eating disorder is likely to result in either 1) them thinking you're lying to make them feel better, or 2) them believing that their methods are working and continuing what they're doing or getting worse. Calling a doctor is a very solid idea. Eating disorders are very tricky to deal with, and a professional really should be involved. I've had one, and I still have to be very careful to filter my reactions and respond correctly to others who are struggling.
