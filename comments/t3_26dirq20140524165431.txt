My understanding is that in the past (and still today), people have emphasised women's roles in typically male-dominated industries as a way of correcting past wrongs/prejudice against women - e.g. check out [womeninmusic.com](http://www.womeninmusic.org/) (Women in Music is a dynamic group of individuals in music working together to support, cultivate and recognize the talents of women in our field). This is often a good way to make sure that minority groups (in this case, women), feel supported and validated in their chosen field or industry.

However, modern views of feminism seem to be that often it is better to NOT mention women explicitly because that it makes it seem 'not normal', and just highlights the difference between women and men in that industry. So I think Playboy took the view that women in music should be celebrated by highlighting women in music (fair enough), while Neko Case took the view that women in music should be 'normalised' by not mentioning sex/gender (fair enough).
