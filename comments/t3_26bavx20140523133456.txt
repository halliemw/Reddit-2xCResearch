> I truly think he doesn't even realize he did something wrong.

this this this!

This guy is not a monster. We don't need to demonize him. But he is, right now, probably a rapist. Defnitely a sexual offender, based on your description of how he groped you. THIS is what people mean when they say "teach men not to rape!" He doesn't know that is was wrong, but someone really needs to tell him. 

OP please, if you can, make sure he understand how wrong this is. Use the words rape, sexual assault, if possible. Obviously, I'm not advising you confront him if you don't feel safe about it, but he will continue to keep doing this if no one speaks up **clearly.**
