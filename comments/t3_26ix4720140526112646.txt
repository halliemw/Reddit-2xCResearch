> He's unemotional except for his anger.  Might start throwing things, yelling, slamming doors.  He'll get upset with me being emotional.  He'll yell at me to stop crying.  Extremely hard to share things with him.  A lot of times he just won't respond at all.  

Those are all emotional abuse red flags.  Please get yourself out of this situation.
