I get that but if you read the quote it certainly sounds like anything said by a man that isn't a question is "mansplaining" which is stupid, but it seems like everyone disagrees with me on that, oh well. You really can't see that the over-use of that term could be discrediting any argument without actually having to argue against the points they made?
