I think it's really important to be ok with your body hair because it's a very important form of body and self acceptance. I really hate hearing that it's "gross" for women to have visible hair on the armpits, upperlip, legs, etc. Yet somehow it's totally fine for men? 

I've had friends in the past be grossed out about my reluctance to shave, and they've joked with me about it, but being concerned with body hair (especially someone else's) has always seemed like a sign of glaring insecurity. It makes me feel like those people are deeply unhappy with themselves and can't quite accept or appreciate their bodies, and it kind of makes me feel bad for them. It's like, a cultural obsession they can't quite get past, and it's a bit tragic.

I'm lucky in that I'm dating a guy that truly does not care about where or how long my body hair is. The first time he saw my body, I hadn't shaved my armpits or legs in months (kind of a personal protest that lasted about 6 months). I'm delighted to say he was more than just ok with it. Most guys I've been with have never said anything about it to me, but I guess it's just been a self-selecting group :)
