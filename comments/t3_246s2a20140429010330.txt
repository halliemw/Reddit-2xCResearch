> Tris has one especially unique fear, and itâ€™s an important one: fear of sexual assault.

what....? when did that happened? she has a fear of having sex basically... with Four.  and i guess the night she got attacked, Peter "felt" her body and you could say she was bothered by it but um that isn't really "fear"...
