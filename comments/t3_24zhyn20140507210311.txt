Oh god, I have the best dad in the world. He was the youngest of all boys and I'm pretty sure he didn't have any friends, let alone lady friends.

But he has always been kind and patient with all of us(one boy, two girls) whatever we were interested in he would find himself interested in. He was always taking me to do things just me and him. Even when I was a shitty 12 year old and the only thing that I was willing to do to spend time with him was for him to take me to the mall - then to the mall we would go. It seemed like he had endless time for me.

He hated when we watched too much tv, always encouraged us to play outside, we constantly fought over drinking a glass of milk with dinner (gross) and eating just one more bite of broccoli. 

My point is this - my dad was an awesome dad.(still is, but I'm a married lady so he's can't make me eat my vegetables anymore) It had nothing to do with my gender. It was completely dependent on his absolute love for his kids and our best possible outcomes as his priority. 

He has definitely told me that he was never confidant in his parenting skills. I'm sure he had insecurities that I don't understand and some of them had to do with having girls when he had no experience with that. But I can say, as the outcome of his parenting experience, he was awesome. 

Don't pull any bullshit moves with your daughter. Just be the most loving and supportive version of yourself that you're capable of and you're set.
