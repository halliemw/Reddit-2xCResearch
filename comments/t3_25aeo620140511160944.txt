I don't think it would have been different, other than maybe it would have been a little easier to diffuse from the beginning if we had shared a language. I think it's a cultural/economic thing and I mentioned it because it seemed pertinent to the discussion. It's a pretty well know fact that women are treated differently in the middle east than they are here and I think that might have something to do with openly asking someone a question like that.
