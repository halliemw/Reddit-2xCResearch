I love my parents but I have no interest in being their friends. My stepmother and my father just think and act nothing like me. In fact I gave (and alwYs have had) a disconnect with my entire family. I somehow grew up with a very different set of views on life. Some things are the same like caring about people. But overall I love knowledge and to challenge myself and my mind and abilities. They don't. I questioned life early.... They couldn't even understand my questions. This isn't just my perspective either. They (particularly my older sister and father) straight up told me I make no sense to them. My sister literally said she understood half of what I said as a kid. "Everyone else asked why the sky was blue as a kid, you asked how did we know it wasn't green." So, I never formed a true bond with my blood relAtives... And I don't care. If they need me I'll help and if I need them they are there but I have the people I chose in my life to understand and be friends with. I kinda learned to like that.
