Ah, I hadn't noticed FreeCookies response. That is interesting.

With regard to the rest of your post, it sounds like we're in agreement.  I think airlines should generally have a right to limit behavior to fit in accord with people's comfort, but that right has to be weighed against other factors.

For example, if I want to fly nude for funsies, airlines should prevent me from doing so simply because it makes other passengers uncomfortable.

However, as in your post, if someone wanted to prevent black people from sharing a bathroom with white people, airlines should not comply because that discomfort has to be weighed against the morality of equal rights (and currently the laws of equal rights as well).

Similarly in the case of breastfeeding, the discomfort of passengers has to be weighed against the importance of feeding a baby.
