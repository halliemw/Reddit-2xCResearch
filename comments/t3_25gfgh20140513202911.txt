I gotta weigh in here :)

As a fat woman, how I feel about myself is a more important factor in my attractiveness than my actual size (18 Australian).  Once I stopped acting apologetic about my size and forgot I was fat, everyone else around me seemed to do the same.

Clearly I am a well-rounded lady and this is not a case of pretending to be thin, but rather the acceptance that I am pretty cool as I am.  When I stopped hiding behind the "they will judge me/not like me/make fun of me because I am fat" mantra that played in my head 24/7, I was able to relax and be the fucking awesome, cool, funny, weird, earnest, silly girl I am.

We fat ladies (people) need to stop thinking for other people, stop projecting our own limiting beliefs on to others.  I have been thinner, I have been fatter.  But I am never more unattractive than when I let myself descend into bitterness, resentment and cynicism.

If I am looking for love (even just some hot crotch love), I can find it.  When I look for people to reject me, I can find those too.
