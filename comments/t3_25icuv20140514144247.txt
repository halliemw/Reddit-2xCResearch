What are clear and unambiguous signs though? What seems clear and unambiguous to one person may appear ambiguous and opaque to another. Or what is friendliness may appear to be invitation to someone else. I'm not saying OP shouldn't feel uncomfortable with what the guy in her story did; she was there with her boyfriend, and the guy should have understood that and kept his hands to himself. Also, having the first real contact being hands to ass is tactless and doesn't speak well for him.

But for all that... the signals that people send to communicate interest differ by such huge margins that saying
> People need to learn to only start physical touching if they have clear and unambiguous signs that it is wanted.

is far and away easier in concept than in practice. Let me make clear though: if the recipient of the touching shies away from the contact or asks the one touching to stop, then any further attempts to make physical contact absolutely would be unacceptable.
