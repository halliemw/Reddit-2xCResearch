Read your healthcare coverage manual.  What does it say?  About the provider, about the diagnosis code?  Every health plan is different, and each one covers different things.  You need to read your plan.  

Your provider can use a different diagnosis code if they really want to be helpful, there are so many codes they have to use the exact right one that is *covered under your plan.*

Your plan will have information on how to resubmit and appeal when necessary.  

EVERY PLAN IS DIFFERENT.  If you want certain kinds of coverage, you research and buy the plans that have it.
