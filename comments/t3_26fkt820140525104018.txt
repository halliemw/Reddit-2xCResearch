So I'm not saying you should beat up any guy who hits on you, but you might want to look into a RAD course. it not only teaches you how to defend yourself, it introduces you to the very police officers you would have to go to if guys ever got more aggressive; and it might give you the confidence to say no and call them out. Sometimes you really just need confidence to be able to turn guys down and if you haven't had that experience then this might be a fun way to acquire some. Plus you can meet other girls in your city or take it with a friend or female relative!
