There is a rather large gulf between "not always interchangeable" and "operate very differently."

They have vastly different histories, for sure. After all, black men were allowed to vote after slavery ended, but women didn't get that right for another 50 years.  Ditto for owning their own property.  On the other hand, slavery is rather hard to find a counter to.  SO yes, different history.  But no, not so different that you cannot use them in an analogy.
