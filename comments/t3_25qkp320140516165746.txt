We should be outraged about the murdering of all people regardless of their gender or sex. Violence doesn't discriminate. Don't forget all the male soldiers that are dying in Syria trying to protect the cities from ISIS and Al Qaeda, or the male soldiers who died fighting trying to stop Boko Haram, etc.
