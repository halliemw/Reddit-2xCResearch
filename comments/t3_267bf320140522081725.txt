I agree with this, and when "radical" feminists can sometimes include real life violence and hatred, people are going to automatically think that is feminism in all it's glory, because that's all people see.

A lot of people also see some feminists as internet crusaders, not actually willing to go out and do things, instead, sitting on places like facebook, reddit and tumblr telling other people how they should be living/existing, but not doing a damn thing to help themselves.


Also, personally, radical feminists include TERFS. And they're all assholes.
