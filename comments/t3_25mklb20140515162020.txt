That doesn't matter. If I got a position at 50k (while lower than another person) and go and ask for 70k (because I found out what someone else made), I shouldn't get canned for it. That should be negotiated...isn't that what negotiating is??

The issue at hand isn't, IMHO, her salary. It's that she got canned for asking for a raise. So in this instance, she *did* negotiate and got fired for it.
