Yes! Bring a ziplock bag, and maybe brown paper bag (or plastic grocery bag) to put the ziplock bag in (since it's clear). Bring a few ziplock bags if it's going to be hot, so you don't have to deal with the smell of days-old used tampons, and pack them out when you're done.   
When I went camping with a group they gave out dark brown ziplock bags to the girls for tampons, but I have no idea where they got them. Maybe at an outdoor store? I'll have to check next time I'm at REI.
