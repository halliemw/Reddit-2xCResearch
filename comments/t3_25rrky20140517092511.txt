>I suggest instead to carry a knife.

I highly suggest not carrying a knife unless you do follow through with knife-fighting classes. If you don't know what you're doing, and someone larger or stronger than you attacks, that thing is going to get taken from you so fast.

I carry a knife occasionally (I work in a govt. building and can't carry a weapon day-to-day), but that's only because I've trained with knives for years. For someone who hasn't trained with it, it's not really a better bet than pepper spray.
