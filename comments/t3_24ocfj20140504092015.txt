I figured as much, I just can't figure out why it's inconsistent-- maybe the absorbency isn't right sometimes? Not relaxed enough? I just get annoyed cause it makes me feel like I'm relearning how to use tampons! I'm a grown ass woman, damn it. Love the fact that there's less waste/bulk though, which is most of the reason I use them.
