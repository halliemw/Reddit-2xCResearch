If the story is about Ellie saving the world, why are you forced to damn humanity by saving Ellie's life? Why else would the game start with Joel's daughter dying (who is the same age as Ellie)? Why would Ellie tell Joel about her survivor's guilt in the last scene? Why would Joel lie?

Ellie's immunity to the fungus is a mcguffin, just a means to develop their relationship. This could be set in Nazi Germany and Ellie could just be jewish and this story would still work.
