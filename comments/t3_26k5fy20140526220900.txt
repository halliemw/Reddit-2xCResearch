From other sources 22% part time for men vs 44% for women.  And its almost certainly 4.5 hrs per week. http://m.amednews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20120326/business/303269974&template=mobile_art

An interesting Canadian study (sorry don't recall the link) found that hours were only reduced for women who were married and especially with kids - makes me wonder if better support / equality in society as a whole and there would be less disparity. 

Still - I find it interesting that most of these women don't drop out of the workforce completely - vs lawyers and other high intensity professionals where complete dropout is more common, medicine actually does fairly well.  More flexibility, at least in some specialties.
