As a Syrian/Irish hybrid, I can relate to this. I haven't had too much of an issue with hair removal because my "happy trail" is manageable and my all-over hairs aren't that noticeable, but I've always been self-conscious because of it; the fact that body hair started growing on me before it did my friends, that even though I shave my armpits regularly, it always looks like I have a "five o'clock shadow" underneath, and how my bikini line always, always shows small dark hairs. 
I'm not sure where I was going with this, but it's good to know there are other pale, dark-haired people out there.
