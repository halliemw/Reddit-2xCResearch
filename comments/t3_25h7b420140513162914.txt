Canada and Britain are fatter than Iceland. It is likely that good health care in the US would bring the death toll down there too.

I've lived in a part of Canada with no doctor within driving distance, nurse practitioner only, only nurses when she went on vacation. That kind of isolated community would be more likely to have more deaths due to complications.
