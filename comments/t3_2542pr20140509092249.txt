A few weeks ago I stumbled onto it, was reading through digesting information as you do on the internet. "Okay, some of this is BS, hmmmm that sounds plausible, what does this mean? " and then I found a comment that was like, *women are scared all the time because they know they are only protected from rape, kidnapping and murder by thin Social rules, that could disappear.* Personally I like to think the majority of human beings m or f are not capable of the malice it requires to inflict such pain onto another human being.
