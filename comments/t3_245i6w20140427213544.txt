There's not much you can say. It's something she has to work through on her own, unfortunately. You and your wife can only lead by example and try to remain positive about your own bodies. You should also try to help her find clothes that fit well, because that makes a big difference in how you feel about your body. Tall sizes are hard to find but as she gets taller, they'll be the only thing that fits her right. I know many stores carry tall sizes online even if they don't have them in stores. You could also try cross-posting to /r/tall. Some of the ladies (and men, for that matter) over there may be able to help you out by sharing their own experiences.
