My opinion? Breastfeeding is the best for a baby. Formula doesn't have the same nutrients, it does provide a better bond with the mom, and everything you need is right there.

However, there are people who can't breastfeed. They are often shamed because they physically can't do it, and it's horribly wrong and rude to do that to someone. Not breastfeeding because of this is okay.

There are also women who choose not to, for various reasons such as involving the father in the feeding process, taking medications that they fear could harm the baby, and because maybe they want to be able to eat or drink what they want and don't want a mini human latching at their body every two hours or more. And that's okay, too.

So tl;dr: breastfeeding is good, but not breastfeeding isn't bad.
