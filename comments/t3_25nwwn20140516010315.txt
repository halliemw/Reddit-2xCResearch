Yes.  Unfortunately.  There appears to be no lower level for weight that will keep some people from thinking it's a good thing to be even skinner.  Wait, there's a quote ("No one can be too rich or too thin"?)

It's a kind of social "anorexia" complex, in which even the painfully skinny are told by others that they are great for losing even more weight.  Watching a situation like this at work rather carefully (I know the person pretty well, she's amazing, but...I also know she has an eating disorder, as she's described it, so every time someone tells her she looks great for losing weight, I cringe).

She's a grown-up woman, though, and dealing with it (with help of family closer than I am).
