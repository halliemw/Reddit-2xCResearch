Well, I don't think you can be completely invested in two things at once, that's paradoxical. So I don't understand how anyone can expect to put their everything into a challenging career and always be personally available to children when they need a parent. Something needs to give. But not constantly being available to a child doesn't make someone a bad parent, and taking a day off work shouldn't mean your career is in jeopardy. There needs to be a support system and some safety nets when you want to do a lot in a short amount of time. I think that's where things unravel.
