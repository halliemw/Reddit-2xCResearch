> looking at my life and realizing that I would not be the person I was (nor have met my now-husband) were it not for my mother's death.  
 
Again, same boat. I wish I could talk to my mom but I'm not 100% sure I'd give up everything I am to have her back. Her death, my families struggles, my stepmom, and all that has happened since then has made me who I am. I don't let "dead mom" define me but it's part of my identity. And yes, it sucked being the only kid in middle school with a dead parent, but as you said, everyone loses someone eventually. It sucked being the one kid who was forced by life to grow up a little faster than everyone else, but now that we're all adults I feel like I fit in again.
