Thank you for taking the time to read it. I often wonder why adults show shocking lack of judgement. A few of my friends have cited 'curiousity' as a reason. I don't care how 'curious' someone is, though. Curiousity and wanting to get educated are two completely different things. Curiousity is no excuse to make others uncomfortable.

Again, thank you for reading and for your kind words. :)
