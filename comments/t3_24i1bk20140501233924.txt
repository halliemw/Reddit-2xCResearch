I had one removed by a GP who I work with because I know he's very skilled at sutures. I would typically not have a GP remove a facial mole though, I would go to a plastic/cosmetic surgeon. The scar is going to be smaller/better typically with a more skilled doctor/nurse doing the suturing. Naturally there is also the risk of hypertrophic scars however if you don't already get them the risk is low. 

My scar is hardly noticeable and with time it'll fade to nothing, it's only visible as it's new.
