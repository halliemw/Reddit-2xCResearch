I go to get cut/color the day after I washed my hair, so the longest it would be is about 30 hours after washing. I don't want to wash my hair twice in one day since it looks stressed out if I do that, and he usually washes my hair after coloring it. Should I wash it that morning anyway?

Since I've been having this problem getting the color to take, after getting my hair colored, I don't wash it for 48 hours. After that, it takes up to a week for me to feel like I'm not pulling dye directly off my scalp. I typically wash my hair every other day (or in rare cases every 3). I'm not particular about shampoo brand, but I'm buying the ones that say they're for color-treated hair. I do not use any product on my hair except leave-in conditioner and the occasional hairspray for special events, and I air-dry my hair 99 times out of 100, so it's not getting a lot of heat treatment.

I'm going to talk to him again about all these issues and see if he can get better coverage next time. (I have been mentioning to him that some hairs are not colored when I get home, or a couple weeks later, so he was aware. But I'll mention it again.) If I can't get a handle on this though, I'll have to at least try someone else once to see if there's a difference.
