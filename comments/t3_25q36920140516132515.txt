It was a fundraiser where we met at a park and biked downtown with ~400 people. Everyone dressed up and there were a few places where we stopped to regroup and have impromptu dance parties. When we got to the prom venue there was music, food, drinks, and a photographer to take these lovely photos.

[The Bike Collective](http://www.bicyclecollective.org/) here does great work getting people, particularly kids and immigrants, bikes so it was even for a great cause!
