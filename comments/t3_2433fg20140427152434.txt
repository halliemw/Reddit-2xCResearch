Right, because woman in scrubs = nurse and man in scrubs = doctor.

I had a patient Friday who tried to get my attention by saying "Hey Girl!".  I reminded him that I was Dr. Sunshine and he corrected himself, and then tried to get the nurse's attention by saying "Hey Girl!".  We could blame the anesthesia, but I don't think that was really it.
