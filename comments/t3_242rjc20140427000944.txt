There's sort of a "rapey" scene in season 2, it isn't too graphic, but it's strongly implied.

Norman's mother suffered abuse, sorry for the slight spoiler here, and it's brought up throughout the show. 

The 'sex slave' story ends with season 1, and it never gets too over the top. It never shows the actual abuse or selling, only the slave with cuts/bruises and you can tell she's very emotionally damaged. It also shows her reaction when she sees her captor/rapist.
