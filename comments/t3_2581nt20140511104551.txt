Some people who have been certain for almost their whole lives do change their minds but I would rather someone regret not having kids than having them (and so many people regret having their kids) so think people should be allowed to choose sterilisation at any time once they are an adult. Even if you have had kids it can be difficult. My brother has had two babies but can't get the snip easily until he is 32 (he just turned 28)!

I don't want kids. My fiance has had the snip now and it's SO awesome I never have to worry about having children. If I change my mind well again I'd rather regret not having them than having kids and realising it's not for me.
