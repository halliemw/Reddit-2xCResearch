One thing you could do, if your mom calls you again, is to tell her what it is that you want -- for your dad to recognize that what he did was wrong and to genuinely apologize to you about it.  You could decide for yourself if you were willing to tell her that you'd drop the charges if he did that.

If you do wish to have any kind of relationship with your parents in the long run, both sides are going to have to find a way to get past this -- this means them apologizing, and you forgiving (but not forgetting).

Getting yourself into a financially-independent state is obviously crucial no matter whether you plan on forgiving them or not.
