I chose pills because I was only 15 and at the time, it was my best option.  I suffered from 11-14 day, heavy periods and experienced lots of cramping and blood clots.  I also had severe PMS.  I chose Yasmin because it was the least likely to make me gain weight.  I have been on bc ever since and have 4-7 day, light periods with PMS consisting of easy emotional upset (MUCH better than before bc).

Aside from a patch, I do not trust other forms of birth control in terms of safety.  I am very sensitive and would rather not risk cervical or uteran complications.  I also do not feel comfortable with the idea of reducing my menstrual cycles to only a couple/year.  Menses is another way by which women eliminate toxins.  It is healthy to menstruate every month.  

Back in 2007, I switched bc pills because my insurance was no longer covering Yasmin for some reason.  I switched to a version that only varied by a few mcg in Progesterone from Yasmin.  Within a month, and without any dietary/stressful changes, I gained 40+ pounds.  As soon as I went off of them, I began to shed the pounds.  Like I said, I'm sensitive.
