I agree with this. Often times I'm not really downvoting disagreement per say, but content. If the content is violent in that it enforces sexism, racism, or any other kind of oppression, then it is unwelcome. If it's sloppy/unthoughtful, then it's not contributing. It's never really about dissenting opinions to me, all speech has content!
