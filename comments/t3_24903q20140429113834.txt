I just read through that script and it specifically says grandfathered plans are not required to cover the services. This is the case with my plan. I work for my county government and contraception is not covered. Not only that, I have a high deductible plan so it is full cost. Waiting on open enrollment... hopefully it becomes 'ungrandfathered.'
