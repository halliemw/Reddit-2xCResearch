Thanks! I majored in English, because I dropped out of teaching. I chose it because I wanted to make a difference and that seemed like the best way to go about it. A couple of years in I realised that all the red tape and regulations were going to make that difficult, and I wanted to be more frank and down to earth than most school systems allowed. I dropped the teaching part and just finished up my arts degree. 

Next year I'm going into social work and I'm really excited! All it took was doing a bit more research, because when I started uni I had no idea social work was even a profession. I wish I'd done some more volunteering or been happy to study part time to take some pressure off.
