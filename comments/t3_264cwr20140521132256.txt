He is playing a classic game of wearing down your self-esteem and keeping you off balance so you never feel secure and safe in your relationship. He is either doing this deliberately because he thinks it is the way to keep a woman (and sadly, it is, just not how to keep a woman and have a healthy relationship) or because he is just naturally a douche. If you have told him it bothers you and he makes no effort to stop or dismisses your feelings, this is not a relationship worth continuing. Get out before he makes you feel any worse.
