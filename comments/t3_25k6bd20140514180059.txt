Where I'm from, they're pronounced the same. At least, I've seen people handwrite them differently but say them the same and I only learned that they're "supposed" to be pronounced differently because my dad isn't from the region I grew up in. If you aren't a native of the area or haven't paid attention to how people read things straight from a paper, it could be a pronunciation thing rather than actually using the wrong title.
