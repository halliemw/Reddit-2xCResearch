For both genders: How drugs affect the brain and how addiction works. Not in a DARE, "if you ever do drugs you're gonna die" kind of way, but just actually explaining how dopamine and serotonin work, how using drugs changes your neurochemistry, and how these hormones are related to addictions. This is an age where kids are being exposed to drugs, and a lot of them are probably like I was at 13 and believe that drugs like marijuana don't affect their brains. Informing them on what is actually happening, and showing how they can release the same pleasure hormones through things like exercise, laughing, etc could keep a few kids from making the wrong choice about what they put into their body.
