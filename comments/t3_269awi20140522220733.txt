Don't feel guilty. If you can't feel signals your body is giving you, how could you have known there was something wrong? Now that you do you are trying to help yourself. You are learning. That is how life is. We all make mistakes and it is because we do not know everything in advance. When we learn knew things, we act on them and that is what you are doing. You are in a shitty situation, but it is not your fault. If you can in any way, diminish feeling guilty. Just focus on taking care of yourself. One step at a time. And be patient with yourself. You need to learn all these things despite the fact that you get less signals from your body than most people.

Can you get therapy? I really like yoga and you can do it at home, you just need to look for youtube yoga videos. You can do 20 minutes every day. I find that it helps me unfreeze my feelings and puts me more in my body. Any kind of physical activity is good for putting you in your body (speaking from experience). I also like dancing. If you can get some lessons like zumba, modern dance, or go to contra dancing, it would help.

Eating is hard, I haven't figured it out for myself. I cook very rarely, I just try to make the best of the limited offer that is financially accessible to me. Chipotle's burritos/burrito bowls have a decent amount of vegetables in them and are under 7 bucks. Also, for simple meals you can buy vegetables and tofu (I am vegan) or meat and just stir fry them.

Meditation might help you too, you can find simple instructions online or even guided meditations. On youtube or other places, e.g. Tara Brach has a website with lots of meditations.

Good luck and take care. This can be a very good thing for you, this is a chance for you to learn how to be good to yourself, to do all these things that soothe you and nourish you and that in itself can be very powerful and liberating, in my opinion.

Big hug.
