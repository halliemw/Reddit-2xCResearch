i agree with your statement. so i used a bad example. lets instead call this fight for racial equality "africanism" and only talk about the issues of black people. lets only talk about the oppression of black people while claiming it is about racial equality. lets not address the inequalities experienced by anybody else. 

my point is that if you exclude any groups oppression than you cannot achieve equality. you can only achieve equality by considering everyone who you want to be equal. and you can't do it by only considering negative or positive things. you have to take everything from everyone into consideration if you want to achieve equality.
