I suspect you are looking for more, and more control in your life, of everything and everybody.  In many life circumstances, "leave well enough alone."

The next time you feel the need for change, go find your boy friend, and describe to him how you are going change up your sexual positions, and then show him.  Ask him to f you to death every time you feel this way.  See if giving up control changes how you feel this need to 'change'.  You'll soon see this is about 'you wanting control' and you can defeat that, mentally, as you sound like a smart, wonderful gal, and will make the right choice.
