In all fairness, this is supposed to be a place where women are allowed to express themselves freely. However, joking about rape or making analogies using rape would not fly here. It's inconsiderate and seems to be a pretty well acknowledged rule. If another woman posted a rant about a final exam and said "That test raped me. I failed. I don't know what to do" I could easily see it being removed by the mods (and if not probably heavily downvoted).
