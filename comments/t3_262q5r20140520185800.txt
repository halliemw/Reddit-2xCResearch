I mean you owe it to him to at least tell him. What you did was really irresponsible and unfaithful to him. Now you carry his child and depending on his principles, that could be a huge deal for him.

I know for me, being pro-life, it would break my heart to know that a friend made me feel safe from pregnancy, when in reality it was completely untrue. It breaks everything I stand for because I otherwise wouldn't touch someone without proper contraception because to me a life is something that is important, especially my own child that is my own flesh and blood. 

I'm not going to tell you what to do with the child, but I hope you understand where I'm coming from. At the very least he deserves to know.
