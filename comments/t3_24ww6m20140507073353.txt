I imagine he had to stop aside his concerns for your personal space to...you know...try and feed himself.

Edit: I amazed people are so annoyed at this.  Maybe he should have kept his distance even though she was in a car. Maybe he should have waited until you're outside a coffee shop. But I imagine you know absolutely about being on the breadline - about being really scared. Not just because some knocked on your window whilst you're in a car, but because you literally haven't eaten in days and your stomach is started to cause you to shit blood.

He didn't assault her.  He didn't invade her space - she was in a CAR.  If this is how human interaction works how, then let's all stay at home and communicate via the internet (and ONLY the internet).  Jesus...I surprised this didn't have a 'trigger warning'.

In the UK we feel guilty when we don't give tramps money.  We don't sit there whining about personal space.

I hope OP, that if you're in a similar situation one day, you'll find kindness in the arms of strangers.  Rather than contempt.
