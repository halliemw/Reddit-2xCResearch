This sounds psychological to me.
I was not an early developer (I had breasts at 9, but I think that was largely due to being overweight), so I cannot say for sure, but here's the thing: I was a victim of abuse. The obsession with cleanliness, change in eating habits, and mood swings could all be signs of abuse. I'm not saying they are, I'm saying they could be. It could also be something else psychological.
You say you want to be there for your sister and that you're pretty sure she'll come to you, but the only way to really ensure this is to talk to her about it. Tell her you want to be there for her and that she can talk to you about anything and that there's nothing she can say that will make you feel badly about her. Talk to her about your own concerns (but in general terms). And most definitely have her see a doctor.
If this is puberty, the doctor will be able to confirm, and as other people said there are things that can be done to help her. If its not, you want to know that as soon as possible.
