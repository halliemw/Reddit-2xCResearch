I got the mirena in January. I'm a bit over weight so my doctor warned me about the bleeding. I bled up until march then I had a normal period then in April I got my period but it still didnt end. I'm still bleeding. Its very light though, with a few flows of blood here and there. I never went to my doctor for a follow up I know its really bad but I was in between jobs, had no money for my co pay, and have no car. I'm SOL right now but bleeding is completely okay. If you have severe severe cramps and it moves up then you can have problems but if they feel menstrual than that's normal. Give it time, peace of mind out weighs the side effects. Trust me :) oh and I never had kids either if that helps!
