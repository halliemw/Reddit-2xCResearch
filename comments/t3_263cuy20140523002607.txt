Find some girls in class and just talk to them. At least, if you want to avoid the guys in case they hit on you.  I have a similar problem after being disconnected with most of my friends. I can count my close friends on one hand: one is my mother, one is my ex, and one is my boyfriend. But I recently started talking to a couple girls I know from work and actively asking them out to drinks or dinner. It's very awkward for me, but I think it's paying off. The key is to really go beyond the talking stage and make it clear that you want to spend time with them.
