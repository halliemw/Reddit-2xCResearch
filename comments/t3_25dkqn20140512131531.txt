To figure out the the risk, Redelmeier and his team analyzed the medical records of more than 500,000 mothers in Ontario. They looked at data for each woman for five years: four years before the baby was born and then a year after the birth.

During the first trimester, the car crash rate among the women was about the same as that before the pregnancy. The risk then rose by about 42 percent during the middle three months of gestation. During this period, about 0.8 percent of the women visited the ER room because of a traffic accident.

This is a studied link between an increase in car accidents directly attributed to a time frame during pregnancy, and a significant one at that.  If there is a further link, it needs to be identified and clarified.  Obviously this is one study but it's enough to at least warrant some concern.  It doesn't say they are incapable.  They say hormonal/physical issues caused during the second trimester increase risk.
