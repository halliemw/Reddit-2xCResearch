you may have been ahead of your peers. there are studies that show that empathy doesn't really develop on a meaningful level until between the age 13 and 16.

girls develop earlier than boys by about 2 years. this is my biggest pet peeve on trying children as adults in a court of law. it shouldn't be allowed until after the age of 16, AND it should be at the age of consent (since this is essentially the same question, "is this person old enough to be expected to be able to make mature decisions that have life long consequences?"). i don't think this question can be answered as "yes" until at the minimal age of 16.
