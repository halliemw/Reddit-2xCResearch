But...why? We're women, periods are a natural part of that. I do try to be respectful of other people's homes, and if there's visible blood I'll pile some toilet paper on top because blood *is* gross and it smells, but if there's no visible blood I just wrap it once and toss it in. I see no need to hide it like I did something nasty. Smuggling it out in a purse seems both unsanitary and a tacit agreement with the perception that vaginas and their natural functions are disgusting and shameful. :\


Note: I'm a tampon user. If I were dealing with a messy pad, I'd wrap it better and/or take out the trash. If someone has a dog, I offer to take out the trash and have no problem explaining why. Most moms are comfortable doing exactly that with a dirty diaper, why should feminine products be more off putting than poop?
