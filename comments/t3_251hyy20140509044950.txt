Just one point on this - let's be realistic that outlawing abortion does not necessarily mean all those babies being born safely and healthily in hospital as your post suggests. It means women being force to commit crimes like ordering pills online, just so they get control of their own bodies. It means women having massive complications and bleeding out from their abortion while making the far-from-safe journey back from England before they get 'found out'. It means women with non-viable pregnancies being forced to carry those pregnancies to term knowing there will never be a 'baby' at the end. It means women dying from dodgy abortion pills or procedures. It means hospital staff scared to do *anything* for fear they could lose their license.
