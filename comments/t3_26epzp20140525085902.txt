I know it's a stereotype, but I associate feminists with man-hating women, who focus on women's rights and privileges rather than true gender equality (fair for both genders, not only women). I view them almost as extremists in their views. I associate them with being loud and obnoxious, trying to force every female to believe that the true feminist view on women is the right one, including thoughts on fashion, makeup and health. I'd definitely be less skeptical of someone who called themselves a humanist instead of feminist
