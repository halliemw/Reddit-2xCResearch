I think that works. It's similar to Fund Texas Women, but it's on a national/internation scale. Then we give the information to clinics in places where there are few clinics (ie: Texas and Louisiana) and/or have mandatory wait times. It centralizes the entire thing, as opposed to having one place here, another there, and not knowing where to go for help. We'd have to advertise some, just because there are women who might not call a clinic that's 200 miles away because it's that far and they can't get there, but a lot of that can be through doctors, OB/GYNs, clinics that can't do abortions, word of mouth, that kinda thing. I had no idea what a problem this was, or that some places offered services like this, so I think it's important to make sure it's known in the right places.

I'm not in IT or know anything about website developing beyond 2000's HTML, but I can help with any of the other stuff. I work weird hours, but other than my job, I have no life and helping women is basically what I want to do with my life, so I'm fully in.
