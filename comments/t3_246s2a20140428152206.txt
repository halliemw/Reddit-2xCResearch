I think you're forgetting that not every GUY is a black belt trained judo master either. Plenty of normal guys leave themselves open to various attacks ... even if it's just a good knee to the scrotum, giving her time to run. 

I would NEVER, EVER, EVER tell my daughter to just sit back and take it. She may NOT win over an attacker, but then again, she may.
