The tests most places are using today usually only detect high-risk strains because they are more dangerous. However, a negative test doesn't always mean no strain of HPV is present. There can still be a low-risk strain that rarely causes cancer but rarely doesn't mean never. Also, one partner is enough to get infected and unless you're glued to your boyfriend 24/7 I don't understand how you can be so sure he's never been with anybody else... Well, it's your health, your responsibility.
