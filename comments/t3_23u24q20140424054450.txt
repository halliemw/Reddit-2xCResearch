Hair removal creams, in my opinion, are just generally not great. They can remove hair but never fully from my experience. Plus, because it doesn't get the root (obviously) it grows back quick. I've found hair to grow back quicker with a removal cream than shaving actually.

At the moment I really don't remove my hair in that area, I just trim all over and shave the bikini line and any other bits to make everything look neat and even. I used to wax professionally but stopped because I couldn't really afford to keep going. Waxing was 100% the best way. It doesn't hurt professionally in my opinion (that was me removing everything) but my pain tolerance is high. I have (and do) also epilated down there. I use one that can go in the shower. This CAN be very painful. But, after I did it once or twice I got used to it and it's just not that painful anymore (I also epilate my underarms). After waxing and epilating so much the stubble from just shaving was a lot softer, but still gets to the point where it feels like sandpaper to the touch. It just didn't hurt/irritate me growing through.

I decided to just stop removing everything though because I've not seen myself with a bush in years. I actually prefer myself with it than without it as long as I keep it neat and trimmed.
