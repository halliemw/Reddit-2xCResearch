I think this is a great way to look at this issue and would agree that thin women are a more privileged group than fat women. However, sometimes fat women go beyond expression of their frustration because skinny women don't realize they are privileged--they say thin women are not real women, imply that men don't love skinny women, imply that skinny women have less interesting lives (like in this article), etc. I don't buy that it's just an expression of "they don't understand how easy they have it." In fact, I would argue that in the context of your idea about social hierarchies that what we're actually seeing is one marginalized group trying to demean and thus climb over another slightly less marginalized group within a social hierarchy.
