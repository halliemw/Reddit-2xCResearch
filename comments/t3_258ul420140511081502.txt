"Tri-City-Life" sounds like a "crisis pregnancy center" - basically a fake office for the forced-birth crowd.  They often advertise themselves as women's health clinics, and offer free pregnancy tests and other prenatal care in order to draw in women.  They do not offer abortions or birth control.  Instead, they spread misinformation like you saw in your class - some have even been known to dicker around with women who express a desire to abort until too much time has passed.  Gross, malevolent people.
