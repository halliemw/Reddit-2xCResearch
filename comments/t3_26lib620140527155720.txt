It was directly Tina on some occasions, and then me and my influence. I never touched my friend, but I did suggest some pretty messed up ways of playing with dolls. I was pretty much a really bad influence to her. I just don't know where to draw the line. Did I use her? I don't know. In some ways, she was an outlet. I just wonder if Tina was using the same thinking and lacked the self control I had. That's why I feel guilty. In some ways, I feel no better than her.
