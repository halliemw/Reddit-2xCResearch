Thank you for this perspective. Right now I am struggling to know what to do for my SO tomorrow. He just lost his mom about two weeks ago. I don't think he looks at the loss of his mom in the terms you described (yet?). 

I know that the "firsts" can be some of the most challenging times for people who have lost someone, like first Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthday, etc., without them. Since this is the first holiday AND first Mother's Day, I'm afraid the hurt will be compounded. Does anyone have any advice?
