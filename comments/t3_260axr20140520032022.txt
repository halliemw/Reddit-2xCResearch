I can feel your point. I have seen similar behavior in /r/worldnews all the time. But firstly I'd like to make it clear that I feel that India does have legitimate problems with women's rights and gender equality issues. The way I see it, India is currently in the midst of a massive turmoil which is bringing the spotlight on all the social issues that is currently holding them back in their path towards progress. But I'm sure that the Indians will face the problem head on and come up with constructive solutions, and when the dust settles they will emerge as a better and stronger nation.

Having said that I do see a lot of latent racism being directed towards India whenever there are posts highlighting the issues in India, especially on /r/worldnews. There is always a constructive way of highlighting the problem and suggesting solutions, the way that is followed in SRS related subs for example. And then you have derogatory, degrading and slanderous manner followed elsewhere that frankly reeks of neo colonialism and the white man's burden mentality. No one is stopping anyone from presenting the views and opinions in a constructive manner, but I don't see any point in gross generalization of a 1.2 billion strong nation in a tirade laced with thinly veiled racism and projecting the whole country as some barbaric backwaters deserving of unbridled scorn. Most of the people who engage is such discourse seem to take it for granted the immense efforts and struggles of the millions that came before us during the suffrage movement, civil rights movement and feminist movements. It is easy to deem a civilization as barbaric while it is engaging in its own reform movements, while we reap the benefits of the fights that were won by others who came before us. I doubt any of these commenters understand the immense struggles involved in the civil rights movement, anti-war movement, etc. and the struggles that India is going through right now.
