This subreddit was not created to educate men or to debate with men. It was not created for men to have "real two-way discussions" with feminists. That is not what I come here for. This is a supportive space for women. 

Go to /r/askwomen if you have questions- the women there have volunteered to answer questions and educate others. If you truly want to learn from twox, then take a listening role. Really try to listen and hear what we have to say without interjecting, disrupting, derailing, or speaking on behalf women in your own life. Again, this is a supportive community for women.

Also, people don't come off as misogynists by "not using sensitive/appropriate language." People come off as sexists because of the substantive views they espouse. This subreddit doesn't even use much gender theory terminology.
