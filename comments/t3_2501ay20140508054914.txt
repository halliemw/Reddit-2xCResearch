It's overkill as the first method to try. 

If you can't talk to the person you're in a relationship in without threatening to sue them over a possible mistake, then you're setting yourself up for a never ending life of disappointment and ruined relationships.

I'm not saying she shouldn't try this approach if he refuses again and shows himself to be everything people are claiming, but to automatically assume someone is that horrible after a single incident is simply sad. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just too optimistic to think people can settle things liked adults without resorting to legal maneuvers like this. But it doesn't seem like a healthy attitude to take in assuming you always have to be on the defensive and protect yourself legally before even knowing the full situation.
