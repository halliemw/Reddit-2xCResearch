As a Mother I'm sure she loved you more than anything!!! 4 months or an eternity it doesn't matter! The moment I laid eyes on my daughter I knew that I would love her more than anything imaginable. It's hard for people like us who lost their mother's on Mother's day, but nothing beats a Mother's love and you will always have that!!!
