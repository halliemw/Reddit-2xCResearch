I have been in countries and areas where pepper spray is illegal. Know what? I don't give a shit. I am going to take the steps I need to take to protect myself and feel safe. There is pretty much no reason for your spray to ever be discovered (unless you have to use it, in which case you can spray, cut and run). I know it's not so good to advocate you break the law, but in your position I would have a police-sized can of pepper spray clutched in my fist at all times.
