I'm 5'10", 150lbs, and all of my height is in my torso. I purposely avoid ordering clothes online because I have no idea how anything is going to fit me. 

I can't tell you how helpful it would be if every website had a chart like this.  Good stuff!

Edit: Now that I've read through the thread, holy crap, this is what *everyone* is saying about buying clothes online. I can't believe more retailers haven't tried to address the issue and increase their customer base!
