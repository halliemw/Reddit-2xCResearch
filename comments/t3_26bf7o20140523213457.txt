Oh man, I get so, so angry at the whole "hardware/DIY for women" thing. One time I was at Home Depot and they were advertising a Saturday class specifically for women, with shit like: how to hang a picture and how to unclog a drain. I wanted to burn down the whole fucking store. That is a class for *beginners*, not women. I am a woman, and I can fucking sweat copper pipe and plumb a bathroom from scratch: fuck your sexist drain unclogging class. Rage.
