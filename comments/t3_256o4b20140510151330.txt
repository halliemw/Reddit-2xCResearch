That's a good point, thank you. 

I still think it was really ridiculous for her doctor not to even give an exam or anything and still make that decision. Yeah, everybody is going to have a reaction to their bc but its not going to be the same reaction. If its something OP really wanted it the gyno shouldn't have just ignored it and not discussed options.
