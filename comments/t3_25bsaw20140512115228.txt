Absolutely. Depression can be a symptom of many things, and is not always a disease in and of itself. I have hypothyroidism. Some of my other symptoms are constant fatigue and feeling perpetually cold. At 14 I was put on antidepressants that never worked. After seven years of crippling depression and horrible side effects from various antidepressants, I quit the drugs cold turkey. Don't do this. I had a psychotic break and nearly ended my life. Then I nearly ruined my life. I alienated almost everyone I knew. I took the next three years and figured out how to just "manage." I was in survival mode, one major depressive episode from suicide. I got a full time job and new insurance, and at 24 I went to a dr for a well woman exam. She took some blood and ran some standard tests, including a thyroid panel. My thyroid was low. 

Within two hours of taking my first pill, I felt like I had been lifted from the bottom of a well. Suddenly I was not treading water for survival. I was standing on solid ground. I had energy, I was warm. I wanted to do things. Activities were enjoyable again, not just escapes from an unpleasant existence. I remember thinking "this is what normal people feel."

My brother is clinically depressed, and they tested his thyroid, before they put him on antidepressants. When I was diagnosed, they stuck me on the same meds as my brother without any physical tests, assuming it was genetic. I'm still angry that I spent a decade being depressed when one single blood test would have fixed everything.
