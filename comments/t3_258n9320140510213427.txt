If anyone is looking for a decently priced "vintage" style suit, I bought a couple on [Punkabilly Clothing](http://www.punkabillyclothing.com/), and I love them (mostly because they weren't $150)! Cherry Dollface (youtuber) did a video on them, and I think she has a 15% discount code you can use. [Here's the video she made - bonus, she's super awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LsgjZHzVO0).
