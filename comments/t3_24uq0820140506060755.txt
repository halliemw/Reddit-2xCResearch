You've got about a week every month when you're fertile. That's like a quarter of the time. Not to mention that your body knows when it's fertile and even if you don't want to make babies, your body does, so women tend to have a higher libido when they're fertile. That means you're more likely to have sex during that 20-25% of the time that you're fertile (assuming you aren't on hormonal birth control). And for women who have shorter cycles, like one of my friends who has a 21-22 day cycle, it's an even higher proportion of the time.
