One of the best things that you can do is to reassure her that it is not her fault. Nothing she did or is wearing or the way she walks is causing these people to do this to her. They are doing it because they are assholes, plain and simple. That'll give her more confidence in herself. 

On the flip side, I'd make sure she has a phone so she can easily call someone when she gets scared, and I second the idea of self defense classes. They're a very good idea for ANYONE, just in case.
