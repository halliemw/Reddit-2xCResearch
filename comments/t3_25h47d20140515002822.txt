Actually, that's exactly it. The only thing I would want changed is attitude and mindfulness. I don't see these things as unfair. I see them as an unfortunate but integral part of life. The same way it is unfortunate but integral that men cannot nurture life to be born. The only thing I wish is for people to be mindful of how it feels like to live as a woman, to empathise. I don't expect physical differences to disappear but I want the misconceptions based on them to do: victim blaming and slut shaming, excessive sexualization etc. Maybe people can think a second more before cracking a rape joke and reconsider. And entitlement. So much the entitlement some people feel for women to do certain things (take certain roles, give up their name, always accommodate men's advances, always be more submissive and polite than expected of a man).

And that is no utopia. I have seen the difference culture can make in attitudes. I always thought it would but by living it, it blew me away. So it can get a lot better.
