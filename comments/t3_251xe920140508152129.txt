A counselor now is better (and cheeper) than a lawyer later. I've been the guy in this situation where both of us had out of control anger, communication breakdown at a simple "good morning", and an inability to empathize. She made an appointment, and coerced (with an ultimatum) me into going. I'm very glad I did. 

What I didn't know was how nonjudgemental the environment would be. I didn't know that my needs weren't being met (hi, i'm a typical guy in the provider role who forgets that he's a person with needs too). I didn't know that my needs not being met contributed to her frustration in trying to communicate with me. She didn't know what my needs were, she was frustrated that she kept guessing wrong and I wouldn't tell her. We both learned to use "enforceable statements" - When you _(do a specific thing)_, I feel _(a feeling)_ and I'd like you to _(an action)_-, we both learned to stop framing every interaction either entirely emotionally or entirely non-emotionally and find the middle ground. 

I'm really glad she made the appointment, and I'm really glad I went. 

I hope you're not in as bad a place as we were, and I hope you don't need to use an ultimatum (they quite often backfire). It sounds like you've found a path forward for yourself, one I hope he joins you on. Your story is very close to mine, except i a guy and the timing (mine happened ~6mo after our daughter was born). Maybe something you can mention is that this behavior (anger, throwing, non-communication) is an entirely unacceptable environment in which to raise a child. It's trite and stupid, but none the less true; becoming parents changes everything.
