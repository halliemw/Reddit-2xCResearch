You cannot assert that in order for me to believe that SOME rights are universal, I must believe that ALL rights are universal.

It's true, I believe children have different rights from adults in some respects, and women have different rights from men in some respects.  This doesn't mean that I don't believe that some, heck *most*, rights are universal.
