I'm not looking forward to calling them again. The receptionist was nice but the nurse/doctor who took my question was very brusque and actually hung up on me the second he gave me an answer not even waiting to see if what he said answered my question.

It was just super dishearting to tell him all my symptoms (bipolarity and depression run in my family) and get such a generic-feeling diagnosis. Actually it wasn't even a diagnosis, he literally just gruffed, "mood swings" when I asked him what the medicine was for.
