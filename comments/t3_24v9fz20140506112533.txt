I LOVE THIS SHOW. Largely because of Tina.  It's so refreshing to see someone who represent(ed) me at that age--and even a little bit now--with all of the awkwardness, angst and the obsession with boys.  The family dynamics are sweet without being saccharine-- they clearly love each other but not without driving each other insane in the mean time.  The characters aren't styled to be sexualized, just sort of there.  The whole show is just perfect.
