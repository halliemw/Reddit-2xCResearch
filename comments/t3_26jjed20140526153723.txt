Please call the police, even though it has been a while, they may be able to take fingerprints (they will take yours to exclude them) or perhaps find evidence outside your window and there will be a police report.  
During the police interview you may remember more than you know, like the sound of the man's voice, was there an accent or even facial features.  The police may be looking for this person, as it is unlikely that your apartment is the first one he has broken into. 
Have your management company install window locks so that the window can only be opened a few inches to allow fresh air and as others have suggested, an alarm that will sound if the opened wider than those few inches.   
You may also want to consider a personal alarm system, I know these are typically sold to the elderly, "I've fallen and can't get up", but these are useful anyone. These are sold at a number of places, including Walmart, and the monthly fee is reasonable.  Some work on cellular and use GPS, so you can use it for emergency situations outside of your apartment and these connect directly to assistance. 
Good luck and I am sorry this happened to you.
