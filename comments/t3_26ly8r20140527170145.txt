I'm not hateful at all. 

> You're being narrow minded, focusing on trying to mitigate the results of a broken system, instead of trying to fix the system, just because it's easier for you in the moment.

Who says I'm not trying to do both? They're not mutually exclusive. I'm not throwing away my ability to protect myself just because there's an alternative path to pursue. 

> You're not recognizing that this can ALL be avoided.

By all means, please share with the rest of the class. How do we change mental health care to eliminate 100% of all violent crime?

> Moreover, do we really want to compare the right to life, against the right to 'not be raped'?

Yes. When someone chooses to commit a violent crime (note I say violent crime, not talking about petty crime here) against me, they surrender their right to life. I care more about my personal safety than I do about the personal safety of the person attacking me. End of story.
