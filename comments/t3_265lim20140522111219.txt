Your military history is irrelevant and frankly is lame to boast of your physical prowness on the internet. Especially in the context of discussing rape. Curtly, nobody cares. 

You saying if a guy has mild asperger syndrome and in his mind a girl signaled ok that even if the girl did not signal ok it is not rape. Nope sorry, social inadequacies do not excuse you raping someone. Misunderstandings are no excuse for breaking the law. If you have trouble understanding social cues you need to spend more effort than an average person in making sure those cues are read right. If that means being awkward and asking for verbal consejt than so be it. You do NOT  err on the side of raping a girl because you are fucking socially stupid. Amd no person that I know woth asperger syndrome would accept your crude example.
