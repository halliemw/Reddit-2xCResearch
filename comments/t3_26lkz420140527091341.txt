That's awesome!! Congrats on the job, it's a great one and very rewarding to be able to see what you've built with your own hands. 

I owned a landscape company for several years, and the most important things are good boots, hydration and energy. Invest in a quality set of footwear, probably steeltoe/shank -- you don't get a spare pair of feet when these ones get injured. Also invest in good work socks that wick moisture, (**EDIT:** not) 100% cotton. 

For hydration, pack lots of water. What I do is freeze half the bottle overnight and add half the bottle fresh in the morning, then wrap it in a kitchen towel to keep it cool. I also have these neck wraps that I got at a motorcycle shop that you soak in water and tie on. They swell with the water and help keep you cool. 

And finally, protein bars! Fresh fruit and veggies! You are about to be in what might be the best shape of your life, and you're going to get paid to do it. Help your body out by giving it good building blocks and you won't need to spend time in a gym if you don't want to. 

**EDIT:**my pre-caffeinated brain cannot translate thoughts to typing. You do NOT want 100% cotton socks. Thanks for the heads-up everyone, much appreciated!
