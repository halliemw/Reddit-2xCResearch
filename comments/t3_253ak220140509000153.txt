Have  you tried "walking strong"? I actually live in a bad section of town, and when I walk I just walk like I'm the biggest badass in town. Chin up, shoulders back, planting each foot firmly as I walk. Not looking around, just straight ahead. I tell yah, since I started doing that, I get left the fuck alone. If you're walking like your frightened, people will pick up on your body language, and the bad ones will mark you as an easy target. 

Watch old movies with manly men, like Humphry Bogart or old cowboy movies. Watch how those men walk. Emulate that. I promise it works.
