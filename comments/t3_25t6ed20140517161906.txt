Maybe you should say something to your dad, since he's the one making this such an awkward experience for you. When you two are alone you could just mention that you think it's pretty uncool that he's going to ditch his kids on a "family vacation" to hang out with his mistress. Don't dance around it. He *should* be uncomfortable during that conversation.

Especially because your sister really wants to spend time as a family, maybe you should go and just do sisterly things together! If your dad insists on bailing on her you can be there to say, "Hey let's ditch HIM and go shopping/to a movie/waterskiing/whateva". It sounds like you're a good sister. She's lucky someone is looking out for her.
