Oooh I can actually contribute to this. One of my very sheltered male friends had an irrational fear of the menstrual cycle. I thought it was just the typical "eeew you bleed out of your vagina" crap I have heard from a couple of immature dudes. Nope, turns out he thought that women were latent carriers of HIV, and having sex with women on their period  (regardless if they are HIV negative) will spread HIV. 


Literally had to sit down with my mate (20y.o at the time) and explain to him how periods work.
