I do think that my body is working against me. I live in Russia, where ob/gyns are incredibly reluctant to recommend an IUD to a nullipara. Thus, IUDs are out of the question. I'm on birth control pills, but sometimes those fail. I've already been raped before and it resulted in a pregnancy scare which might or might have not ended in a miscarriage. My body *is* working against me, because a pregnancy scare inevitably would result in a mental breakdown. An actual pregnancy would result in suicidal ideations. It's not "something so trivial as slightly different plans", it's something that my body does which can ruin my life.

Also, try to find a non-patriarchal man here. it's harder than finding a needle in a haystack, which is why I'm not dating locally. Please get off my case - your advice is well-meant but doesn't apply all that nicely to my current situation.
