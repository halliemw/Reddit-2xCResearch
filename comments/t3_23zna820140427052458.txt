Lets address three issues. First, the wording of question. Second, the "we're sick of hearing that stuff." And third, the actual issue of "is there any difference between the genders in innate maths ability?"

First. I worded it that way because the subtext of the whole post *is* that society often says "girls aren't good at math." So my question was based on a thought process along the same lines. I was really saying "hang on, haven't male brains actually been shown to be better at maths on average?" I do now apologise for the wording, as I see that the language I used may have included an "assumption as to the truth," but that *was* my assumption (given to me by society I guess). One that I am more than eagerly willing to change.

Second. "We're sick of hearing that stuff" isn't (in my opinion) a good reason to quash the discussion with someone genuinely looking to find out the truth. Everybody has bullshit thrown at them by society, and trying to shut people up when they open a conversation about that bullshit is really counter-intuitive.

Third. I went to google scholar, and found an absolute mess. Plenty of studies *do* show differences between the genders in all kinds of cognitive abilities, and the most common is males are better at systemizing/spatial tasks, females better at empathizing/language tasks. This is discussed as the default in most meta-studies. But there are also studies showing that these relationships are probably non-significant. Others highlight that males show much more variance, at both ends of the distribution. More say that it's probably all just a result of gender-roles being fulfilled. So, to conclude, I have no fucking clue what to think.
