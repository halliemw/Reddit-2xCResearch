I feel you because I have a very similar body shape, and this is why I like thongs. I know a lot of women hate them, but they're the only thing that's not uncomfortable. I wear briefs with jeans, but without some kind of tight fitting garment to hold the underwear in place, I invariably get a wedgie. I can't wear boy shorts with clothes for the most part. Even when I buy larger undies, they sag on my butt, but still aren't wide enough.
