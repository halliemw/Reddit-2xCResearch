Late to the party, but I have it too. It's not a big deal. My doc recommended a colposcopy, which is a procedure in which the doc uses a speculum to hold you open and swabs the surface of your cervix with vinegar. Any areas with abnormal cells will turn white (if you think about it, it's awesome that such a simple diagnostic tool exists). The doc then took a biopsy from the surface of my cervix (owie) and then a swab from the cervical canal (owie owie owie) and it was all over. My results were basically that I have abnormal cells but it's not cancer, and it's not a big deal. I have to go back for paps every 6 months until I have 3 normal ones in a row (hasn't happened yet but I've only had one since) and that's it! 

I also quit smoking since smoking is highly correlated to cervical cancer in women with HPV. 

I completely understand the shock, and the freaking out, because I went through both. But you're gonna be fine :) Good luck!
