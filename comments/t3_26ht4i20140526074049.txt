> Young men can be really dense about reading signals

Am young man, can confirm; sometimes being more open and straighforward is the best thing to do, because a guy with a crush could either don't understand a thing that isn't completely obvious (and by obvious i mean [this obvious](http://i.imgur.com/RdnJMht.jpg)) or overreact and become 300% more awkward than usual, especially if their experience in the matter is small or next to none.  
I agree with cebrek here, a man is definitely going to appreciate a girl that isn't too worried of speaking up for herself (i think that's the english expression i'm looking for), it makes it easier to have a good time together and tones down any tension and/or awkwardness, as long as the girl isn't being unnecessarily bitchy about it or the guy just wants a carpet and not a woman.

I'm a tad confused as why he would invite someone at a Q&A about sexuality and stuff, so i'm not entirely sure what was John thinking.. unless he was already going and thought "maybe she'd like to go as well?"... probably we'll never know for sure, but it doesn't matter anymore.

Still, OP, there's no need to cringe too hard about this, i'm just 21 and i've already had so much things i regret that sometimes I want to headbutt a wall for my own stupidity, so you're just a normal person in a weird weird world. :)  
Now live your life and just try to be a bit more decisive (again, i hope that's the right english term) when awkward encounters happen; as long as you aren't aggressive or derisive it'll make things easier for both.
