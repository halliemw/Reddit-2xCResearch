Nope. But after being in a relationship for an extended period of time, I tend to have nicknames for my girlfriend. My fair lady. Smudge. Baby. Hey you. Dear. Hun. When I said "My fair lady", I meant it as a reference to the female in my life that I consider to be the classiest and fairest lady of them all. I apologize for any confusion.
