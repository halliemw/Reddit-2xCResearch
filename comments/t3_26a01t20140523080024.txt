I was bullied at exactly that age. Culminated in a girl stabbing me in the hand with a maths compass.
Seriously, get your mum or dad to talk to the teacher. If there's a meeting let your little sister go along so she can tell her story. If it weren't for my mum doing that I'm not sure how I'd have coped. Good luck.
