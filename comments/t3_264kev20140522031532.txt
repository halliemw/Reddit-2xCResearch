I don't agree with you at all. If I'm in my place of work they don't care about me being ashamed of my body. They care about me looking professional if I'm dealing with clients. If I wear something lowcut because wearing high collar things makes my chest look bad and a client complains that I was dressed not professionally my company isn't going to care one bit about me being "shamed of my body". They're going to care that a client felt I wasn't dressing professionally and I could be fired over it. That's the real world I'm afraid. School uniforms teach you that certain codes of dress for certain environments are important.
