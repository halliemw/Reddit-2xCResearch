Believe me, it's not just tall people. I'm only 5ft 8, but I have a rather long torso (24 inches), wide shoulders (18 inches) and a large chest (48 inches), so I know the feeling way too well. My shape is clearly an upside down triangle, and to get the length I need to compensate, I have to wear a men's medium or large.
