That is the only action I can really condemn him for. Yes, if you feel you can't continue your relationship after something like this then that's your decision to make, but you have to support your partner through the process. Not taking her to and picking her up from her appointment is a dick move. Not that she might even want him there, but to leave her all alone like that... Immature and manipulative and not at all the action of someone ready to be a parent. Fucking man up.
