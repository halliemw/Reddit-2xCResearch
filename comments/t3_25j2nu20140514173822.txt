I upvoted, but my guess is that they would say that yes, almost every product and comfort of modern life in first-world nations is built on the back of slave/sweatshop labor by children and oppressed groups in the third world, if you didn't already know that you're an idiot, and focusing on a human-interest styled story about micah in makeup as though this is a stunning, outrageous revelation is disingenuous and annoying.
