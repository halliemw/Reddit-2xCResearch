I've used nappy disposal bags before, when I was at my dad's house and he had a newborn. Some stores also sell discreet disposal bags that are scented and opaque. I use [these](http://www.gelpack.com.au/INCOGNITO/HMTL%20pages/Incognito%20home.html). 

Aside from that, I'd recommend a menstrual cup if you're comfortable using one. No product disposal necessary, only wiping it out with water or sanitising spray.
