No worries, everything turned out for the best! Got that shit ultrasounded, pulled out, and a new one put in. I was so nervous that it would hurt that my gyno loaded me up on valium and life was good. It was definitely a freak accident, I was going pee at work and leaned over to pull my underwear up at the same time as a sneeze hit... most awkward position EVER and oh my god the cramping. Still, it makes fod a good story! :)
