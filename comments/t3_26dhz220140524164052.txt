Literally all we know about the conversation was what she said

> Their chat was full of sexually explicit things (sexual talk, telling each other how good the other one looked, all that fun shit).

Which is not cheating or out of line. You can tell someone they are good looking with no intention of cheating. Its not like they talked about sucking eachother off or did cybersex on a webcam. Is he not allowed to talk to other girls without her permission?

On the other hand, snooping and reading private messages IS out of line.
