The only absolute assurance is to, umm, go it alone. That's how I avoided kids, and I only have to shave my palms once a week. 

But in reality, all legally marketable (in the US) contraceptives have ridiculously low chances of failure, when used properly. Add that to the pull out method, which, while not as fun, is about as effective as condoms.  It's all about which one is most convenient for you. 

Probably the best thing you can do for peace of mind is figure out what you'll do in that "what-if" moment. Discuss it with him, of course. And when you guys have a comfortable solution, you'll find it isn't as much of a concern.
