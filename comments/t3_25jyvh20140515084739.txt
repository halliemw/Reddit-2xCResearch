Seen a doctor - medically, there ain't much to say that would play into this. Mental help is out of the question right now - it's costly and we're already short on money here. And as far as I can tell I was never really abused - it's just bottled up stuff that probably stems from always needing to be the resting pillar of people around me - the one who they can stop at to catch a breath to go on, without mentioning the fact that people expect me to be stoic anyways.
