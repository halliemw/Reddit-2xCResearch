I sometimes get a really sharp pain there when I ovulate. It's bad but doesn't last long. Sometimes, it'll happen a couple of times.

However, lower right pain can be an indicator of something serious like appendicitis. I'm assuming the doctor checked for that? They often press on the area and then release. With appendicitis, the pain is intense during the release. I'm not a doctor, so that's not medical advice. I scheduled stuff like CT scans at a GI doctor's office, though. Whenever they were in doubt about someone possibly having appendicitis, I needed to get people in for a scan ASAP, even if it meant sending them to the emergency room.
