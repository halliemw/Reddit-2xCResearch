XY here.  Yeah, I agree, often the male attitude is still entrenched in the past.  I studied mech. engineering.  In my grad class there were 80 of us in total; 77 of them men.  Even if all 77  were perfect modern respectful men (which they were not), I bet it would have felt pretty awkward to be that one girl in the class.

There were a variety of other complications too.  For example, the university understandably wanted to get more girls enrolled in the program, so they implemented a double standard for GPA admission requirements in the mech. program, making it easier for women.  Fair enough, but you can see how it might have brewed some resentment.

On the upside, in my career I work with a lot more female engineers than I encountered during my education. The profession is still overwhelmingly dominated by men - but there are a lot *old* men making up a huge portion that will be retiring soon.  I really do think things are improving.  I feel like it's an issue that might just take a generation or two to resolve as gender-specific expectations for younger generations continue to fall away.
