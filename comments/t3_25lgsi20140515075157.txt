I've been  long-distance for pretty much the entirety of my current (and so far first!) relationship. I met him while he was at uni (relatively) near where my parents lived, then I moved to uni (relatively) close to where his parents lived, so term-time we were at opposite ends of the country and holidays we switched. That was fun... He's now in the army, so it's considered a good month if I see him for more than one weekend (his camp's only about 2 hours away, but I work/study and he sometimes gets weekend duties).

I hate how everything you read about LDRs is about how they fail, it's nice to see everyone here having success with them.
