Ebay doesn't allow the selling of used underwear (because of pantyselling concerns) and I don't really find nice stuff when thrifting so admittedly I just buy new underwear. Packs of hanes/fruit of the loom can be cuter and cheaper than you expect, (maybe a dollar to two dollars a pair if you get a good deal) and you get a guarantee of no stains or weirdness. Especially since cotton breathable underwear is healthiest and most practical anyways, if you can get what you need cheap, there's no reason to mess with used.

Used bras though are worth the splurge because they hold up well, people take care of them better, it's great to find something that's usually fifty dollars or so for only 10 dollars including shipping. And honestly I was hesitant about buying used bras until I sold some used bras, realized I wore used clothing of all other varieties, and even when I told my mom she expressed mild concern. Maybe used underwear isn't much worse, not really sure you'd catch an STD or a disease from it or anything like that, but since most people can buy it so cheap it's not worth the effort.
