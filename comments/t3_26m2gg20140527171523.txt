I decided a long time ago that I don't particularly like the person that my mum is. I love her and appreciate some of what she's done for me, but it mostly feel that I've displayed all of the appreciation I need to and no longer feel the need to engage her in any way. It has still been a long, slow and often times painful unravelling of emotional baggage that is leftover from dealing with someone as manipulative as she is. I'm in counselling (for, like, the 189th time - not because it doesn't work, but because shit happens and I'm constantly forced to deal with shit from a different angle on the regular) and it helps tremendously.
