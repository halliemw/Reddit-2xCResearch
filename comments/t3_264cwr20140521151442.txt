Are guys allowed to post? im not sure how that works.

I have a friend like this. He and I are close because he's the only person I've been friends with since Pre-K. This guy, call him....Jesse?, is quite a dick. He harasses people through sarcasm so he can call it a joke. He takes shots at other people to feel better about himself and is as brutally honest with people as he can be. His gf and him used to settle problems the way you've been and by making trade-offs like "if u can sext ur ex, i get to watch porn nightly" it led to a lot of sidestepped pain. Eventually, I think they discovered you can't spend your life living unsettled compromises, and the need to keep together through everything wasn't worth the pain. I think his ex is much happier now with a guy who doesn't treat her that way. I think he's much better with a girl who, like me, gets what the jokes are and how to take them.

If you aren't seeing eye to eye, I would expect it to get worse, not better. People change, I've seen it happen, but usually only when they've lost something substantial.
