Thank you for sharing. "Exploring" your sexuality by using young girls is NEVER okay and you were taken advantage of. You're right in that this is a "fuzzy" area, how do we combat this? We are already struggling to get rape/abuse victims to speak up against their male abuser, I can imagine a young female abuser is taken much less seriously by authorities. Support from me, sister.
