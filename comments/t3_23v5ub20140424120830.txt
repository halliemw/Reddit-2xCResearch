as far as making new female friends goes, i would suggest volunteering with something you are passionate about. it's a good way to meet people, and if you're thinking about applying to grad school, it's a good resume booster. and moving in with your parents may feel really hopeless, but they are a built in support system. and believe me, i've been there, after you've gotten back on your feet some, you'll be doing everything you can to move out again.
