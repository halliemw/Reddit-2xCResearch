Thank you so much for sharing your experience - it's very reassuring to hear that it's possible to have an exciting sex life, even after 25 years! And that sounds like great advice - I'm glad it works for you, and I'll make sure to try it out and see if it works for us as well.

That's a good idea, I think I will share all these responses with him as well :)
