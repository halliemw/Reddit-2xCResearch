> Do I just avoid friendships with guys?

As a guy with mostly female friends, I don't think that's the solution. Of course there will be male friends falling in love with you. It's only natural, I mean, who wouldn't want to have his/her best friend as his/her SO. I'd just say: make it clear what your intentions are. If he (or even she) can't respect that, break it off.

> is it ever a good idea to try and maintain a friendship with someone when you know they're attracted to you/ want something more?

Well, that's a tricky one. I myself have been in love with one of my best friends without making any move at all (I was just getting used to the concept of "friends", I had no idea what so ever how to initiate it, much rather what it means to be in a relationship with someone. In retrospect, I also may or may not have missed a lot of hints she made that she wants more). I was fine with it and think I made a good job in not letting it get awkward. But in the end, as long as you are fine with it, I think it's the decision of the one in the "friendzone" . If he can be just your friend and be ok with it, you can totally keep it up as long as you dont take advantage of it. Just try to treat him like a friend and it should be ok.
