I'm working my first full time office job after a year now, and what I've learned is that many women in this environment can be incredibly envious/jealous/mean-spirited toward each other.  They all do this behind their backs, of course.  I know a girl here who literally looks down on and speaks poorly of any other woman that appears more beautiful than she.  I would mention my former boss, an extremely attractive young Cuban woman of about 30, in passing and she would say, "Oh my god I hate her so much.  She's such a bitch."  This former boss worked on the completely opposite side of the building, never interacted with this girl's department at any point of the day, and vice versa.  I couldn't figure it out.  She started saying the same shit about my boss's right hand, also a woman.  She's loud and funny, and speaks her mind.  The insecure one harps on this woman, too.  Again, they don't work anywhere near each other.  I've seen friendships fall out over petty shit like this, all from working in the general vicinity of people in an office.  You cannot accurately base the intricacies of true friendship on the phenomenon manifested in office relationships and the gossip that spawns from them.  It's so mind-shattering to a regular dude who keeps to himself, i.e. myself.  Just put out positivity and efficiency in your workday.  If people refuse to return it to you, that's on them.  If it's affecting your performance and sense of well-being, bring it up with an HR representative or look for a new place of employment.
