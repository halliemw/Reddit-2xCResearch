I'm glad! Trust me, I just moved to New York and there are billions of people here, but my first few months I felt so lonely. I literally was ok with my human interaction being sitting next to someone on the subway. It was really bad.


Not being super outgoing does make it difficult. Just make sure that the person you're interacting with can understand that you're still engaged in the conversation, or else they will perceive the convo as one-sided and tend to pull back. If you find yourself not having anything to say, whip out a filler phrase like "I'm just thinking..." or just ask the person to explain what they mean. Then they get to talk more and have someone listen (which people love), and you give yourself more time to make up a response.
