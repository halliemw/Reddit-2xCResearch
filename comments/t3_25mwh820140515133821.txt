I was at a bar once walking down the hall to the bathroom and some drunk guy pushed me against the wall by my stomach. Banged my head against the wall. He managed to blurt out "sup baby" or something and i put my finger in his face and said sternly "do not put your hands on me." He backed off and let out a slurred "WELL FUCK YOU THEN."

Guys are fucking assholes sometimes. For real. Try not to let it get you down.
