I actually kinda like this trend. I've always been fond of short hair and I think it looks really good on a lot of people... but I also know it would look really out-of-place on my long, square face. It'd look like I outgrew my hair.

For the same reason, I can't wear kapris on my stilt-legs. [Thank fuck that went out of fashion a while ago, though.](http://i.imgur.com/9zRqeIn.gif)
