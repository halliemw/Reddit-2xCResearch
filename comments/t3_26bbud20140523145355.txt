Yes, go get a rape kit. If it turns out nothing happened, great. But you have to have the rape kit done within a rather small window. You are far better off having done it just in case than finding out later you needed to have had it done in order to press charges or something. (I'm not saying you'll need to or want to, but you probably want to be prepared just in case.)
