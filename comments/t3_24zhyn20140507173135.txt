Good point about being too early. I am just second guessing about a lot of things now that are black/white decisions like from example making fun of people. Like right now on the table baby baptism. I am not religious but I grew up religious. I personally don't think its necessary and all but now that she's here my wife's faith has come out of the wood work and I'm sure i'll be going to church here now... just a lot of things like that. 

I wonder if there's future decisions like baptism that are much the same but much more for women. Quincea√±era's, Dances, etc.
