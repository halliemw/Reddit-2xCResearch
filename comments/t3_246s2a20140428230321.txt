The show doesn't promote violence but it does promote [Mean World Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_world_syndrome). The idea that the world is fundamentally a cruel and untrustworthy place and the only acceptable response is cynicism and apathy.

Its what bothers me about Game of Thrones. That the cruelty and violence in the show has gotten so egregious that it ceases to be  psychologically realistic. No one in the show has a moral compass and the sexual violence is only one facet of that. It leaves the audience desensitized and nihilistic. Which means the longwinded speeches of 'duty' and 'honor' or the complex explorations of themes and ideas are basically so much hot air. The show sticks a frog in a blender and expects us to root for the frog.
