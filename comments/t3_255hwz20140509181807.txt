My favourite memories of her include being general shit disturbers in highschool. We were really into the paranormal at that age and when we had a few hours to kill at night we would drive to the cemetary she would eventually be buried in to try and scare eachother or tell ghost stories. Another one would of been seeing the tragically hip with her canada day 2012. That was right near the beginning of her downfall... ugh too many memories to count. Very special person. Thanks for giving me the oppurtunity to reminice!
