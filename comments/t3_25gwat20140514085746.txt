The simple thing here that it is rape, a clear one (Depends of course how the laws in your country work, in my own country rape w/o violence is called sexual abusation and is much relatively lesser crime). The excuse about he thinking you were someone else is just first thing to pop into his drunken mind when he understands he has royally fucked up.

The difficult thing in here is how you actually tell this to your best friend and move forward with this, symphaties and courage for you for what awaits you beyond this thread.

I'm sorry but I must add I came like a volcano reading this story.
