Come on over to /r/c25k. It's a really great support system for the program. My fiancee and I just finished week 4, and it's been great to have somewhere to chat about it. If you can walk a half now, you're probably ahead of the curve for a beginner.  Also, I definitely recommend warrior dash. Did it 2 yrs ago, and it was *so* much fun. Congrats on your accomplishment and keep up the good work!
