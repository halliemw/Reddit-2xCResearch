Heya, I went through something similar! I found a lump in my breast when I was 15 and got it checked out. The ultrasound showed it was nothing to be worried about, but all that poking/prodding/pushing with the wand certainly did leave me bruised. 

A few years later the lump had grown twice as big and I got it checked out again. This time an ultrasound and a biopsy -  ugh. The lump was right under the nipple too, talk about sensitive area. The result was inconclusive and because it had grown a bit they wanted to remove it. It turned it to be nothing, just a fibroadenoma. I believe women who are using the pill are more susceptible to lumps (don't quote me on that though). 

If you're concerned, ask for a biopsy. They'll take a sample of it and get it tested. If you're young, odds are in your favor. Having experienced this exact same thing, I understand that you're worried. Keep an eye on the lump, talk with your doctor again and seek out the result that eases your mind.
