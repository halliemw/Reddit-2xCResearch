I don't really understand, but you sound a little offended. First of all, I have been hairy for 20 years and love my body and so do guys. Its never been an issue for me. But in my reading of other women's experience, I have had my innocence broken - women feel bad about their body hair. It seems like this shame is enforced by other women more than guys. It is heartbreaking to me that they have such a hard time. I know I have good feelings about myself because my mom was super body positive and I have never had TV or bought a women's magazine that shames women. So I am doing this because I want to help. I want to give the gift that I was given, self love. I don't really understand what opinion you think I want validated, or why you think I am indignant. I am confused.
