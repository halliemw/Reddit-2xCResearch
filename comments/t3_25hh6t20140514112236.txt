I don't know where else anyone can go (I'm new here), but this thread has cheered me up immensely.  Thanks, everyone.  This thread has enlightened me as to the original purpose of TwoX (which isn't far off from what I thought - I just made the mistake of thinking I too could express my opinions).  

Thanks, unforgivablecursive, for the referral to the other subreddit.  I have a lot to learn.
