I've been there. I met a guy online, talked for months, we exchanged pictures and even skyped. He flew 1500 miles to visit me for a week and from the minute he saw me I knew he was disappointed though he never verbalized it. I guess lucky for me he didn't lead me on during his visit, but his coldness definitely made for a difficult week. At some point during the week I got upset enough to confront him about his attitude, he made it seem as though 1. nothing was wrong and 2. we had different opinions about what our relationship was. To him we were just friends. -_- Considering he asked me for commitment and talked about bringing me home to me his parents, I doubt we were "just friends" in his mind before he saw me. 

It hurt. A lot. For so many reasons that are difficult to share. But eventually I got over it - learned that my value isn't defined by others and sometimes people suck.
