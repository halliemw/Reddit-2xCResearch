A male perspective on the issue, not to belittle your experience, but to give a possible explanation for why men seldom give up their career to follow a woman in such situations.

Some men enjoy dating driven, focused women while in school and starting their careers; but choose to settle down with women of lesser drive and career plans to make sure that they will be able to have kids on a schedule that appeals to them.

I think it may be because while women can choose to focus on a career while delaying having kids, men do not get that choice; for men having kids is not a choice or right, it's an earned privilege.

If a man dates women that have his (or greater) earning potential or career commitment he has a lower probability of having children; or at least having children while young enough to enjoy raising them (there is a big difference between having kids at 30 vs 40).

Once he has his career established changing his dating focus to women that are more interested in being a stay at home mom than having a career is a reproductive advantage.
