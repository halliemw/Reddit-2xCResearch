Very brave and inspiring knowing that you got justice. The system was slow but it didn't fail you. This is big and probably felt like it was never going to happen. Now, I want you to take a deep breath, get some ice cream, and smile a sincere smile. Know you did well. You may crash in a few days from all the adrenaline and sudden bricks off your shoulders. It's ok. Come here or talk to someone you trust. The aftermath crash is normal. Just your body and mind releasing so much. Allow yourself some time to go through the range of emotions. So very proud of you sister!
