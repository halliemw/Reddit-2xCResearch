I mean, we're doing our best to respond to you here in this thread. We responded to you and many others users here and elsewhere.

None our comments are coordinated, we each just speak from our hearts. We trust each other enough that we don't need any "official lines" at all. I'm sorry if you feel we're dodging stuff, but I promise you it's not intentional.
