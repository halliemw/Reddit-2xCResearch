I wasn't abused but am a very private person.  My husband has been my only partner and I haven't been able to make my self see a dr since we married 15 years ago and multiple children.  I do have a midwife friend who does non pelvic exam prenatal stuff if I need anything, mostly I do my own.  My husband was my birth attendant.   

It all stems for a miscarriage at 19 where I was treated horribly in the hospital.  I feel sick at the thought of a pelvic exam.  Also my mother shunned drs and made comments about women who go being exhabitionists and wanting the drs to look at their junk.  That had to have an effect .

I think if you have something you know is not right make yourself go.  If you are healthy, well, it's your body do as you please.
