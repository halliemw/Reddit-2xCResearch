I do plan on doing some strength training to get back some of what I've lost as far as strength.  I work a desk job and have always had pretty "nerdy" hobbies, so doing some physical training will help a lot I think.  The fact that I generally do nothing at all in that area almost certainly accelerated the process of strength loss.
