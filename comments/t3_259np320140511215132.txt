I don't agree with the "survivor" thing either necessarily, as it is still letting it define you.  I think I missed the point about the dream being the instigating factor in this, so I can see why it has been brought into sharp focus.

>If I'm being honest, he had truly convinced me that I was a bad girlfriend. He used to tell me that I was a really rude, inconsiderate person all the time and I had never really seen how unhealthy the way he treated me was until this recent experience starting with the nightmare. I have a lot of problems with blaming myself for guys sexually harassing me because I may sometimes dance/dress/act sexy but I need to learn to stop doing that.

This to me is the problem.  He was emotionally abusive.  A lot of people get into these relationships, as they start off much differently.  But that means HE was a bad person and you responded as best as you could to an irrational situation.  Wallow in self-pity if you need for a bit, but remember to not give him the power to affect your life from now on more than needed.

Know that all of this was because he was unhealthy and he dragged you in.  Take time to think of any red flags in future boyfriends that you may be able to recognize now.  You are older and wiser.  Girls go through a lot of "end of innocence" when they grow up, often experiencing the bad parts of bad people.  

I want to make clear that in no way am I trying to minimize any part of your experience.  I have just seen a lot in the difference of how perception can change a personal reality.

Two books I love as the protagonist goes through shit and doesn't let it touch her core:  Little Bee and Jane Eyre.  

The real you is untouchable.
