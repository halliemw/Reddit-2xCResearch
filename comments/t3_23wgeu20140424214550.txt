OP's question was, "Is this a thing?" and whether she should mistrust her reaction. I was just noting that it is "a thing" and that her instincts may well be good. I don't think trying to love someone into a new identity is ever a good plan for anyone. And for someone who wants to be a caretaker, succeeding could end his or her attraction.    
  
If this guy gets extra aroused by the notion that she's broken, and she doesn't feel like that's a fair or adequate portrait of herself, then she's stuck feeling disconnected from whatever it is he thinks he loves. Also, neither of the qualities you mention as possible fetishes are likely to make a person to whom they are attributed feel diminished or disrespected. She mentioned that she thinks of herself as pretty cool and rebuilt despite being "damaged," so that this description was dismaying.  
  
Anyway, those were the points I to which I was responding. Maybe there's a ratio between significance of a fetish as a cause for attraction versus degree of independent attraction to a whole person that different people mind or accept in different measures. But if your partner's into an idea of you that you actively reject, it can be disturbing. You just don't want to be with anyone who can't reply with an unqualified yes to the question, "Would you still love me if I felt better?"
