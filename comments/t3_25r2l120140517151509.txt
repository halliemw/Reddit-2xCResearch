There are always one or two women with this style in my (male-dominated) workplace as well.  And right now there's an upper manager who has a bit of this style, but she avoids the gross-out factor and sticks scrupulously to sports, beer, and facts about bourbon and whiskey.  I have to say I admire her sports knowledge (again, I've known lots of women who spend the time to do this) but I just can't do the sports thing.

The women who have this kind of boyish relationship with the boys spend more time with the boys, and less with the other women (the clerical side of the workplace is of course mostly women - I can do either, but I skip out on the gross jokes and sports talk; while every one knows they can get me to join in a conversation about children and childrearing - something the "boy side" never discusses; they discuss on rare occasions something their son or daughter has accomplished, but I've seen genuine alarm on their faces if I try to steer the conversation towards children - the way I tend naturally to do with others).

In one area of my workplace that is about 50/50 men/women, I notice some of the men readily talk about their children (they are not WASP-American men, though - those are the ones who seem most reluctant to talk family/children).
