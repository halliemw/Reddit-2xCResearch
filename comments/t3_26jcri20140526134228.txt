Honestly, I shop all sale items. Urban Outfitters has a 50% off all their sale items in store, and so does Pacsun online. I never shop there, but just yesterday bought four bottoms (two skirts, one pair of shorts, and cigarette pants) for $34. 

You can google search "such and such store promo code" and usually most online retailers will have something around 15% off your basket order. Anthropologie and Free People have some really great sale items randomly less than $50, and you can get a 15% your order on your birthday. 

I'd recommend checking out UO's sale items. I've gotten great heels for $8 and shirts/shorts/dress less than $20. On the surface it's like the hobo designer for college hipsters, but some of it is nice. I wouldn't order anything polyester as it's cheap, doesn't machine wash, and wrinkles easily. ASOS and UO are notorious for cheap polyester blended dresses masked as nice summer dresses, from my experience.

Other nice stores are www.shopruche.com , www.chicwish.com, www.spottedmoth.com.

SERIOUSLY be diligent to looking at a retailer's sales items. I hardly ever  ever buy clothes full price and even though it will require countless acts of scrolling, you can find some really nice stuff at stores you'd either suspect is too expensive or not your style.
