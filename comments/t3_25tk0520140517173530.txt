> If you are pregnant, the amount of pregnancy hormone (hCG) in your urine increases with time. So, the earlier after a missed period you take the test, the harder it is to spot the hCG. Many home pregnancy tests (HPTs) claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always detect the low levels of hCG usually present this early in pregnancy. And when they do, the results are often very faint.

> Most HPTs can accurately detect pregnancy one week after a missed period. Also, testing your urine first thing in the morning may boost the accuracy.

**TL;DR At least one week after your missed period, and in the morning for best results.**
