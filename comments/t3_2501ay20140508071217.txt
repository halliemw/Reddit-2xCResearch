I understand that's what most people are fearing will happen and there won't be a second chance to talk or do anything. 

But doesn't it sound like that sort of move might even increase those odds of it happening, compared to simply talking? Especially if she goes in with a defensive or antagonistic attitude where he could become suspicious and find out. Maybe he gets angry or she does and even threatens him not to post them online.

Maybe it works out, but nothing good comes from him posting any pictures online, even if she gets evidence of their conversation and sues him later on.

I would rather risk trying to convince the other person to see my point of view in a calm and sincere manner at first, instead of concentrating on gathering evidence and possibly antagonizing the other person.

If on the off chance that he does turn out to be a complete creep and there isn't ever a chance to talk again, then there are still other legal avenues to take. She's not doomed to fail if she tries talking first and it might be less of a risk of her pictures being posted.
