If you emotionally can't handle an abortion, you won't handle pregnancy, delivery and being a mother. A child as a single mom in the wrong time can and will fuck your life up - sometimes forever.

What your ex does is fucked up, although I see his intentions - no excuses though. Take a few days to relax and think about this, block him on your phone, talk to someone with PP - at least to get it off your chest.
