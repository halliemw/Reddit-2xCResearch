Yes same exact thing here, bf has a vasectomy and it seemed to get stronger in the last few years. My bf also doesn't seem to be bothered by it either but I am. I wonder if we are just getting better at smelling it or are hung up on it so it seems stronger because that is the weirdest part to me that it seems to have gotten stronger over the years.
