This is tricky.  Student conduct codes vary, but where I work, it's pretty strict and includes "disruptive behavior," "bullying," and goes from "persistently defiant of authority" to "murder, rape and mayhem."  Any of those things can get a student kicked out or face other disciplinary action.  

You can bet that our behavioral intervention team takes students out of classrooms all the time for inappropriate behavior that is far less serious than any crime, but I think it helps make the whole campus safer.  

Getting the person completely off campus requires either a serious infraction or repeated infractions (but the standard of evidence used is much less than in a court).  Student has all kinds of appeal rights, but they don't usually appeal - if they did, it would go all the way to the Board of Regents.
