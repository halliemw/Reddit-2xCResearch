You can also put [a small dowel rod above the window](http://www.ehow.com/how_5712179_stop-house-windows-being-opened.html) in the sill (for a window that opens upward) or to the side (for a patio door or a window that opens sideways) to keep the window from opening more than a few inches. Good luck and stay safe.
