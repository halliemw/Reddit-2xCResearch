I feel for you. I worked for a small family biz. Put in my hours plus more. Worked hard. Came in on my time off. And then was replaced by a friend of my boss. It was soul crushing - I know how badly it sucks and how you feel.  However, what I learned is that I'll never again put my whole life into my job. A job is just a job.  Apply for unemployment, and don't look back because they sure aren't - business is business and all that wonderful garbage.  I'm sure you'll land on your feet, hopefully in a healthier work environment :)
