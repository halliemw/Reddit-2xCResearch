I'm really not a big social person either... so I was rather confused as to why I've been so upset.  As I said, logically I know that prom isn't that big of a deal. I don't even like dancing. Honestly, in-home video game date sounds awesome. Maybe that's what we can do to make up for not going to prom, like y'all did :) 

But yeah, as far as the other girl situation I didn't even know he was still going with her until his dad made a joke about how I was mad ._.  It's not that big of a deal to me anymore. Thanks for the reply!
