OK. This may not work with everyone, but working out... Specifically developing a passion for running (but could be swimming, biking, whatever) has increased my self confidence tremendously. Especially training for and completing a race. 

Really I think any hobby could help too. I'm having the same trouble and I live near my mother (she's divorced but overweight and depressed). I feel like you can coax a spark but it has to come from within. If she's set against it, it won't happen.
