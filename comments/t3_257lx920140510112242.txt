Honestly, I spent some time lurking the Livejournal [Menstrual Cup](http://menstrual-cups.livejournal.com/) community, and read more than a person should about, well, everything. Then I went a bought two from a seller on their [sales community](http://mc-sales.livejournal.com/). The ladies there are really great, though your experience may vary.

*edit:* I should mention that I too have heavy periods, and the reason I bought mine was a combination of lack-of-tampon availability (yay Asia!) and being a pad-destroyer. My buttcrack might be a dog, the way it tears apart pads.
