Any advice, parent to parent?  My daughter developed scoliosis in middle school, was required to wear a back brace to prevent further curvature, and as a result her self esteem plummeted going into High School.  She's been battling all of the issues you've mentioned (depression, friendless, bullied).  She's been seeing a therapist, taking medications, and she was doing really well for a while but she has recently slipped.  She met a guy and now that is the center of her world.  I don't know what to do to keep her focused.
