Yeah, ever since I was in my early teens and spending time with a family with a lot of mental and neurological "issues", and having people armchair-diagnosing me with just about everything, I've gotten really good at picking up on the problems with self-diagnosis and "pick of the list of traits that you think fit you".  

It can be like astrology, where you can shuffle up people's horoscopes and they can always find _something_ to relate to, especially if they're desperate to relate to _anything_.

It's nearly impossible to untangle the roots of whatever is going on with my brain. What's because of my atypical childhood and parenting, and what things about the way my mom raised me was because I was already "weird"? What of my weirdness is neurological vs neurochemical vs. just behaviorally reinforced?

Tl;Dr do not be hasty to jump to conclusions, but if you feel some descriptor or diagnosis fits you well, perhaps seek additional perspectives
