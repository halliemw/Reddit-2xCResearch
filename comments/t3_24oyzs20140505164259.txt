Aww I want Korean-style Chinese now D: And naw, he never did, he's a retired doctor now. And since I just got married, he's expecting kids from us so now he's brushing up on like 6 different languages to teach them while they're still babies. :D

I'm convinced it's the facial look too. I have natural eyelid creases and deeper-set eyes, and a bigger face than, say, Japanese women tend to have. Might be my dad's partial Chinese background since my mother's side is straight up Korean all the way. (But hmm, I think she's how I got the eyelid folds.)
