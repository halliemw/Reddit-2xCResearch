Imagine being part of a group that people said was innately worse at something to provide evidence for belittling that group (your group). Further imagine hearing stuff like that occasionally for your whole life. That's the experience of many girls regarding "male brains are better at X"-type comments, but particularly when X is math, engineering, logic, etc.

You're getting downvoted because we're so sick of hearing that stuff; the notion is innately sexist, so we don't want people to keep spouting it, no matter how well-intentioned. I appreciate that you're interested in more information, for sure. Positing that male brains are better in your question is not the best way to do so, though, and I think that makes the difference between frustration and genuine answers. There's a big difference between

>aren't male brains better at maths on average?

and 

>is there any difference between the genders in innate maths ability?

The latter is an unbiased question because it doesn't include an assumption as to the truth. Keeping questions unbiased helps facilitate discussion and information sharing, if that's what you're interested in. Obviously, if you want to put forth an opinion, bias is fine.

If you still want more information now, I suggest Google scholar, as it's a good resource to find interesting research. There's lots of papers related to mathematical ability and its relation to gender.
