Just because I didn't actually specify in my original post, I feel I should probably mention that not only did he know I was on the pills, but I showed him the section of the leaflet that said I may do stuff in my sleep - we even laughed about it because it wasn't something we thought would actually happen to me.  I dunno if that context is important or not, but there you go anyway.
