This is late because I debated with myself for a while on whether or not I want to post this. I decided, hey, maybe a warning story about the dangers of associating with anti-choice crazies? (There's going to be some cursing, just FYI.)

I was raped when I was fourteen by a friend's thirty-three-year-old cousin who roofied my soda (I'm fine, I'm as over it as a person can be), and missed a few periods with my head firmly stuck in that river in Egypt. Finally, my mother noticed that I was eating these cookies that I hated constantly, which were the same cookies she craved when she was pregnant with me and my brother (runs in the family, I guess?) and bought three differently kinds of pregnancy tests (one of which came back negative, for some reason). After getting checked out by a doctor, who asked me what I wanted to do, I said that I wanted the little dick-turd out of me (come on, the dick-turd was half the man I hate more than any other except one).

I told some of my closest friends about it, wanting their support, but one of them was very anti-choice (because let's face it, they're not really pro-life if they don't give a shit about the mother's life) and made my life a living hell whenever we were in a hundred miles of each other. As I waited in the parking lot for my ride to the hospital the day of my abortion appointment, she came up behind me and stabbed me in the back of the neck with art scissors, telling me that she was going to kill me the way I wanted to kill my "baby" (because if I die, the dick-turd totally survives, right). School security officers pulled her off and the last time I heard, she was being treated as an outpatient at a mental hospital. I had a miscarriage from the stress of being stabbed (not that I remember it much, I hit my head on the pavement hard enough to knock myself out). And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I absolutely despise all anti-choicers upon identification.
