Teenagers deserve privacy from parents, especially in  health care.  Many parents would interject on the kids behalf while the doctor is trying to have a conversation with the kid and becomes completely disruptive for the doctor.    Some parents would be appalled to learn their kid is having sex at 15 or 16 y/o and forbid them birth control, which obviously makes no sense.  But in their minds it's wrong and you shouldn't do it so BC is just telling them it's okay.  Which it's not, obviously, but it's hard for parents to realize that their teens are sexual beings.   Plus, it gives the doctor a chance to question the kid about abuse and what not.  Anyway, I'm rambling.   
I'm glad you had a positive experience at the doctor's office!   One thing I tell my kids is to always tell the doctor the whole truth about your health.  Drugs, sex, weird things that show up on your body and any questions, even if they're embarrassing.  The doctors have heard everything under the sun and nothing you tell them will be shocking.  They're there to help you and if you don't tell all, they can't help you properly.
