That's true. I don't think a commercial necessarily needs to offer that kind of visual information. In the case of pad/tampon commercials, I and most women understand that period "blood" has a consistency different from water. Any research online will reveal this, and thats where we should be gathering information, research, not commercials. 

Seeing that depicted in a commercial won't change anything for me, particularly because the items themselves explicitly state their absorbency capacity (light, regular, heavy, super, super plus, ect). I completely understand, I don't need to see it, just like I don't need to see, in a commercial, how gauze works, or how stitches work.


I prefer avoiding surprise graphic images whenever possible.
