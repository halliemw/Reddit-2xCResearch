Any plans yet for the wedding? I know many people nowadays go for a low-stress, short ceremony with a few close family/friends, but others opt for the bigger event. 

Y'all look adorable, by the way! You both just look so completely enamored by one another, if I were you I'd have this framed and hung somewhere where I'd see it every day!
