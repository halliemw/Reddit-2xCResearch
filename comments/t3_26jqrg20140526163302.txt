Be nice to everyone but don't let anyone push you around. You are a person deserving of respect as much as anyone there. 

Don't be afraid to be your own person. like who you are and you'll attract friends who like you for who you are. Being fake gets tiring and the friends you have will only know the fake you and not the real you.

Get into a club or some other extracurricular activity you're into. That's the quickest way to make friends and keep your school life from being just work. 

Do your homework and try to stay active in class. If you're ever having trouble in a class, talk to the teacher on how you can improve. They can't help you with what you need if you never tell them you need help. They want you to succeed. 

If you ever need someone to talk to about anything (seriously, anything that's bothering you from depression, bullying, troubles at home, sexual harassment, or just having a bad day) go talk to your guidance counselor. You can even skip class to go there if you're having a particularly shitty time.
