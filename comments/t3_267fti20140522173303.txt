> The fact that they need to wear a hijab before they're allowed to do these things shows the precise sexism that I'm criticising.

Well, you got to start somewhere and right now the hijab is not the priority western feminist make it out to be. 

In addition hijab is about far more. The right to practise your religion openly, the right to go to a mosque, the right to go to a school attached to a mosque and learn how to read and write. 

I know several women who in their late 50s started learning how to read and write just so that they could read the quran. You have no idea how much confidence and self-assuredness this achievement gave them. It was far more liberating for them than not wearing hijab could have achieved.

>And what is the reasoning for this commandment? So as not to cause men impure thoughts and harass them, correct? 

In all religions there are commandments where no explanation for their reason is given. The closest thing the quran gives for an explanation on why women should cover up is as a symbol of faith and piousness so that they can be recognised as muslim women that follow the laws.  

Not to cause men impure thoughts is a more modern interpretation. 

>The responsibility for changing behaviour lies with the men harassing them.

Yes, which is why men are also supposed to cover up (from navel to knee at minimum) and told to "lower their gaze". 

You'd be surprised how many muslim women's right activists argue with the quran and the ahadith in their hand, demanding more respect from the men on the basis of some tenets of the faith or stories from the early years of islam.
