He sounds like an absolute sweetheart, and I'm so glad you're both waiting until you're completely ready. You say you know for sure he loves you for who you are and not for how you look, so trust him. I'm pretty sure he's going to be more excited about what he gets to do in your pants than the scenery down there :p

Also, talk to him. Let him know WHY you're uneasy/taking it extra-slow. You don't have to be too specific if you don't want to, just let him know that you're not confident because you don't look like a porn star and listen when he tells you he doesn't give a fuck. And when the time comes for you to get down to business, pay attention to him actively not giving a fuck and let yourself enjoy it - it sounds like you've got a relationship that'll make it more than worth the wait.
