Really, I apologize for even commenting. Obviously the only opinions that matter are ones that everyone shares.  I have never been called stupid, illiterate and a dumbass for simply having an opinion.  I really am sorry I spoke my mind and even bothered trying to have a discussion. 

Also, I'm a woman.  I guess anyone who disagrees must be a man or something.
