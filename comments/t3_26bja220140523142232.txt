Sometimes it takes being a little bit extrovert and moving out of your comfort zone.

  I consider myself an introvert, psychiatrists would probably label be a sociopath, going out to clubs or parties, even family gatherings put me on edge, but allowing yourself to be more than a label or a checklist will help. 

 I only have a few friends, but I cherish them more because of my introverted side, quality of friendship over quantity.

side note - Good book on introverts [Quiet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Quiet-power-introverts-world-talking/dp/0141029196/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400872846&sr=8-1&keywords=quiet) by susan cain, bit heavy on psychology side, but good.
