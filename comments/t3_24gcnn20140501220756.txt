On a related note, I was talking to a friend about this article, and about how I was kind of tired of stories featuring women with really gendered problems- like I know there's totally a time and place for those things, but I also think that it's much more likely for a female character to have a gendered problem (i.e. dealing with society's expectations of women conflicting with her own desires) than an ungendered one (like... uh, the dark lord Voldemort killed her parents as a baby, and now she goes to a magic school where people keep trying to kill her), and I'm a bit bored with it now. Like, yes, yes, many women have had periods, I think I'm solid on that topic by now.

But then I realized that, man, there really aren't a ton of stories about men dealing with gendered problems, like, you know, society's expectations of men conflicting with *their* own desires, or struggling to fulfill their position in society as men, or their first boner, or something. And, I don't know, maybe there should actually be more of that, because I bet that would be helpful for boys, right? That would be cool.
