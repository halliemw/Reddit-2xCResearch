Pretty much what I meant with a general idea, but not super accurate on an individual level. I mean, someone with a BMI of 18 is a bit underweight, but if they're short and their whole family is kind of skinny without being sick, that's still normal. Those are things that need to be taken into consideration for these tests to work on the individual level. A film about soldiers in a war a long time ago probably won't pass either, but that's to be expected.
