The mods decided that the sub should stop being one thing and instead be a more public space to try and advance women's issues. They chose to make the decision with no community input and they've since been wildly inconsistent with their responses to people who ask "is this permanent." They have rejected the idea of a poll and I will be interested to see what they say to the idea of a petition. But my assumption is after being interviewed in the national media the mods will have no personal interest in backtracking on this decision and will keep the community in default. If you miss what twox was, I suggest checking out 2xlite and femmethoughts 

Edit per mods demand
