I agree totally and as a UC Santa Barbara professor put it: “Any student can request some sort of individual accommodation, but... the presumption... that students should not be forced to deal with something that makes them uncomfortable is absurd or even dangerous.”​ How to study slavery, or the Rwandan genocide, or the Communist purges, or the Holocaust, or the Crucifixion, or the prose of Toni Morrison or James Joyce, or the speeches of MLK, or the debate that surrounds abortion, or psychological experiments about the human willingness to take orders, without risking trauma?".
