Absolutely this. One time I was with a (girl) friend of mine at a bar when a dude started hitting on her super aggressively and feeling her up. When she said that I was her girlfriend he took that as an invitation to put his hand on my ass too. He then told us that 'not everyone here is trying to hook up', with each of his hands still on our respective asses. Okay buddy sure thing.
