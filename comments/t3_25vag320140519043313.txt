Im always terming people my cycle is not affecting me as profoundly as its expected to do. If I'm stressed when on my period its because i'm in pain! Id i'm offered chocolate, i'm going to say ok, at ANY time of the month.
   I think some of these articles about women's hormones ruling their lives can be inherently harmful. Ive remember seeing an article in my college newspaper about how girls should think twice abut taking hormonal birth control because it will stop them being attracted to their partners. They didn't seem to stop twice to think about implications of encouraging young women not to take birth control.
 So I'm glad this study now exists to confirm what we all know, hormones do not dictate behaviour.
