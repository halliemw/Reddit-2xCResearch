Men grow up thinking that what women do is in order to please men. It's so all over everything that they don't question it. "I don't like women who wear a lot of makeup" is also the kind of comment that plays into that mindset, although subtly: it shifts the motivation of a woman doing something for herself to doing it to please men. And I know that sometimes it's really just expressed in a casual conversation, but usually they don't notice how it fits into the whole picture. A man versus the whole of women.

I've often heard or read comments about how men don't like short hair on women, but it's usually spontaneous, and not the answer to a question regarding their preferences. Coming forward with a generalization like that sounds like the person feels their opinion should have a pronounced effect on the other person's choices.

Pro-tip: switching from generalizations to direct comments, although if you don't like the haircut, you're not obliged to mention it. "I really like your curves" VS "I like curvy women", "I like your style" VS "I like women who dress classy". Compliment from an individual to another individual.
