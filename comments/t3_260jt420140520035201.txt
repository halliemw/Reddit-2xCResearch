I'm not really sure what to say. Is she really that bad or has it just been lately she's been worse?
I know a couple of school teachers who, even amongst adults, have a tendency to still ask if people need to use the toilet or occasionally pull the "Don't do that! You keep your hands to yourself!" stern face, so perhaps it's a case of she's just so used to doing that in her day job (Which according to you focuses specifically on women, which I can see skewing her view a bit  - if she worked somewhere that focussed specifically on men, I can only presume the opposite would happen) that she finds it difficult to switch off? Not that it excuses it or anything.

In any case, is it worth talking to her about how it makes you feel? Actually it's probably not, but it's definitely worth talking to your boyfriend about it. He seems to be aware of her enough.
