>  Am I wrong to think Sister1 should be replaced by an employee who can show up to work?

It's not wrong to think that, but it might be illegal for your company to act on that. 

Firing someone because she's taking time off during a pregnancy invites a lawsuit.  You say that you are not legally entitled to days off, maternity leave, etc.  You only need 50 employees to be covered by FMLA. You only need 15 to be covered by the ADA (pregnancy might be a perceived or actual disability) and by Title VII (gender discrimination). 

"But wait, it's not that she's pregnant, it's that she's also constantly looking at baby stuff, and gossiping, and is annoying."  Sure, it would cost your boss a lot of money and time to prove all that, and the boss  still might lose.
