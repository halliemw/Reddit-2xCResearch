> Women aren't just hyper sexualized in media, but in everyday life. When I go out to clubs, then majority of women I see aren't in business suits or nice lose fitting outfit. They are wearing thing that I would expect a sex worker to wear. Even if I'm just walking through the mall, I mostly see low cut tops and Yoga pants everywhere. However, thats besides the point, as most of these girls are women under 30 and the truth is Media does over sexualize women. 

Yes, and that's all part of the problem. Saying "but it exists here too" doesn't somehow negate the fact that it's an issue. It's something that needs to change.
