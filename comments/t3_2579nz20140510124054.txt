Exactly. If she is that concerned notify his parents, not the cops. She knows the area where he lives and his last name. It shouldn't be hard to find a number or address. 

I, however, don't think for a second that the crush is suicidal. He is trying to manipulate her. Being the guy that was going to kill himself for a stupid crush could impact his life permanently when his name comes out on a police report. But, then again, he is the one playing with fire and being a manipulator. Maybe the right call is to call the police. I don't know.
