Hey girl! I've dyed my hair multiple colours over the past three and half years; red, pink and blue, including blonde and have been able to transition every time with some basic knowledge of how the dye process works, and of how Caucasian hair works (because that's my own hair, and I've only had real experience with myself and my two sisters!)

Based on the most recent pic you linked to in your edit, your hair is a light pink, more darker at ends and lighter at roots. 

I would suggest, if your hair isn't already fried like hell, to bleach the darker parts of pink near the end. Leave it in just to bring that pink down. If you can get it to a brassy (orange-ish) colour, you would then use purple shampoo to combat that, (or if there's no brassyness, just blonde skip that step) and then use a dark brown dye next or a dark blonde should work nicely too, as the pink would be gone and you could put the dark blonde over your plain base hair now. Use permanent dye for this option of dying over old bleached hair.

If you don't think you can bleach it again (I've been there), go for a  brown with a tint that you like (ex, auburn has a base of red, which might be best if you still have red in hair: should blend fine.) As well, if you go this option, I highly recommend dying your hair with manic panic, or some other brand that uses pigment and conditioner (semi-permanent dye). It's different than chemicals and can be weird to get used to, but it's perfect for growing out colour, and best of all, it repairs your hair, and doesn't damage it. They have a lot of colours of brown as well and is available all over North America!

To be honest, pick a hair colour you want next and I can give you some options on how to get there! If you want to do a pastel pink with the hair you've got, take some more bright red dye, mix it with 3/4 parts conditioner and leave on for 45 min before washing with cold water.

Hope this helped! Feel free to message if need be:)
