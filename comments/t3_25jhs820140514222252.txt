I had this amazing realization years ago that despite the fact that I was lucky enough to have a pretty thorough sex education no one ever told me that it was ok for girls to want sex. 

Not only is it ok. It's perfectly normal. But I had a lot of trouble accepting that side of myself. And all because I didn't know I was allowed to want sex.
