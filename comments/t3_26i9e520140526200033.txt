Yes, it feels as though a lot of people failed me. It has definitely created some trust issues. I spoke with a therapist for about a year after it all took place. My parents often took part in my therapy, which was super supportive and nice of them, but because of this I was never comfortable talking about some of the more serious emotional and psychological issues that I experienced. I briefly spoke to a counselor at my college but the counseling provided is more geared toward short term goals so it was pretty ineffective.
