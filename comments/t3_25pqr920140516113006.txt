You said she makes $20,000 less than the other people of her equal position and power...who are 90% men.

Please explain this a little more -- are you talking about other people working for her company, or other people in her given position across companies?

And, the 10% women...are they also making $20,000 less, just like her, or are they making $20,000 more than her, and it is just her making $20,000 less?

The details matter.

She should approach this, not from a gender standpoint, but from a work standpoint.  If others in her same position at the same company are making more, and she is doing the identical work, then she should request a raise or an explanation of why she is being paid less.
