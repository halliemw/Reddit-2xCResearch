Well I don't agree with that statement but we don't have to debate it. But my point is that abortion is often portrayed as a non-event, when in reality it most certainly *is* an event. I had to stay home for 3 days when I had my wisdom teeth out. My mom had to take a day off work. I had a bad reaction to my antibiotics and experienced unusually intense stomach pain. I had to use extra care when eating for quite some time. Etc etc...
