>  I hate to feed the MR trolls, but the vast majority of crime 'reports' are bullshit. This includes rape. We take a lot of reports for rape that aren't rapes like we do every crime. 

How do you know for a fact? Statistically, only about 3% of reported rapes are deemed to be false. And most rapes (no matter the gender or sex of the victim) aren't even reported. So do you just privately judge these people who have had the courage to report it? And then put these reports in the file, never to be seen again? No wonder cops in many places have a stockpile of untested rape kits 

How does this work? Isn't it your job to take the reports and take action?

Then again, I've been threatened with a disorderly conduct arrest *for crying* at a police station while trying to seek help directly with someone else after an officer left my house after saying he'd be right back to take a report ( for a trespassing incident) and then left and went back to the station. I can't exactly say I'd be surprised.
