Not to put this part on you ... but a mod response to that admin post, (and the one by cupcake  claiming the had only been 2-4 instances where they were legit) would have been good. Unless it happened afterwards?

Those admin posts *suck hard*. So much discrediting :( 

I appreciate your response. It's nice to see that it is being believed regardless.
