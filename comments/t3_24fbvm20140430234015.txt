Trust me, I share your distaste for the term! I couldn't think of another way to concisely explain what I'm trying to do. 

It's definitely more about the combination with other interactions than just about the IM. I actually think it's really sweet and it made me smile. And I can see how it could just be a friend thing too. That's why I'm thinking I'll just hold tight for now and see if it escalates any more before I say anything. Thank you for taking the time to post!
