I had this a similar scenario happen to me a few months ago too. Had a couple dates, didn't even get to the sex part, but I just knew I didn't feel "the spark". You can't MAKE chemistry happen. He was crushed that I didn't feel it and was very angry with me, and told me my standards were ridiculous. Meh.
