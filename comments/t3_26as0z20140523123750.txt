It just works out to $30 a week based on how often we need it.  Sometimes we only do it once a month, sometimes we need it twice.  And sometimes we are away and don't need it for 6-weeks.  It just works out to $30 a week, or $15 each, over the year -- which feels much more manageable than thinking about the sum for an individual cleaning.

Also, now that we get things cleaned professionally fairly often, it takes a lot less time to get things done when they do come, because they are more thorough than we are.
