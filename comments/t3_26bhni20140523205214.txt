Haha, my current long distance girlfriend of almost two years plays Neopets and we met over Club Penguin years ago. Great drawing and I'm glad to hear things are going well for you all!  
edit: should clarify my girlfriend is 17 and I'm 19. just because she plays Neopets doesn't mean she's really young. :P
