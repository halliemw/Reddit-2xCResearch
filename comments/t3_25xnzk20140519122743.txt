Unless its anime, I don't think anyone would be entertained by a Female beating someone up with triple F's and that would create an even more serious problem it they did. But while you argument is "Why does she need to have them?", mine is "Why should it matter?" 

Comics are a form of entertainment from the imagination of the artist that created them. If the artist feels that their female Heroine should have Triple F breast, That's their choice. Who are we to censor them? We don't have to like everything the artist draws to appreciate the story they are trying to tell. And if you don't like her story arc, read a different comic. 

I use to like rap music. But now most of the rappers now put out music that I don't enjoy. But I don't get mad at them because they're making music I can't enjoy. I just find an artist who's music I can listen too.
