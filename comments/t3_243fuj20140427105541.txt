Part of it depends on you. I prefer vibration whereas my friend prefers penetration. She cannot get off with vibration and vibration makes her uncomfortable. Also Amazon, if available, is a good place to start looking for things and if you have Prime, you can get it lickety-split. 

I didn't start masturbating until I was in my mid-20s. One of my friends hosted a sex toy party where we all got together, drank wine, and talked with a vendor about different products. We got to touch them and turn them on and see how they worked. I found that really helpful (being able to talk to someone) because she talked about different ways to use them (with or without a partner), how to clean them, and if you have any specific allergies what you should and should not get.
