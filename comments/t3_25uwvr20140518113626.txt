Karma is only a shorthand for "attention" - if Reddit removed entirely all points measurements from the site, people (some people, at least) would still get their validation by saying "it's got 5 replies already" or "it's nearly at the top of the subreddit's frontpage".

This is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of this site.
