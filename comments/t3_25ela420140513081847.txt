Outraged? Hell no. Speaking as a bitter old hag who chose not to have kids, I am ALL for breastfeeding. A baby with a tit in its mouth is a happy, content baby. A happy, content baby is a quiet baby. Win-win.

But seriously, I'm all for it. Anyone who'd shame a mom for breastfeeding in public should examine their own belief system as to why they think it's something that should be hidden.
