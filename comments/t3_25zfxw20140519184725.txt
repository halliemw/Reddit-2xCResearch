My parents never formally told me anything about periods, and I thought I had had violent diarrhea during the night, the first time I had mine (brown dead blood, you know how it is). I think that that, quite possibly, was worse than thinking I was bleeding out and dying. *Kinda* wish I'd had some prep before then. I was pretty young, I think 10? Well before school sat us down for any sort of health education. Just wanna impress upon you how much that totally sucked balls. 

So... yeah. Really, there's no reason *not* to talk about it now, just in case. It might also save you a set of sheets and pajamas.
