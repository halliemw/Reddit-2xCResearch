I understand that you feel upset and embarrassed, that is natural! But girl, you didn't do it on purpose! And hey, be proud that you are having good, happy sex! Maybe you could do the opposite and just say hi to your neighbors. That could possibly ease the awkwardness. And now that you know, just be quieter and all is well :)

P.S. It could be worse: Your parents could have heard you having intense sex. Ha!
