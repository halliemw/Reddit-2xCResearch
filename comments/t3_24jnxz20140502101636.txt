I've always wanted a Cube. I personally love the form factor. It handles really well, gets good gas mileage, huge windows makes for great visibility while driving, and while it actually isn't too much bigger than my old Ford Focus hatchback, the interior is HUGE. There's SO MUCH ROOM in this thing.

EDIT: It's also a nice conversational piece. So far I've gotten a lot of "Ugh, you got a CUBE?!" and then I'll have them sit in it and I'll drive around a bit and then they've usually changed their tune to "...Y'know, this actually is a pretty cool car."
