You really have to be careful about that if you want to foster open communication and diverse opinions, like this sub does. Especially when we get flak for being an echoing chambre for only one narrow opinion. Of course, there is no single "female opinion", but if we start censoring *too* harshly, it becomes easier for people to say that. It might become harder to defend our status as an opening, welcoming community for all non-assholes with a focus on women's perspectives/opinions (plural).

I'd say maybe be quick to delete but slow to ban. Unless somebody says something just blatantly stupid, like "stfu c*** ill f* ur mom", and then yeah, they deserve an instant ban. But mods could delete comments where there's a good point but maybe bad wording, and then ask them to repost without causing offense. And if they couldn't, then switch to the banhammer.

Other subreddits are very quick to ban. Like, I was banned from the feminism subreddit but I didn't break any rules and didn't say anything mean or contradicting feminism or anything. I'm still not even really sure why. I think somebody reported me who didn't agree with me. I don't blame the mods, I doubt they had time to really think about whether I should be banned or not because that place is a steady flood of trolls. Because of their strict rules they keep out a lot of the BS and have created a relatively safe place for women to read about feminism, but maybe not to contribute. They're losing some of their actual contributing members, which is something I've heard confirmed from other people in this subreddit. Men's rights and redpill are two other, more extreme examples, where if your opinion disagrees with the mob opinion, you are instantly banned. We all know the general consensus on those places. I wouldn't want us to become anything like that, turning away ladies from one of the few safe(ish) spaces on the internet for us.
