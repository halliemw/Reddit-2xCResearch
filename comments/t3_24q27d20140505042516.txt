Please check out the book 'women who love too much ' by Robin Norwood. 

The fact that he pushed to move in together so quickly is a massive red flag. Checks on you constantly when you're at work which is another one. He undermines your self esteem a lot,  which seems to not have been mentioned in that conversation.

Of course, if he was shitty all the time,  you would leave. So he needs to pretend to be an amazing man as well in order to keep you. 

Look it's been only 6 months and you already had to look for help here. Prepare yourself for more subtle manipulation from his side :/
