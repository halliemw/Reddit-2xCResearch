Is it too personal to ask, but was it only the psoriasis that was having your immune system on overdrive? I'd appreciate some nudges towards any kind of illness I could have, because so many have been tested for me and all of them turn out great. I've even considered psoriasis, but I don't have any indicator or symptoms of that.

Thank you so much for the comment and your offer to chat! I can relate to the shameful remark, I don't know why either. It's probably because people connect parasitic infections with dirtiness? That's probably it for me.
