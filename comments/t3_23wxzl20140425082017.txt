If you had a pap smear, sometimes you will bleed afterwards, not due to roughness, just due to irritation.

But not talking to you or warning you during the examination is poor practise, especially if it made you upset or uncomfortable. I also agree that you should ring the main office to give some feedback. Don't be rude, just be constructive, explain that you had a bad experience and that the GYN you saw needs to work on their bedside manor.

Unfortunately there isn't much else that can be done, finding a good GYN is very hit and miss, and like you said, this GYN used to be pretty understanding.

Its important to make yourself heard, when you see a GYN, even one you have seen before. Remind them that you like having them talk though what they are doing down there, and that you like plenty of lube. They deal with so many women who have so many preferences and needs sometimes they forget that vagina's are attached to human beings. It's not your job to remind them and I'm not trying to victim blame, but when its your vagina, you might want to remind them just to be on the safe side.
