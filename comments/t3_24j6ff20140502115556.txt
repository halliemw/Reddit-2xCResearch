This is so inspirational! No kids yet for us, but I often joke that my husband would be a much better house-husband than I would be housewife. We both enjoy our careers but I think I just have more of a passion for one specific thing while he is more laid back and open to more options...I hope we can someday work our lives out and both be fulfilled like in your situation.
