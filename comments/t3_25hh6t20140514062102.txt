I faced the same downvotes because I did wait. I got married at 23 to a man I'd dated since 17. I've been downvoted for waiting until marriage to live with him. I've been downvoted for taking his last name. I've been downvoted for being a stay at home mom. 

Or, more accurately, I've been downvoted for daring to imply that the way I've done things makes sense and is as valid a way of living as the single-through-your-20s-then-maybe-marry-your-favorite-sex-partner way.
