Unprotected sex to excess can be a dangerous thing. But I don't think dangerous is the same as immoral, as long as everyone involved is honest and informed. I think traditional morality, such as encoded by many religions, fails by not making this distinction, leading to all sorts of religious and secular laws, taboos and rules against victimless "crimes". I would not use slurs against or judge the character of people who do drugs, for example, either. I think it's nobody's business.
