No idea either; the few pregannt women we get at our community college bus get silently 'sent to the back' by the non-disabled students hogging the front seats. If by any chance I'm up front I offer my seat but get stared at by the rest of them like I'm some sort of alien.

For us I'd say most of the students that go there are not from the best part of the county/best living conditions so they may have those social skills yet. Not excusing their behavior but its the only thing I can think of.
