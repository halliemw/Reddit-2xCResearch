Listen, even if you were jogging naked and jiggling around in front of him, he didn't have the right to touch you. You didn't give consent for any kind of physical contact. This wasn't your fault, and I'm glad that you seem to know that. This guy sounds like a total scumbag... 

Even if you are worried the police will be assholes, just be strong and file a report. It might pay off, and there's nothing to lose.
