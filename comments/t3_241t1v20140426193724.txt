Ahhhh, I know this feeling all to well. I'm 28 and I often let my anxiety stop me from even TRYING to do things I want to do because I'm so afraid of failure (how is not even trying any better? It's basically failure by default!) 

Anyway, I'm very glad to hear you're sending out those applications, regardless of your doubt. Keep on it. I've found with fears the old standby "Fake it till you make it" is really true, you really just have to force it sometimes. And after you move and live in that new city for awhile it's no longer that scary thing you didn't think you could do, it will just be an everyday part of your reality!
