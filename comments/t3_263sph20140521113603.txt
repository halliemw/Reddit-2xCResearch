Honestly, I'm not sure if this is a factor or not, but the ONLY times I've developed UTIs (twice in the last 5 years, totally not complaining about that!) was when I'd been regularly having sex with circumcised men (a partial reason as to why I shy away from the unturtle-necked dicks). 

This seems like an issue outside of what you're dealing with, but it's food for thought! 

ALSO, I'd suggest drinking a TBSP of Apple Cider Vinegar with about half of your glasses of water on top of cranberry juice. It's a weird taste to get used to, but AVC does PHENOMENAL stuff for your urinary tract and helps maintain a strong pH.
