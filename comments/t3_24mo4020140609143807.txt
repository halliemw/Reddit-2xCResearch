Ah a narcissist. My father is also a narcissist. I've dealt with that by having a LOT of personal space and having very shallow conversations or get togethers once or twice a year. He can't handle anything real or dealing with the terrible things that he has done. A narcissist won't change until they defy their personality disorder and realize that no one is around because of them. That doesn't happen too often.
