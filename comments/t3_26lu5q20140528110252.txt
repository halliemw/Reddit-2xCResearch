This is probably going to be buried now but I just wanted to say I know how you feel. I was properly slim when I was in my late teens, but I'm now in my late twenties and have developed a round little tummy and soft thighs. 


I know I could get back to the weight I used to be, if I wanted it enough. I don't exercise hardly ever after all, I could just put the effort in. But I don't *want* to. I love food. I love chocolate. I love soft cheeses, and pate, and cake. I like steak and chips, and scampi, and really buttery mashed potatoes, and crispy onion rings, and vanilla cheesecake. I like eating food that tastes good, more than I want to be  slender again.
