I'll reply with another man's point of view. Additionally I am a stay at home dad who recently finished his master's degree and do most of my work from home. I also take care of the house and keep my son 3 of the 5 days a week. The other days I do work from home but make just enough money to cover a couple bills (tv, internet, water, electric) while my SO pays for literally everything else including filling up my gas tank every week. As a man, many people look down on the life I lead staying at home taking care of the household but you know what, it takes both financial income and home stability to make a life. We have found a balance that works and works for us. Who cares what your family and friends think. Everyone balances those things differently, and at the end of the day, if you have food on the table and a relatively clean organized house than who can say what is right and wrong for you. Your SO is right, you need to be happy. If that means doing less housework and working a few more hours a week than so be it. If it means quiting your job and focusing on school and the house then so be it. You all need to find your balance because no one else can tell you what works for your home
