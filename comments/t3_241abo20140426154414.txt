Unfortunately I can describe it because I've been in a couple of abusive relationships.  Yeah, two.  Because apparently I didn't learn much from the first one.  (Don't do that.  Totally not worth it.)  

Of course you miss him.  That's normal.  It's okay to miss him and miss the good parts of the relationship and miss the guy who was so charming, especially at the beginning, and shared stuff in common with you and that you poured so much of yourself into.  

It took me about a 6 months after my last relationship to stop missing him and stop being depressed and mopey.  The 6 months after that was a lot of anger and bitterness.  It was really a good year or so before I was able to start letting that go and stop having this ghost take up space in my mind.  You'll get there too.  It just takes time.
