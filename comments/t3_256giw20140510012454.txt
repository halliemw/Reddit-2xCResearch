You need something a little bit "stickier" than petroleum jelly to tame eyebrows.  Clear mascara, if you can find it, works well.  (I have a scar running through one eyebrow that made it grow in funny directions.  Years of using clear mascara and a little careful plucking finally tamed it.)  If you're going to try and shape them, thicker eyebrows are good, they give you more to work with.  If you can't find clear mascara or eyebrow gel with a mascara type brush, clean up one from an old tube of mascara and use that with light hair gel or mousse.

For the shiny face, maybe try rice paper?  It absorbs extra oil and leaves behind a thin layer of translucent, colorless powder.  Translucent pressed powder (the Covergirl type) or cornstarch appled lightly with a big powder brush can help, too, without giving you a made up look.

I know you said your hair was a problem for another day, but finding a really good hairstylist who can give you a cut that works with your face shape and the way your hair naturally grows can make a WORLD of difference.
