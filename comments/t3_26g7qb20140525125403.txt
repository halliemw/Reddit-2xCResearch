Seconding the boyfriend sentiment.  Text your closest girlfriend, your sister, your mom, whatever.  They'll know what to say or at least what will make you laugh a little bit.  They'll get the crazy that you're stuck in the middle of.  My old roommate and I live thousands of miles apart now but we keep in touch a lot when it comes to girly things.  (If you're reading this, Darcy, I freaking miss you.)
