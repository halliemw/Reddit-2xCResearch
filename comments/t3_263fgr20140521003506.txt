Yes. I have never, ever, ever, regretted taking the time and energy to take care of my husband's needs, and I think he feels the same way. 

I guess, more than anything, I may be annoyed at first that I have to not do _________, or get hot & sweaty, what ever, but I have never been mad at the end.   It may not work for every one, but it works for us. We are both, very, very, very physically affectionate people though.
