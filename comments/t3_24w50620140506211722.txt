Well no, not necessarily. I think that may have been part of the point of this video.

The medical knowledge is out there and women having and abortion get the opportunity to ask questions before hand. But that information is about the medical procedures and risk. It can't answer the questions that I think may be pressing for a person about to have an abortion. Things like: how will this feel physically, how will I feel about it, how will I feel (in all respects) afterward. 

Obviously this video can't answer those questions. But I think it has value is showing one of the many reactions a women can have. I also don't think self-censorship for fear of being the less-than-ideal portrait of a woman who has an abortion is helpful to anyone other than people trying to make the procedure scarier.
