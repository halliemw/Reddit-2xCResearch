I'm 22, and I have never been offended by someone referring to me as a "lady", "woman", "gal", "young woman", or "dudette". 

"Girl" **can be** infantilizing, and "female" is dehumanizing (unless it's used as an adjective, i.e., female scientist, female race car driver, female politician). 

Edit:

Because I'm getting multiple comments saying the same thing, let me clarify. "Female" used as an adjective is only non-offensive if you **need** to use it. Saying "oh she's a *female* doctor" is offensive, while, "I need a female doctor," means the adjective is necessary. 

Also "young woman" can be used if someone is talking down to you ("young woman, just what do you think you're doing?") but can easily be used in a non-offensive way ("you're a beautiful, strong young woman.") You could say nearly any word **can** be used as an insult depending on tone and context (hey **buddy**, think you could get the f outta my way? Vs My buddy Dan has that car)
