The removal procedure is very simple!! All we do is pull it out. Often women do not feel anything, or some mild cramp. Yes, the insertion can be painful mostly because of the instrument we use to hold your cervix in place. I recommend that women take 600-800mg of Ibuprofen before any insertion (assuming you do not have contraindications to this medication) which can sometimes be helpful. As others have mentioned, yes you can get another one placed immediately after getting one removed, this seems to work quite well. Glad you are happy with the Mirena!
