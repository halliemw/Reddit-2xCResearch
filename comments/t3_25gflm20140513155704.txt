Thanks for the reply, I did look past that.  

I looked right past it to point out that this "I should be skinny because of my actions"/"Everyone else should be fat because i try harder" attitude is incorrect.  I tried to do it in a positive and encouraging way.  If she wants results not excuses my post is a friendly positive way to do it.
