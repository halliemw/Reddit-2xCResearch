I've been around here for a while and I think 2X has had several waves of "trending" posts. Do you remember when we all posted pictures of our mothers? That lasted at least a day, with the majority of links being pictures of people's mothers from the 70s or so. Or what about when everyone was all excited about no-heat curls? Or what about the time everyone did that melting crayon rainbow art? So right now we're trending gross body functions. This too shall pass.
