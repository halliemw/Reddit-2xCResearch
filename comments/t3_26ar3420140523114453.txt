I have tons of tattoos, for the most part the most job issues have been with fast food places. I currently work in web design. One of my arms has tattoos that go to my wrist, you can always wear long sleeves.

I would talk to him and find the root of this. It is your body. Have you been wanting this tattoo for a while? One person commented and said he might find you less attractive (I certainly hope not!)
