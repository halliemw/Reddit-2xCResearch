The annoyance of trying to get the wrapper off the tampon! The brand I buy here (non-applicator) have the clear plastic wrapping that you're supposed to be able to twist off by turning top and bottom in opposite directions. But it never works, so then I have to painstakingly peel the wrapper away at the glued end. It's so annoying I keep meaning to contact the company to complain.
