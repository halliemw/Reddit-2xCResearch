I'm sorry you're going through this and I commend you for opening up to someone close to you about the issue. 

But I agree with mudclub that your boyfriend has never dealt with something like this and so he can't help you to the degree you may need support and help in starting to get over this issue. You've viewed yourself in a negative light for years and it's going to take a lot of work to feel differently. I think when your boyfriend said "not to eat too much" it's because he had made you promise not to throw up and so he didn't want to to overeat and be triggered and compelled to throw up. He's with you and attracted to you and does not see you as unattractive or big or any of the things you are seeing. I'm sure a lot of his actions are very unintentional and because you feel insecure you're seeing his actions as unintentional and dissaproving. 

I've suffered from body issues for a long time and I can get triggered very easily by other's actions. It took me a long time to realize that a lot of the time I was putting the negative connotations on things people were saying. The only thing I can say is no matter how hard it is it really is worth seeking help professionally, as bulimia is very psychological and hard to work through without proper support. Also from my own experience, trying to put that energy into more positive forms of activities like working out and preparing healthier meals can be really beneficial. When I started realizing that my body could feel great and that I could have a body I felt happier with, I started to avoid purging and skipping meals.
