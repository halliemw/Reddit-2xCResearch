I was always the taller girl in the class but as I came from a tall family I felt normal and that everyone else was small. 

The great benefit of my height I discovered when I was 16 and working in the city at night. People, including creepos, were scared of me. Men left me alone and I didnt have to feel scared. That was an awesome. Now that I work as a teacher my height seems to instill respect. 

Now I do have an never ending battle with shoes. However the wonder of the internet means I can just ship shoes from the world to my door. 

My partner at a size 15 mens has problems however. Even when shipping shoes from America.
