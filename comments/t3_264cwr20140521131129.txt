>Nobody should just assume dominance and for any good relationship to work, NEITHER of you should "wear the pants." Do you get what I'm saying? You can't make a relationship work if one person is always calling the shots, there has to be some give and take.

I just want to take a moment to clarify that all relationships are different because this felt like a very narrow view of relationships. Not all of them are 50/50 or even 30/70. Relationships work when the give and take is equal to what both parties want and it makes them happy. If OP wants a 0/100 relationship, it makes her happy, her partner wants that responsibility and is happy to be in that role, there is no reason to assume that relationship would not work. 

Clearly not the case here, but I digress...
