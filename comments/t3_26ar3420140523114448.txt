Yes, some places do care about visible tattoos. I don't work at those places. In the end, it depends on what field you're looking on getting into. I had a bf at one point tell me he wasn't comfortable taking me to his work functions (very corporate) because of my pink hair and how that would be perceived. It was strangely hurtful, because no one would ever have accused me of behaving inappropriately at this kind of thing. 
I think its probably important to take your hubby's opinions into consideration - though I have an easier time with that when I'm not being forbidden to do things. He may think its a bad idea and that's fine, the cost and the issue of job-tolerance for tats are definitely things to think about. But if that's how you choose to express yourself - more power to you.
