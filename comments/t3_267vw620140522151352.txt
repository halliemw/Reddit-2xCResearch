Well my sex drive went up because I was just excited to be covered by the implant, so no idea there. But the period thing? I bled for like three weeks on and off and then from there it was just occasional bleeding. I got it in the beginning of October and got my first proper period Sunday just gone. So if it's only every few months I can cope! If you're really struggling talk to your doctor about it, if you've had problems before maybe the side effects are lingering a bit due to that?
