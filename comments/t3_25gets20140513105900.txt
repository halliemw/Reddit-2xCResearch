Im a resistant shaver, I dislike shaving because of how uncomfortable it is to grow back. However, leaving hear 'untreated' makes you a target for abuse and bullying. 

All through mid-school I had hairy arms and was made fun of quiet viciously. Funny thing was even a girl that was 'popular' and picked on me was picked on for her body hair.

I dont understand why humans are l ike this. We shame others until we make them uncomfortable woth themselves forcing their decisions to change their styles and outputs.

Had I not been picked on about it,  I dont believe I would be a shaver to this day. Now im on the borders I shave when I feel. Yet I am no wear an brave to wave the **bush** flag but I do let my arm hair grow as it pleases until ive had enough of looking at it.
