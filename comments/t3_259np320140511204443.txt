>  I suppose I was trying to decide whether or not I am a rape victim

This is what I was worried about.  We all go through shit in life, it is up to you how you will let it impact you.  Of course there will be things that are huge.  This doesn't seem to be one of them.  Don't let anything define you.  The more you can let roll off of you in life the better.  

We can live by labels as "child of divorce" "widow" "recovering alcoholic" "diabetic" "orphan" or "victim" or we can choose to live in the moment and be.  

You aren't changed in any way because you had a two-minute sex act with a boyfriend who seems as he thought you were consenting.  You are still you.  

Feel free to talk about it if it is important to you, but I almost feel that you are taking cues from society that you feel that this situation must be a big deal.  Tell me to f' off if I am wrong, like I said, I wasn't there.  Maybe it did feel like he was actively acting against your wishes and it deeply affected you.  But it sounds like the entire relationship was bordering on abusive and it is unnecessary to focus on this one act just because it could have a strong name.

I am sorry you are being downvoted.  You seem sincere.  But I am curious, did this experience seem more violating than all of the public and sleeping gropings?  I mean, I am really asking, not saying it shouldn't.
