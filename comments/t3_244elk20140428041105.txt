It's perfectly normal for them to tear a little from time to time (whether first time or 1000th). It could certainly be that if you'd had more foreplay or lube that maybe you wouldn't have bled; it's also perfectly possible that it was unavoidable in your case. Everyone is shaped differently, some hymens are more elastic than others, etc. 

I don't think we should be shaming people who bleed on their first time, of course. That would be ridiculous. But I do think that we should be teaching girls and women to expect more from sex than "a mans penis will break you open". That's just ridiculous. Unless there's a medical abnormality, most people should be able to have sex without bleeding. If it happens, it's not a huge deal, but we should be teaching how to avoid it since tearing can potentially lead to infection or scarring. 

That's how I see it anyways, but I doubt it will be taught like this is any widespread way any time soon unfortunately. There's too much shaming involved with the way sex ed is currently taught.
