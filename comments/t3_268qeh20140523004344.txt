My point was it sounded like you were ok doing those hours until you got laid off, else you would have said something. You think people get advanced notice when they get let go? Maybe a text or email? And you think these people were jerks? They sound nice enough to give you a severance. If they really wanted to be jerks they could have gave you nothing and laid off hundreds and thousands of other employees along with you. I have worked at places where the guy who laid off people got laid off right after he laid off all those people. Let's find someone to call a jerk in that scenario.
