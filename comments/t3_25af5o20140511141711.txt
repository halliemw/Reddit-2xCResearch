My mother died in a car accident when I was only 4 months old. I ended up being raised by my grandmother (and until she passed away, my great-grandmother as well). They kept as many of my mother's things as possible, and I used to go through them all the time when I was younger, trying to learn about her. 

I remember how thrilling it always was to find something - a scrap of a note - where she mentioned me. I only had four months with my mom, so unfortunately there's not much. I only have a handful of pictures of the two of us together, including the pictures from the day I was born. But I do know that she loved me from the moment she saw the first blip on the sonogram that would eventually become me, so I will always have that.
