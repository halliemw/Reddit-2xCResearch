Actually I work retail in a small town with generally friendly people. A lot of people hang around and talk to me and strike up conversations while I am at work, it's just never the guys that ask me out. Sometimes people will hang around as long as thirty minutes to talk with the employees and exchange stories and the like. That's why I made the emphasis to state that it's always the guys that don't talk to me at all or know anything about me that ask me out.
