Well people often use the argument that breastfeeding is 'natural' and therefore everyone should be fine to see it. Just because something is natural doesn't mean everyone has to be comfortable with seeing it, hence why I think going to the toilet is a good analogy. It's a natural thing that is necessary for everyone, but not everyone wants to see this.
