Hoo boy sure sounds like high school.

Generally the most given advice is to sever contact completely after breaking up, at least for a while. Or if the breakup was bad and you think the person is shitty, forever. (For me all of them have been forever cut out; some people stay friends, it just depends.)

So no, I think your friend's reaction is totally normal. If you were the person inviting him, then that's not cool.
