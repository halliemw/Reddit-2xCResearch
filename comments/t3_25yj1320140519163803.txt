When I had my Mirena removed, my GYN told me to take a deep breath and let it out. As I exhaled, she tugged the string and that was that. I felt a weird popping sensation as she pulled it out, but nothing painful. No cramps afterward, and she even held it up to let me take a quick look before she trashed it. I was probably there for about three minutes--maybe 30 seconds to prep for and perform the removal, and then she answered a couple of my questions and I got dressed. That was it! I haven't had another inserted, but hopefully your second insertion will be smoother :)
