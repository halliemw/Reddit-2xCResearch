This!  Too often, women are depicted as a smiling receptacle, passively waiting to be used.  

Losing the V-card as a guy is always depicted as:  1] Super easy and "natural" (never with details, of course);  2] Being given a gift from a experienced lady;  3] "Rising to the occasion" to show your virgin GF a good time.  

It's just as awkward for a guy as it is for a girl.  My first time was with my fellow V-card carrying long term gf.  There was a day of build up doing other stuff and then we got to it.  All the cliches were had:  I was too nervous and went soft, she didn't give me any feedback (I asked!) on what's good/bad, "Is it in?", I shot off *just* when it was getting good, and lastly, the cleanup...
