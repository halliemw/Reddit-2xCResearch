I second the subreddit recommendations from /u/LelanaSongwind , especially /r/loseit. It is a VERY supportive community with lots of great info (check out their [FAQ's](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq)).

It is simple but not easy--you just need to burn more calories than you consume. My fitness pal is a great tool that can be used on your phone or computer to track calories. This can be a way to monitor yourself, see patterns, and identify calorie-dense foods that are holding you back. Giving up or cutting back on sodas, for example, can be a great way to cut a large amount of calories from your diet.

Food prep can be VERY helpful, I like to make lunches for the week and portion out snacks like baby carrots or pretzels so that they're easy to grab and go. Drink lots of water! :) Hope this wasn't too disjointed. I've lost about 70 lbs total and I certainly don't have all the answers and it's different for everyone but feel free to message me if you have any questions!
