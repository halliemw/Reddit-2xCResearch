I'm kinda in the same boat, kinda.

They say that college (uni for me) is the best place to meet new people and make new friends. Well I've been in uni for 2 years now and I don't have a single friend. I mean I talk to people and I laugh with them, but they seem to have a better 'togetherness' about them.

I don't like the same things they like. I'm not interested in celebrity gossip or excessively talking about your SO or talking for hours about what you do when you are drunk. But the women I've met seem to spend ages doing that so I try to join in. But I think that they 'get' that I'm not like them. I want to be though! I want to be giggly and girly and up for a laugh.

What I'm trying to say is that I understand your pain OP
