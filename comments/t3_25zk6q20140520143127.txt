Others have touched on the miss/ms/mrs thing. I only add that I go by, "Ms. Vuhleeitee" at my job, because I work with children, am not married, and consider "Miss" a bit too young for someone in a position of authority.


Master is a bit outdated, but my aunt plans events/weddings, and I work for the military, so the more formal day to day is just the norm for me.
