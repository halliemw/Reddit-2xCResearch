They would lose a far more than they would gain. As a male, I would stop watching GoT if they started such nonsense. 


Nobody watches game of thrones for the nudity. In the age of the internet, we don't need nudity from a tv show. I watch game of thrones because of the story and to be frank, this season has been a joke.
