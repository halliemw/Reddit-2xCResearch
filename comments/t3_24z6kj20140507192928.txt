Specific argument aside, the author loses a lot of credibility when he links to an article that references the widely debunked 77 cent wage gap.

I find it hard to believe that a person who claims to be familiar with the debate would make that mistake. He is either not making an argument in good faith or is not well-versed in the discourse.
