>Rape is having sex without full informed consent. 

>One horrific thing does not rank higher on the horrific scale than other.

I agree with the first one, but I don't think I can agree with the second. All rape is wrong and horrific, but it does a disservice to a woman who spent a month in the hospital recovering from critical condition to say that OP's experience was just as bad.
