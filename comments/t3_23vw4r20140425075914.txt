Take care of your body. Tell your boyfriend about the problem. Try different positions/more foreplay, more lube... Also go to the gyno to get checked. Find guy who has a right sized penis for you. Don't ever let anyone disrespect your body, and ask yourself if you really like his sex that much, ask yourself it it's healthy play or abuse.
