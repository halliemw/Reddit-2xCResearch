I am also a long-time user, and a woman, and I agree I have not seen too much of a difference in TwoX (other than the obvious frequent posts complaining about default status). Otherwise most comments I see are the same supportive dialogue that I've always found here. However, I am easily triggered and tend to avoid posts that might upset me, so maybe that selection bias is skewing my perception. I wouldn't be surprised if that was where the influx of inflammatory comments were, so maybe I'm just not seeing them because I don't typically visit those threads anyway.
