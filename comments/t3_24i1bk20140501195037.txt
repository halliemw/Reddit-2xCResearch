My whole body is covered in moles, most of which I despise, except surprisingly my facial ones. Personally I don't think it's a horrible mole. I think if it's making you uncomfortable get rid of it. I have gotten two moles removed about six months ago about that size. There is a minor scar and healing for one of them took forever.However I think the scarring will diminish a lot more.  I am beyond happy, but no one else cares or notices. (One of them my boyfriend only cared about because he would hit it while running his hand down my back, so it's good it's gone) Anyway, totally up to you, I understand the frustration.
