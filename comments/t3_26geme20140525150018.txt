Not sure about the "in front of his wife" thing.  If this person is truly a friend then no backup is needed.  Just tell him that you're a bit sensitive about your weight and ask if he can be a bit more polite about it.  Any sensible person would stop bothering a friend about their weight if they said something like that.
