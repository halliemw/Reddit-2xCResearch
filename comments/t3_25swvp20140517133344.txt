You are not alone! It may feel like that, but know that you're not. Lots of these experiences sound similar to my own. You have a right to be safe from sexual assaults at all times, just like every other human. You have a right to your dignity, like everyone else. You have a right to love your body, a right to your safety and security, and the right to say who, when, where, and how others touch your body.
I'm still in the process of figuring out how to advocate for my own safety and protect myself. It seems like every time I go to a party strange men grab my ass and grope me. I don't go to as many parties, and I don't wear what I used to. 
What I've found helps is surrounding myself with female friends. We are always looking out for each other at all times. I have a couple guy friends who I can trust, that I've known well for years. When I'm on the street, or walking from somewhere, I don't smile at men or make eye contact with them. It's just a good way of showing you are absolutely not interested. Some of my friends have fake wedding rings as a way to discourage aggressive men.
Ultimately, it can be hard to find your strength and dignity in a society that generally encourages a specific view and treatment of women. It's a societal problem that's generally (and I say generally because there are some kickass men out there) only recognized, legitimized, and addressed by the people it negatively affects. It's not easy, but keep your chin up! You are a human being, inherently deserving of every human right. Continue demanding respect, and try to cut those people who don't give it to you out of your life.
