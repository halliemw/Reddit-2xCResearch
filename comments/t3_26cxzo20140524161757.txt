This is probably the best advice here so far.  As bitchyoumustbejoking said, you really don't have to rush anything.  Take the time to explore and do what feels good.  It may take a little time to really get into g-spot stuff (but there are other fun places).  There are also vaginal toys made for dilation that may help (especially in combo).  They often come in sets with a range of sizes.  You don't really have to power through anything, it could/should stretch with time, instead of tearing. 

If there are more major issues, you may want to see a doctor :  if it's not that serious they may just advise patient, self-exploration.  If it is more major, you may want to hold off for surgery or you may risk more substantial injury than some tearing.

I went the route that you're (OP) going over time (probably a few years, actually - but I didn't actually know about the g-spot or anything until I was already experimenting there).  I played around with a small peanut vibe and my fingers for a long time before getting other fun stuff to move onto.

I also agree with another of BYMBJ's points - a lot of people do seem to think that sex with a man is the first sexual act a woman should do.  Female masturbation is a weirdly touchy subject.  Whatever I had of a hymen was long gone before my first experience with a guy - and he even said I was lying about being a virgin (no pain, no blood, I wanted/needed clitoral stimulation and knew what I liked) when I'd really only said that I'd never been with anyone.  He was one of those guy's hoping to take advantage of my inexperience.
