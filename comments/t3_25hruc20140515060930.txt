GOD NO! You sound like you are unhappy- but is that because you are single or because other parts of your life are unfufilling? If you are dissatisfied with your life as a whole a hubby is not a silver bullet. A friend of mine is actually going through the same thing as you and has invested time with increasingly shitty relationships in a desperate race to snag a man while completely ignoring the fact that her workmates are bitches, her health has taken a dive and she hates her housemates. Somehow she thinks getting a boyfriend will fix all the other stuff. Actually, depressed people make shitty choices and the last douchenozzle had her ringing me in tears last saturday. If youre unhappy, look at the rest of your life and see if there is something you can do to make your life a happier place. As for relationships? I attended the wedding of my stepsister last year. She was 36. Her and her husband are like gross cute teenagers together. She was single-completely single- from 28 until she met her husband at 35. And a happy through it. She had great friends, cool family (lol) and a job that was challenging and rewarding. Im not saying that it never gets lonely without an SO but if the rest of your life is good your sure dont have too much time to think about it!
