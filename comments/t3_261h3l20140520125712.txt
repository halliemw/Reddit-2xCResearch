thanks for the answer, though I appreciate the thoughtful responses and are helping me a lot, it's refreshing to see the "scientific" side. 

I do not have noticed the alcohol part, though, but my change needs are mid-term and I drink alcohol occasionally (normally when I'm partying) so I don't think about the meaning of life when I'm drunk. I will try next time, promised :)
