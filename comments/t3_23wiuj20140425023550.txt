10 year Wall St vet here.  It was a huge struggle at first, a few things have helped me immensely: dressing with authority is what I call it.  Not going out of my way to look overly masculine by any means, but not calling attention to being a girl with crazy make up or nail polish.  It's all in the details I've found, in terms of attracting additional attention.  I also don't change my hair, keeping the same hairstyle for consistency. Secondly, it took me years to learn the locker room lingo, despite growing up with a brother.  I'm sure you have an idea of what the guys around you are into by now, pick up on it, join the conversation.  That way, the next time taunts come up, you can direct their bs to topics they actually have an opinion on, shifting the focus from you to them.  And let's face it, guys love to talk about what they're into. :)  And when it comes to division of labor type stuff, all the "make me a sandwich!" type crap?  I let it roll off my back.  But like 2d20x, I dish it out too, so it's turned into more of a banter between casual friends, than anything mean spirited.  Keep your chin up!
