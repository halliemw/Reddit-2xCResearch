I had mine for about 8 months and experienced similar symptoms to you, including mild depression and cystic acne. I got it removed in February and am back on the pill, feeling much more like myself and my skin is clearing up. My GP said my symptoms were unlikely to get better considering I'd had it in over six months. Plus I was just fed up and ready to murder someone unless they took it out.
