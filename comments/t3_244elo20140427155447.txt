Here's a good primer that I found:

It sounds like the mini pill might be a good option for you, depending on a few things. Your obgyn will know more but some studies suggest that it's less effective if you weigh over 175 lb and much less effective if you're over 200 lb. And again, you have to be very good about taking it. For my pills, I keep them in my purse and have an alarm on my cell that goes off every day to remind me. I'd suggest the same to you. You might also want to look into the Nuvaring, which is more localized and might have fewer side effects

Edit: wanted to point out that the weight data is still VERY new and inconclusive. I don't want to worry anyone. Studies are still underway and only really started in earnest after the data came out about plan b's effectiveness
