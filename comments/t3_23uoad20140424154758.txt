Yeah, the first paragraph basically says 'These men are creepy for making obscure references and expecting me to understand them', and the second paragraph basically says 'these men are assholes for assuming that I'll only like popular modern fluff and not be interested in obscure or older media.'  

Either of those positions is tenable, I guess, but I don't think you get to make both claims at once.
