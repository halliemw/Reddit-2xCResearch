I just want to say I understand how you feel. I actually gained a bunch of weight to make it stop, and when I work to lose it I'll lose a ton and the catcalling and men approaching me will start up again, so I self destruct to gain weight again. I walk everywhere so I used to get followed, people yelling that they want to rape me from cars, and I am a shy introvert with anxiety issues already, so I just ate crap. Sadly I don't have any advice, I just want to say I believe you and what you went through. I'm about to start working out and am already starting to lose weight again, now that I am 40 and not 20 I hope I'm too old to hassle.
