Together, read the book "the gift of fear". It is amazing and talks about the patterns and habits of dangerous men. It was such an eye opener.

Teach her the concept that if someone breaks a social contract with you, you owe them nothing. Meaning--if he's rude, be rude right back. Don't continue being polite. 

And overall, don't make her feel like it's just in her head. If she says something made her feel uncomfortable, listen to it.
