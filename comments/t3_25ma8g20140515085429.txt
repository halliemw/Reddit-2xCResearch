One thing that helped me personally, and might also help you is starting up a hobby and getting good at it. Dedicate yourself to getting really well versed in something like playing an instrument, gardening, art etc.

Once I picked up a few different hobbies and dedicated to them, whenever I succeeded within those hobbies, it gave me a huge rush of pride and drove up my self-worth. For me it was playing music, but everyone is different, so find something that makes you feel passionate.

However do keep in mind that this isn't an instant gratification kind of thing, you really have to put some effort forth before there's a pay off.
Good luck.
Keep your chin up!
