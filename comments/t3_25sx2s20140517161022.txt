The fact that condoms exist makes your point irrelevant. Having sex with a lot of people isn't the problem. Having *unprotected* sex is the problem. Safe sex prevents STDs better than you can prevent many other diseases. It's completely ludicrous to say that people having sex with multiple partners will be inherently unsafe, which is why being a slut isn't a bad thing. Being a slut just means you have sex with 'a lot' of people. It doesn't mean you're not smart about it.
