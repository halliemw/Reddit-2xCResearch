>  She would likely survive the pregnancy, but had only about a 25% chance of having a "normal life," Kelley remembers the doctors saying.

If a scientist created a human life in a lab that only had a 25% chance of living normally, and the other 75% chance was that it would live with some sort of misery, we'd all view that as extremely immoral.

If you're going to create a life that has the ability to suffer or be happy, then you're responsible for making sure it's got a pretty good chance of living a decent existence -- or it's just immoral to create that life.

I don't see why creating a life *outside* of a lab should be any different. No one should be able to use their womb as a factory of human misery. There is actually another life we're talking about here, it's not just about you.
