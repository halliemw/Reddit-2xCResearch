One could easily argue that breasts not being considered sexual in such cultures is a result of social construction and that finding breasts sexually attractive is the natural state of things. I'm trying to say that breasts have multiple functions, including a sexual component as well as a reproductive. But since everyone seems to think I'm the big bad man trying to subjugate women's sexuality, dont take my word for it.
