Saying no. It's been one of the hardest things for me, because whenever I said no to someone (asking for favors, for example), I'd get a 'you're such a bitch', 'I knew you wouldn't do it', 'You'd do it if you loved me', 'Wow, I can see how much you care about me with that answer'. I felt that I had to say yes to everything people asked of me, otherwise I'd feel like a horrible person. It's taken me *years* to finally be able to say a firm no and get it over with, but it hasn't been easy.

Also, masturbation! Although I never stopped doing it, I felt sooo bad afterward :( I was raised in a christian family, and all of that was 'totally disgusting', but I couldn't help myself. Now I think it was really bad for my parents to tell me natural urges were disgusting, but I definitely learned a valuable lesson for when I'm a parent and have to teach my kids that masturbation is okay and natural.
