from the blog post:
> We were also a little grossed out by all the dads on the balcony above the dance floor, ogling and talking amongst themselves.

why are male parents who chaperone/spend time around young people assumed to be ogling everybody? i usually dont assume that everyone who looks at me when im wearing a dress is ogling me.

also, it was a woman who complained and threw the girl out, right? sure the woman said the dads complained, but she had personally already chastised the girl. it seems like mrs. d and the lady who ran the prom screwed the girl over.

why do the post title and article blame the dads and patriarchy? seems more like misguided religious nonsense to me, and that stuff comes from women as often as men.
