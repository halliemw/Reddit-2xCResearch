I think what Lena does with Hannah in Girls is a far more effective example of a body positive icon *because* the fact that she doesn't look like most women on television is never brought up. I can't recall an episode that was ever focused on her wanting to change how she looked, and that is huge to me. Most of the time, an overweight person's character is almost completely revolved around the fact that they're overweight. Lena never discusses it and I really appreciate that.
