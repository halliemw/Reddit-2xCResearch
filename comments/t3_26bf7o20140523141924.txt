I fucking love overalls! I have several pairs I've worn for years, and I don't care how unfashionable they are. Although someone recently pointed out to me that [Gwyneth Paltrow has given overalls her seal of approval](http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/03/gwyneth-paltrow-will-live-in-overalls.html), which kind of makes me question myself.

(Not really. My love of overalls is stronger than my dislike of Gwyneth Paltrow.)
