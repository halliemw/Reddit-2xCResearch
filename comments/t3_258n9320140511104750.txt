I have a bikini for hanging out at the beach/river/lake, and a speedo for actual swimming.  I do say that if a bikini fits right, you shouldn't have to constantly adjust it.  I'm pregnant now, and was having a bitch of a time finding a suit to lap swim in, so I bought a bikini that just lets my belly hang out, and still supports my enormous boobs, and it's awesome.  Title Nine has some good ones that are made for surfers that don't ride up, and that don't come off.  :)

But seriously, wear whatever you damn well please.  Bikini, one piece, 1930s bloomers...who cares, as long as you're comfortable!
