For me, inderal worked well as a prophylactic (complicated explanation, but inderal is beta blocker and in my case, helped a lot - low dose every day for a long time).  

Each time I was pregnant, the headaches went away (ditto for a year following childbirth).  I used to joke that I now knew why women would have 15 children.

As I've aged, the migraines lessened - and now, with menopause, they are gone.  Something to look forward to??

So sorry, anyway, for your pain - Feverfew didn't help me, inderal helped, aspirin/caffeine/naproxone cocktail helped, alcohol worsened.  Aspirin by itself was better than no medication.

For the record, I experienced other things along with those migraines and so does my migraine-prone daughter.  Hormonal birth control made them much worse for both of us (including implants, IUD's with hormones, etc).  Thank god for IUD's without hormones.  I had irregular periods, heavy periods (would never have known since I thought they were normal), eventually anemia as well - so be sure to have annual bloodwork done also.

Good luck.  Feel free to message.
