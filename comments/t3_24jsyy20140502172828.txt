> Howard said she made her decision for several reasons, including: The girl had texted Young asking him to spend time with her; the girl had agreed to have sex with him but just didnâ€™t want to at school; medical records show the girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby; and Young was barely 18 at the time.

What?? Why is her sexual history a deciding factor in this? I feel like the judge has decided this girl isn't some shining beacon of purity because of her sexual history and therefore "wasn't the victim she claimed to be." Ugh, ugh ugh!
