You don't sound like you were ready to lose your virginity, but what's done is done. In the future, don't let anyone make you feel obligated. You can't always just go with the flow. You have to stop and think if this is really what you want. I know that can be hard in the heat of passion, but you'll feel better if you decide what you want instead of just going along with what he wants.
