I use to debate and presenting your side is called an argument. Sorry I forget other people don't debate.

Yes saying my entire argument does count because men isn't used as a noun is not only nit picking but a way to try to disregard my argument because you can't actual counter that feminist theory dictates that all men are part of the patriarchy. Actually come up with an argument instead of new way to say check your privilege.

I was merely giving an example. People say they're coming for our guns and yet no one says who they is. So again who is the they in this so called society that gives men all this power and privilege?

The definition that the patriarchy gives men power and then they oppress women is not only universally accepted but a requirement to be a feminist. With out the so called patriarchy there is no reason for feminism in the the first world. If you're a feminist you should know this. The definition I linked says almost the same thing except the part of feminism being pointless. Just because a definition isn't word for word doesn't mean it suddenly changed to something else.
