This is exactly how I feel. I mentioned dogs specifically because I used to take the family dog for long walks as a teenager and didn't feel the feeling you described then. I think it's something to do with purpose - I can walk with a dog alone because I know they're enjoying it too, I can drive alone for hours or sit on the train alone without feeling lonely because the activity has a purpose, a destination. 

Maybe things like beautiful views and delicious meals are just things we need to share with another human, we are social creatures after all, maybe it's inherent. I don't know.
