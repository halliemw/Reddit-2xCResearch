> Putting someone in that position in the first place is wrong.

Everytime you hit on someone, you are putting someone in such a situation.

> I work in a corporate environment. Hitting on people is not acceptable.

Context. It's not because you're a cute representative that they should not take you seriously and instead hit on you. There's also a difference between a directive meeting room and a counter, mainly because of the power that is involved. Then again, you know that most big business-deals are closed in informal environments, where alcohol is served.

> Because it's inappropriate at work.

Let me repeat myself: it's about context, if you think that everywhere is a good place and time to hit on someone then you're a social unadjusted, but to think that it's always inappropriate, you're just plain wrong. Maybe for you it's always inappropriate, but that is not true for all people.

> Maybe you need to start being a little more professional

You don't need to tell me anything about how to conduct my work. I'm not the same person at my job as I am in my private life, but I do know how to say no without feeling awkward, gross, or insulted. I'm not that fragile.
