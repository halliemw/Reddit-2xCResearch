Maybe I didn't explain it well enough, but what it comes down to is even if people consciously acknowledge something as stupid or wrong, unconsciously their views are affected. It really doesn't matter how persuasive the argument is, what matters is abundant and extreme it is compared to more moderate and reasonable views from either side.

I have numerous empirical studies backing this up. It's not just some idea I pulled out of thin air.
