It might not be a bad idea to grab a book with good diagrams and talk about and teach her proper names for her own anatomy. She doesn't need to know about adult uses for those parts yet, but knowing what's going on in there will make it less scary. She knows a little bit about what the experience will feel like from you, but a more solid understanding of what's actually going on and why will give her some framework for it.

I was a dorky little 10-year-old who had found an old physiology book so I knew some of the science behind it (though not what the experience would be like) and that made it a lot less "oh god! blood is coming out of me!" and a lot more "I have to put up with this every month? great." 

Good luck, sounds like you're off to a good start. What she doesn't know can definitely hurt her, but don't be afraid of getting it all wrong, seems like we all bond over the stories of things our parents only got partly right.
