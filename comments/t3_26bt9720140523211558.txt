My mom made a lot of things for me like cross-stitches and clothes. I really cherish that kind of stuff and want to make the same things for my little girl. It's just so special to have those things that your mom made for you.  It's like a little bit of love in physical form. I [embroidered a few hoops](http://i.imgur.com/YIhT9rJ.jpg) for her nursery before she was born. 

I love my fox tattoo!! Thanks!
