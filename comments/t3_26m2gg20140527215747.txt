I don't like most of my family, either. My mom especially. She has always rubbed me just the wrong way that we never really get along.

I came up with this saying: You can love your family, but you don't have to like them.

Meaning that (barring any horrible crimes or whatever) you'll be there for them when they need it, but there's not really any relationship going on at all.

I accepted a looong time ago that my mom and I were two very different people.
