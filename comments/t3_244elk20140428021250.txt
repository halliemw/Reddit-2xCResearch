>is that there's nothing wrong with wanting to have casual sex. It's not wrong to want to have sex with someone just because you think they're hot or whatever, 

I will raise my kids teaching them not to do things that negatively affect their physical and emotional well being. There's been a lot of studies done on the psychological impact of casual sex and I believe that the conclusions are mixed. So while I wait for more studies to come out I'll be teaching my kids to be extremely honest with themselves, to educate themselves about the repercussions of their actions (all actions) and to take care of themselves. People are different. I've seen some people have casual sex and it's no big deal. I've seen others engage in casual sex and it fucks with them. Sex is complicated.
