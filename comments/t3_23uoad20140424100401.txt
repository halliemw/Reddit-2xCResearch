So.. my first impulse was to agree with some other commenters that this isn't sexism.  But then I tried a thought experiment:

Let's switch this scenario to a T-shirt that makes negative comments ("jokingly") about black people.  And the company *also* offers the same exact T-shirt, but about white people instead.

If someone were walking around wearing that first shirt, the one with negative comments about black people, would you find it racist?  If the person then tried to justify that shirt by saying "well, a white version exists too", would that be an acceptable excuse?  Does the answer depend on who the wearer of the shirt is (e.g. on their race)?  

My general feeling is that if a white person chooses to wear a shirt with negative comments about black people, that's racist regardless of the existence of another similar shirt about white people.  I'm not sure if the mere existence of these shirts is racism necessarily, but in this context it's at least very problematic, since it very easily allows for people to express hurtful and racist views while using the existence of the second shirt as an excuse.

So.. can we apply the same logic to the fangirl shirt, or is there something about sexism that is fundamentally different than racism?  Maybe the problem is that there's no ungendered way to refer to a fan-person, and this shirt is just exposing how our needlessly gendered terms are problematic in and of themselves.

I think now I'm inclined to think that while the existence of this shirt is merely problematic, any male wearing it is probably being sexist.  The problem isn't the shirt, exactly (free speech and all that), but the people choosing to wear it.
