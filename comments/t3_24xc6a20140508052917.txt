As much as I would like to believe it, the story is much more sinister than that.  I found out today that apparently someone complained about the cats and requested their hiding place to be cemented but did not warn the workers to check for cats before they filled the work order.  She knew the cats could be there and she requested it to be done very early in the morning when the cats were asleep in there.  It may or may not have been intentional.  At this point, we simply don't know.  

The problem here, the professor who takes care of the colony told me today, is that the hole used to be huge so when the cats did hear those noises they hid in the hole.  So if they were there and heard the noises, they probably just went deeper.  And if they saw the men approaching, they hid in hole and felt safe there and didn't come out precisely because of the noise.  Since none of them came back for their food (I stayed up all night watching from a distance) and haven't been seen anywhere on campus they told me that, based on their experience with those cats, they are pretty sure they're there, unfortunately.

The good news is that the professors did bust the concrete today.  They were able to open hole as big as two tennis balls and now we just have to hope they had enough air in there for 24 hours.  We're also hoping that they did indeed cleared some air passage, cause there's a possibility that there are still stones deeper that they just couldn't get to.  Without tools and without the cooperation of the planning department, they were not able to dig any deeper and we don't know yet the direction of the tunnel or even if there is a tunnel, but at least we didn't smell anything, so maybe that's a good sign.  The rescue will proceed today, so maybe there will be some good news.
