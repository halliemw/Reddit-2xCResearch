> In recent years, I've developed a complex about speaking my mind, It's something that I've spoken to a counselor about and have been working on, but I still find it really tough to speak up, even when I really want to or think it's necessary.

That's actually not surprising, if you get this kind of dogmatic all-or-nothing stuff from your mom regularly.  People who are all-or-nothing are often really loud about it and really good at shutting other people down, especially if they are an authority figure and you are being raised in a family system they control.  It makes it really hard for the rest of us to explore nuanced points of view.  

Everything your mom told you is a crock, and shame on her for trying to shame you.  Some people just seem to get off on demeaning other people so they can feel better about their own righteousness.  This is her crap, not yours.
