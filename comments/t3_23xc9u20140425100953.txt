They sound like they all have disordered ideas of what a healthy body looks like and in order for them to keep that skewed frame of mine your body must become (to them) "unhealthily" skinny in order for them to feel good about theirs.

Another thing is that when someone in a family makes a significant type of change in his or her life there is almost *always* a pushback from other members of the family for things to return to "normal." Just one of those weird parts of family dynamics that makes it harder to do things differently!
