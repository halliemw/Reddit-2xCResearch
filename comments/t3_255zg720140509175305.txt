Start writing letters to your wife and children. Write about your hopes and dreams for them as they reach each milestone. Write a letter to your daughter about her first date, her first lost tooth, graduation, marriage etcetera. Share stories about how you and your wife met or dated that are written to their older selves. Or even do videos for them read bed time stories to your kids on tape. You keep the memories alive for them, and create new ones. 

For your wife do the same thing, help to have your affairs in order. Will, bills, anything and everything to make it easier on her when you're gone. Knowing that she's a type A she's going to blame this on herself, but she'll try and keep everything else around her on point so she will feel like she has some control over everything. 

I'm sorry you're going through this.
