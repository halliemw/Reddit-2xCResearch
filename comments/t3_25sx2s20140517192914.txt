I don't think this is true at all though.

I know plenty of people that are complete misogynists who would never slut shame and the people I see slut shaming the most are often self proclaimed feminists who for whatever reason take issue with promiscuity in women.

There is some over-lap sure but the issues are not necessarily one in the same. In some instances it's not even a gender thing. Some people still have puritanical pre-marital sex is wrong mentalities.

I think the usage of the world slut serves a purpose actually. It's kind of appropriating the word and taking the punch out of it. I honestly take issue with the concept of forbidden words. It keeps the idea alive by giving it power.
