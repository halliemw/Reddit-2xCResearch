Hi, I'm sorry you're going through this! As I read what you wrote, I thought that maybe your bf told you not to eat because he wants to avoid having you throw up. Maybe his communication skills are not good enough for this sensitive situation. It might help if you talk to him about what you'd like to hear from him, or ways he can help. Chances are he's scared and doesn't know what to do. Good luck!
