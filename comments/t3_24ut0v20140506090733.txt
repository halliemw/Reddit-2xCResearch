You made a rape joke. We could quibble about how maybe you should have gotten a warning or whatever, but honestly I'm fine with the policy. I mean it's not hard to get another user name and come back, so I don't think getting banned was a big burden for you. I think the itty bitty cons of banning someone with no warning for rape jokes far outweighs the harm of the many women who would be offended by your words, whether you meant to offend or not. 

And I don't really think you learned your lesson if you're not thinking about the implications of putting "butt hurt" in your post.
