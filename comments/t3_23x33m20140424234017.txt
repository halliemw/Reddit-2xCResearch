I know you feel very scared but you come off as very calm and collected. I have absolute faith that you will be able to handle this. I have faith in you. I think it would be a good idea to bring a friend with you to get your things, and I second what others have said about your mom. It is not your responsibility, and there is very little you can do. She is an adult and if or when she leaves that has to be her choice. You are doing the right thing for yourself now.
