Yep, cleavage hair! It's darker there than any other area near my breasts and I don't know if this is because I have shaved there (isn't hair growing back darker after shaving a myth?)

I don't think people would say that. I shaved my arms once in middle school because a kid made a nasty comment and I felt bad, but then I realized that I didn't like the way my arms looked not-hairy and I only did it because of what that kid said. I notice when girls shave their arms, but that may just be me. I don't think it's so uncommon that people would comment on it. You could try it out and see if you like it, too!
