Yeah, I agree with your friends.  There is no bad Buffy... there's only Best Buffy, and maybe Not Quite as Best Buffy. 

Okay, I'll admit to having a huge girl crush on Willow.  If there was ever anyone I'd go gay for, it'd be her.  That may color my perception a bit. ;)

The musical episode took a while to grow on me initially.  Most of the cast are not musical artists and I kept cringing and hoping they'd hit their notes.  Having seen it multiple times now, the demon guy gives a very solid performance, Tara's voice and her song is amazing, Anya is incredibly talented, Giles is great but sadly, he didn't get a real cameo.  I honestly think Buffy's performance dragged him down, but SMG is not a singer.  Spike (or James Marsters) actually has his own band and is no slouch when it comes to singing and playing guitar, but somehow it didn't translate very well to the show.  The whole thing is still not one of my favorites but it's kind of a testament to what Joss can accomplish when he really wants to, and given what he has to work with.
