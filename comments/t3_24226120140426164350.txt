I'm pretty sure he is, I convinced him to go to the place I'm going, its really affordable and I like the people there. I just don't think he's willing to work on himself since he JUST started going and when they suggested he go to free weekly groups like I do, he brushed it off like he didn't need it. I don't want to "fix him", but I do want him to get the help he needs to be happy, because I can't do that for him.
