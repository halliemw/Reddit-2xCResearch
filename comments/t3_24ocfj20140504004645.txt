There is no magical leak preventing device AFAIK, but my weapon of choice is OB.  Yeah, you have to get your finger a little bit bloody to get it in.  Don't worry, it washes right off and you get bonus points for positioning it exactly where you want it to be.

Stains still sometimes happen though and for that, hydrogen peroxide is a godsend.  It breaks down blood and especially if it's still wet, makes it pretty much disappear.  (Also good for stains from kitty hair-balls.  Pretty much any kind of protein stain really.)
