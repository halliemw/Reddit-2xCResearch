I've been on the other side where a neighboring couple in an apartment building has kept me up. The main issue is that I needed to go to bed in time to get a healthy sleep for work. It was reflecting on my health. I bit my nails, I was tired at work, I couldn't fall asleep from frustration even after the noises were done. I didn't feel "jealous" like someone else here suggested. The noises sounded extremely fake to me, and when they weren't moaning, they were yelling angrily at each other. I had to move away.

If I was in the complainant's situation, I wouldn't judge you for having loud sex at all. I would only be immensely relieved that you turned out to be a polite person who is willing to make a change. Maybe it is not actually bothering the whole apartment, only her. My ex used to fall asleep to the sounds of tv, and an earthquake couldn't wake him. I doubt a person like him would give a damn. If I was in that lady's situation I would be glad to exchange phone #s and text info of when I'm out and about or when it's bothering me.
