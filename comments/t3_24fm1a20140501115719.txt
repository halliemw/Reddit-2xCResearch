Exactly! I have witnessed the gossip but I have never been part of it so that was a shock to me minus the time I was carpooling with someone that was a creep and everyone thought I was sleeping with him but I corrected that real quick. 

I'm about to make the move for the supervisor/trainer/staff position I just wanted to know all the lines of business first and have a good feel of what I liked best.

I feel like its hard enough to get ahead as it is just working in a call center in general, but to have someone undermine it by being like oh this is the only reason you got it, is what really stung.
