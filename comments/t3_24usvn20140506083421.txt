I responded below but given this info it just seems like your boyfriend isn't all that serious about you. It's one thing to want to keep two worlds apart, but having never met any of them, and never being invited? 

It sounds like he doesn't see this relationship as very serious. You should probably sit down and have a talk about where you see it going.
