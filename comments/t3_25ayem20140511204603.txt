I will say I'm shocked that so many articles were quoting such outdated sources and how few studies there are for modern women. Medicine and general health has improved by leaps and bounds, why are we still scaring so many women?

That said, my major concern about the big 3-5 isn't how fertile I'll be at that point, but how healthy will my child be. Unless more bad sources are being used, the risks of genetic problems past 35 makes me hesitant to want to have kids past that point unless I have to.
