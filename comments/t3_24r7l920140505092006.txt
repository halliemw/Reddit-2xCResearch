I'm so sorry that happened to you. Thank you so much for your reply. I'm still going to the nurse today since I already have an appointment, and I'll suggest it to her. I was thinking about changing anyway just because of how much of an asshole the main OBGYN is. I've always thought I was a freak because everyone told me how easy it should be. Now I might have an answer. Thank you.
