I studied abroad in Jordan and for my first day of classes, I wore a covering (although not a full hijab) thinking my modesty would be keeping in line with the local culture pretty well. All day, locals would ask, "Oh, are you Muslim?" with surprise and interest. They weren't rude about it when I said I wasn't - they just seemed puzzled that I would cover my hair if I wasn't Muslim. "Christian girls don't do this," they explained. 

I guess it's totally harmless, it just feels like some sort of weird misinformation to put out there. It's like having a menorah up during Hannukah and when somebody asksif  you're Jewish, you're like, "Huh? Oh, no, I just thought it looked cool."
