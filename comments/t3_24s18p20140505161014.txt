I think a lot of us are speaking from the perspective of the "daughter" as well. Reddit is full of young, college-aged people. I'm in my early twenties and still consider myself a child. I certainly don't know anything about raising children, and can't really ridicule anyone for how they raise their children, but when I read stories like this, all I can do is think about how horrific it is to be raised in household where parents try to have so much control over their children's choices and their children's live (especially since my parents, while not religious, are very controlling). Of course I'm going to be speaking from that perspective and react to these stories in a hurt and defensive way. I'll try to be polite and respectful, but I see these behaviors as inherently harmful and won't say otherwise.
