It sounds great, doesn't it? The jets were nasty. I bleached out the tub and jets. We never used it, again. It was super loud. 

Our current house has a 5 foot tub. It's mid-century modern pink. We still won't take a bath. We hate the pink. We hate the bathroom. 

It's still better than our early 80's jacuzzi tub. You should try to clean one. GROSS!
