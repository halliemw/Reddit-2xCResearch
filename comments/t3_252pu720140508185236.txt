I'm getting sick of these comments about how we just don't want to be challenged.

The ways in which we get "challenged" will be the same ways we are challenged outside of TwoX.

I really was so hoping to see more debating about the intents of rapists, "As a man...",  being mansplained to and constantly having to tiptoe, clarify and educate so no one thinks I'm some radfem with meaningless opinions. /s


But no yeah I just have a problem with being challenged.
