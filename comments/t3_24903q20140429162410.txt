The cost was one of the reasons that you can now be covered under your parent's insurance until you are 26. Historically, young people are the age group that is most underinsured, but the reason we need them to be insured is that we need to spread the risk out in order to justify to the insurance companies that they now have to cover those with preexisting conditions and are unable to put lifetime limits on insurance payouts. Although it may seem silly to the young population, this policy is thought to help lower health care costs overall - something that will be beneficial to EVERYONE. If something hadn't changed, the entire system was ready to go bust. It may not be the best system, but it's a start. All other developed countries on our level have national healthcare systems - everyone is covered or has insurance. And you know what? They have better health outcomes than the United States. It's only a matter of time before the US needs to get on this system.
