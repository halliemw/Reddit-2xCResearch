No one is shoving anythig down your throat. You don't have to click links that clearly state that the movie is problematic, nor are you forced to keep reading or even take part in the discussion.

On the other side, there IS a lot of stuff wrong towards women in movies, and there is not one reason why we should be barred from discussing it, or even ranting about it, on a sub for women, because *you* are inconvenienced by it. I'd much rather watch movies and be annoyed by a lot of little things, providing awareness that will allow me to help change them, than go on with my head in the sand because I can't enjoy fictional works otherwise.
