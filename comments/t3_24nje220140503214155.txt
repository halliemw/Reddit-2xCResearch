I guess I was a fairly early bloomer? I started needing a bra when I was in 4th grade (I was 5' tall at that point and starting to develop hips, thanks genetics).  About a year and a half later, I started my period. I was devastated. They showed a video about puberty in school, so I kind of knew what to expect, but my family was no help at all. I spent so many years wearing only pads because I was afraid I'd tampons. I wasn't comfortable with my body. I slouched and wore baggy clothes to try to hide how freakish I thought I looked.

I guess my advice would be to try to help her feel comfortable with her body. Talk about pads and tampons and diva cups and how AWESOME the female body is. She shouldn't feel ashamed of her period/hips/boobs/whatever. I also think it would be amazing if you had a menarche party when she does start her period :)
