love love love it. Tantiana Mansely (sp?) is an incredible actor. She plays 5+ clones, all SO different you forget it's the same actor. And the parts where she's one clone, pretending to be another clone, but accidentally coming through with the mannerisms of the initial clone.. i mean holy shit!

I started watching because it was canadian content, and i just fell in love with it .. all the other characters as well are SO great too.

and the new Daario Naharis from GOT is in season 2 of Orphan Black and hes pretty yummy. dat beard.

Binge watch that shit! :)
