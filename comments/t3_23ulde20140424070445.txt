You could be straight up riding your boyfriend in the middle of the street, and it would still not give anyone the right to touch you without your consent. You're not being melodramatic; you're going through something with your boyfriend, so you're emotionally on edge as it is, and this added to it. That creep was doing just that- being a creep. 

The really disgusting thing is, you could've given the dude an earful and told him all about what a vile creature he is, and it probably wouldn't have made a difference to him. Even if you didn't hold your boyfriend back, and he decked Mr. Creep, there are always more. Always people who feel entitled. The world is a sick, dark place but you just have to learn to adapt and realize when someone does something like that to you, you are under no obligation to hold your tongue or otherwise stop yourself from letting them know what trash they are. 

Be careful! And I hope that things start turning more in your favor.
