Sven is a total shitlord. There are a lot of shitlords out there pulling svens every day.  My husband always tells me when one of his acquaintances pulls a sven on him, and it happens pretty often with some of them. Some just HAVE to brag. And guys just love to look. Just the way it is. I never get mad at him for it. I don't care if he looks or doesn't say anything at all. The only thing that is important to me is knowing he would never do something like that to me. Take warning ladies, and get to know a guy really well before you make yourself that vulnerable to him, because I can't tell you how many guys I know of who have done this. Total svens, the lot of them.
