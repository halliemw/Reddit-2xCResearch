Because 2XC is (I quote from the sidebar) "intended for women's perspectives."

Because I have many other subreddits to choose from if I want perspective from men.

Because I feel that there are issues where men don't have personal experience, and I am interested in personal experience.

When I want perspective from parents, I go to /r/parenting, or talk to my friends who are parents. When I want perspective from scientists, I go to /r/science, or talk to my friends who are scientists. When I want perspective from women, I go to /r/TwoXChromosomes, or talk to my friends who are women. Isn't that the point of subreddits? To create communities of people who share a certain perspective?
