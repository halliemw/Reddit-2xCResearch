If you guys aren't that close anymore and you only recently reconnected, her silence probably has nothing to do with the phot incident. Most likely she's just used to not talking with you often and you won't jump back into a very close relationship right away, if ever.

I've gotten back in touch with some of my best friends from 10 or so years ago and while it's great to have them on Facebook and the occasional lunch out, we still don't talk very often despite how attached we were back then. It's part of growing up and older.

I wouldn't sweat it.
