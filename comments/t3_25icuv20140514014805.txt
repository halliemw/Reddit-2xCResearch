I consider myself an intelligent, well spoken person. My second year at university I got so trashed at a party that I was all over someone from one of my biochem classes who I respected a lot. I don't even remember it; I was told about it the next day (and the person who told me was surprised I didn't remember it -- I act fairly coherent even when blacked out). 

You'd be surprised what alcohol can do. 

It doesn't justify his behaviour, of course. But I think the only right course of action is to be like "hey, so... what happened the other night?" and see what his reaction is. Maybe he doesn't realise how out of line he was and needs to be informed. Or if he does acknowledge what he did without remorse, then you know to avoid him from here on out.
