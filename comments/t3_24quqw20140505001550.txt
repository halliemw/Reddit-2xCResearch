Because pharmacologically speaking increased appetite and weight gain are not the same.

There are drugs out there that will literally redistribute fat or increase fat production - this is not tied to caloric intake in any way. A person can keep the same diet, same exercise, same everything, and still gain weight. Of course, this can be water weight too.

Examples: Sulfonylureas, meglitinides, TZDs [all used in type 2 diabetes]

Increased appetite will not cause you gain weight, unless you increase your caloric intake. It makes you want to eat more, but it doesn't directly make you gain weight.
