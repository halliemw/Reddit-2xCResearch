But so many great reasons to start! Mine include: chocolate-dipped jalapeno flavored potato chips, chocolate chip cookies (made with 12% more butter...nomnomnom, they taste like madelines with chocolate chips), ice cream (+maple syrup, or honey), steak, cheese, more chocolate...creme brulee...

It's a good thing I just ate, or else I'd be in for a really decadent evening.

I just realized these are all foods I crave around the time I need a diva cup, haha.

Also, exercise tends to shorten my period and decrease the cramping pains (runner's high? too much blood flowing elsewhere --> not enough to enforce cramping? shaking out the stuff more quickly? I dunno)
