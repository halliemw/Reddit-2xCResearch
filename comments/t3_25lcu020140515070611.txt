Girl here - I was visiting family a few states away for the summer and was riding a random bike from my uncles garage.  They were all "boy bikes".  And they were all, arguably, a little too big for me.      
Things go well.  Middle of the summer my cousin and I are riding the bikes to the beach.  We come to an intersection that is usually full of pretty heavy traffic.  We wait and wait for the light on the crosswalk to give us the go ahead... and we're off.    
I make it halfway across the street when my feet slip off the pedals and my vagina slams into that bar.  Broke my hymen, severely bruised my entire vagina, including my pee-hole to the point that I had to have a catheter for a few days.  I also had a few hairline fractures in my pubic bone that made walking excruciating for the next few weeks.    
   
In conclusion... I agree - girl bikes are better.
