My advice would be to depend on nature rather than decorations for as much of the beauty as possible.  Maybe there's a botanical garden near you that hosts weddings for cheap and has a beautiful spread of flowers, or maybe there's a mountain near you with stunning views at the top and a road you can drive up to get there.

As for ring, look outside of diamonds and gold and things get cheaper.  Don't search for engagement rings, that word adds at least 200% to the price tag, just search for really nice rings you'd like to wear forever.

Consider looking on places like Etsy for a dress, or Ebay.
