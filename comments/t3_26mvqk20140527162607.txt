One of the arguments I've never understood is the "cock carousel" one. Like, where do these magical cocks come from, if not from dudes? Is there no understanding that for a heterosexual woman to have sex with a cock, it virtually always requires a guy? Are they all abstaining from having any sex at all until they want to "settle down?" Do they not realize their own part in it?
