Neuron is almost 3 now.  He's calmed down a lot in the past couple years, but he's still a very active cat.

We got him as a little 2lb feral kitten, the runt of the litter with an umbilical hernia.  He and his 4 brothers were found in a warehouse that was slated for demolition, along with 30 (!) other kittens.  

As soon as he wasn't shadowed by his bigger brothers, he got crazy active.  For example, it took him all of a day to figure out he could travel around the apartment faster by bouncing off walls.  He is now a lean but sturdy 10.5 lbs (hasn't changed since he was about 10 months old or so).
