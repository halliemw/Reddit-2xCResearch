>Brave comes close by saying Merida doesn't need a man but the entire plot does revolve around men. 

What? I think the plot revolves around her relationship with her and her mother.

>Growing up as a Disney girl, I've seen almost every female character's life become better after she found a man. ... even Anna.

Anna from Frozen? I disagree. She may have met Kristoff and enjoyed his company, but the whole end of the movie showed that she loved her sister more than him. I mean, she selflessly sacrificed herself to save her sister instead of getting "true love" from a guy to save herself.

Having an SO can make your life better, but they don't have to mean the world to you. They're a part of your life, not what makes your life.

I'm really not sure if it'll help you much, but I've grown up watching the same Disney movies throughout my childhood, and I just know that life isn't a fairytale and I'm not a princess. Those movies are all fancy fantasies and make-believe used to sell dolls and merchandise. Eventually, you should realize that just throughout your daily living. My best advice would just be to go out and live your life and learn it for yourself. 

No one's life is a fairytale. This quote has been said multiple times on Reddit, but I think it might kind of help in this situation: "The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone elseâ€™s highlight reel."
