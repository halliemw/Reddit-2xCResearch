i'm on the far side of moderately tattooed, inching into heavily tattooed, and i have worked in a professional environment for years without issue. if you get work done, know that you might have to change your wardrobe to cover the ink. the vast majority of people i encounter daily as a funeral director have to idea about my tattoos.
