All excellent pieces of advice! All I would add (assuming you are a young woman who menstruates): Always have a few extra pads or tampons in your backpack or locker at school. You never know when an unexpected period will appear and it's always good to be prepared just in case or to have extra feminine products on hand if a friend happens to be in need.
