It doesn't matter what gender you are, you are going to be upset if your partner is cheating on you. You might be very upset and need to take that frustration and anger out on something (which I don't condone). If the choices of things to be upset with are 

A. Your partner. OR

B. This random stranger

It is much easier to be upset with the random stranger than the person you have been spending all of your time with. It is a desire to not damage your relationship with your partner by fighting with them.
