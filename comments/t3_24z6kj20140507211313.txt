Im not going to say I disagree with you.

> Overwhelmingly, people are nicer to us and more trusting.

Are you familiar with the [Women are Wonderful Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%9CWomen_are_wonderful%E2%80%9D_effect) it seems to say that almost everything you are saying about men....is actually true of women instead.  (theres no such men are wonderful effect) but there is a [general unease, a certain fear of men](http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/).

> Some people get arrested for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Not us, we can be walking through the sketchiest part of town at night, covered in blood, and a cop will stop you to see if we're ok.

Again I think youre speaking to the wrong group.  As a white man I agree I will definitely not be hindered but Im not the gender that is likely to be assisted.

> We can marry/love/fuck whomever we like. Not the case for some others. In some countries, they hang you if you love the wrong person. Even in many of the civilised ones, getting married is impossible.

The state I live in is still trying to ban homosexual marriage, man or woman.

> Let's be honest, being a girl sucks. Menstruating and childbirth aside, they're underrepresented almost everywhere. Did you know that it's actually illegal to set foot on an entire island in Greece if you're sporting a vagina? Oh, and have you seen the figures on domestic violence? Seriously, being us is pretty sweet.

SOme might say having the sole reproductive choice is something of a privilege.  Women are the largest voting bloc in the west.  If anyone is elected it is by their blessing.  I did hear of the island in Greece, its a town of monks isnt it?  Wouldnt that be like a man going onto an all girl's university?  [what about just putting a statue of the opposite sex up?  do you think it would frighten and alarm the residents](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sculpture-of-near-naked-man-at-wellesley-has-its-critics/2014/02/05/1e583dae-8e93-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html)?    The figures on domestic violence show that it is not a gendered problem, each gender is as likely to be the initiator or the perpetrator as the other, [advocacy on the other hand remains one-sided](http://www.theduluthmodel.org/).

BUT really all of that is off topic.  I agree and disagree with your points to various levels and I mean we can get into them if you want and to be honest I just put these weak rebuttals up not to show complete disagreement but to show its not a black and white issue.  

What I really wanted to know was if its ethical to decide on one's own what certain groups based on their skin color or gender should be forced to read and if its not just little bigoted to make that assumption.  First off, to what extent is it even ethical to group people off based on skin color or gender...and then assume you know their life experiences to the extent that you know theres no way they could know or be aware of this concept such as they must need to be exposed to it.  Some black people are more prone to sickle cell disease and they should be aware of it but thats about the nly example I would want to make.  How do you fare?
