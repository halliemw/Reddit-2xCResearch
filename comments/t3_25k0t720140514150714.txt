That after unprotected sex it's morning after pill ASAP or bust.  After those 72 hours you are out of luck.

Not true!  A copper IUD can be placed [up to five days](http://www.hhs.gov/opa/reproductive-health/contraception/emergency-contraception/) after unprotected sex as emergency contraception.  This method is less likely to fail than the morning after pill as well, even after a longer time between intercourse and treatment.
