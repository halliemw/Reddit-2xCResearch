If I had one, I would. But the OP talked about particular men who were making his niece uncomfortable.  I said that people who do that sort of thing are assholes. Because staring at people to the point of scaring them is rude. The OP says that his niece would be visibly scared and people would keep staring. Anyone who does this is an asshole, regardless of gender. I wonder why you're so defensive.
