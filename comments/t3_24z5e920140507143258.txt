If after 7 years you still feel like you lack experience, you might want to stop and ponder why. There's a syndrome called imposter syndrome that a lot women experience where they feel they got their job on looks or luck instead of merit.

If you feel like you're ready to move up and you're being overlooked for looking too young, try to dress a little more matronly and be a little more agressive in asking for projects/taking the lead. Your bosses won't know you want a promotion until you tell them you want one. Don't expect them to seek you out.
