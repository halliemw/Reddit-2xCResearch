I got that as well. Attended high school freshman and half of sophmore year, I was very petite and figureless. One boy in particular was such a jerk to me. Fast forward to when I filled out, this same boy keeps glancing at me at a friends house. He comes over and says 'DesertDeity you look good bigger.' He obviously heard how terrible these words sounded and attempted to recover 'I mean you filled out, like you butt and stuff' I stared at him pitifully because that was bad. I knew what he meat but wow. He knew he stuck his foot in his mouth and apologized and left me.
