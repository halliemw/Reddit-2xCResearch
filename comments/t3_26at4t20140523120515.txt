I talk about this all the time. I work with all men. When I give a direction I'm bossy or pushy or nagging. A male coworker gives the same direction in the same manner and they crew gets moving. 

I had a moment if instant karma a few weeks back when we got a new manager. I work in water/sewer, I've been at this location for years. I know how pumps sound when they are about to blow. I walk into the pump room and instantly realize something is about to go horribly wrong. I tell the new manager to get back behind the door and before he can finish saying "don't be bossy" the valve blew and he was hit with raw sewage in the mouth. Had he just tucked behind the door with me he wouldn't have other peoples poop in his mouth but NooOOoOOOo I'm bossy. Oh well.
