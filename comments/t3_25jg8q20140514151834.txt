I had the same thing happening to me when I was wearing scrubs and at a larger weight. It was frustrating cause the cute/comfortable ones are not too cheap! I found the higher quality ones would last a bit longer, but as other posters said, other than putting patches or double layering them where they rub, the only thing that helped me was losing weight.   
Due to the way I walk even though I think I'm fairly fit, my jeans still eventually give out in that area because it still rubs a bit.   
The more durable scrubs I found were ones that had a bit stiffer material. Not as comfortable, but lasted longer.
