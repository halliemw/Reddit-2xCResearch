I thank you for the advice, but I am not comfortable with an open relationship. I have tried this before with a ex-boyfriend and despite the best efforts, the situation devolved into a disaster. Maybe we just didn't do it right, but I wouldn't want to chance it with my current boyfriend. I don't think my issue is about my need to have sex with different people, I think it's more about my own sex drive needing a jump start to bring it back to life. I say that because not only has the frequency of our sex times dropped but also the amount of times I masturbate has dropped. This makes me think that the problem is more with me than it is with my need for sex.
