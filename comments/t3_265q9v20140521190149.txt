oh, i think your suggestion is perfectly reasonable. i've read a few other articles on this subject, and some of them suggest statements way more graphic than that, which is what causes me discomfort. i don't think that going on about orgasms, sex toys, the g-spot, etc. is acceptable until late childhood at the earliest.

and i absolutely agree that this mindset would allow for more of a focus on LGBT-related sex issues (though sadly, that probably won't happen anytime soon for political reasons...), but i still think further elaboration should wait until a kid can fully understand sex and all of its complexities instead of just the physical aspect of it.
