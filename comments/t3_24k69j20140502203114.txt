When I feel that way, I try my best to get in the shower, put on fresh clothes, and go somewhere around other people. When I was going through tough times and felt very alone I would do things like go to the book store and browse for an hour, or go read at a coffee shop, take walks, and make things. Write. Try to use my imagination. Sew something. It helps to make lists and not think to hard about anything you want to try - just try it. I don't know if it helps, these things just help me feel un-stuck I guess.

I hope you feel better soon, sending hugs :)
