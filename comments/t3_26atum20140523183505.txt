My NYC pedestrian skills have taught me well.  Today walking to work in another non-nyc city.  This penis car was being a dick while I had the right-away and another guy was standing on the corner.  He almost hit the other guy and was sitting smack in the middle of the cross walk.  I know yelling won't get his attention...he'll get pissed.  So I started clapping to announce my presence...and we was like oooh there is a person there my bad.
