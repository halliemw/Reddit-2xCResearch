I was forced to leave my ex-fiance due to his actions. What he did was something I would have never been able to get over had I staid with him. I was in the same place you are now. I lost an entire future that I wanted so badly with a man who I thought I would always be with. 

It's been 3 year now and after much healing and sorrow I am now in a loving relationship with my now fiance with a baby on the way. 

What I'm trying to say is... it will suck for a while but things happen for a reason as corny as that may sound it is very true... things will get much better and you will find a new future. 

hugs!!
