Yes, Feminism is inherently one-sided, but that in and of itself isn't a bad thing, IMO. It was born that way out of necessity, of course.  I don't think as a movement Feminism should or even needs to address equality grievances for men, that's not its purpose.

Of course I don't think feminism should be automatically opposed to addressing such grievances, either. It's unfortunately true that for either side specific individuals or groups sometimes adopt a base "us vs. them" mentality. Is that the mindset you see as "aggressive feminism" or is it something else?
