Public service announcement:  Unlike breast cancer, ovarian cancer is rarely caught early.  Pap smears do not test for ovarian cancer.  

Because of this, knowing your genetic risk is crucial.  Unfortunately, ovarian cancer was highly taboo in the past. If your grandma died from "stomach cancer" or an unnamed ladyparts cancer, please know that you may have a genetic risk and should consider getting tested for BRCA1/2. 

If you experience these symptoms for more than 2 weeks, get to a doctor and insist on a screening for ovarian cancer: 
* bloating/feeling of fullness 
* feeling full rapidly
* persistent need to pee
* increased belly size, looking pregnant. 

Also, rock on Angelina!  She made a wise (and typical) choice for a women with BRCA+.
