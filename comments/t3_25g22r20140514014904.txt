Actually I just read in I think a Gladwell book (the guy from outliers, I don't remember what this book was called but it had several short stories in it. Title was something about a dog I think...) how certain research shows that the fact that we have our period so often is a bad thing...

Evolution would have us pregnant or breastfeeding a lot more often, from a younger age and therefor we would have a lot less periods in a life time. I think, but don't quote me on that, it may even prevent some sort of cancers.

Google it, it was an interesting read!
