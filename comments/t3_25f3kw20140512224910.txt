It's very likely a hormonal reaction, could be the Oxytocin, mixed with frustration from not being able to come. 

A few questions: are you able to climax on your own? is there any clitoral stimulation during the session, or is it just PIV? How much foreplay do you have before you have sex? Are you able to come from anything else like oral or fingering? 

I ask because this could just be a situational thing, one that could be solved with a little bit of effort.
