Exactly. He keeps complaining that she didn't care about his desires as if there would have been a way for them to meet in the middle, but there isn't. You can't tell somebody who doesn't want to be friends with you to just be friends with you a little bit because you "need" it. It's like if one person wants to have sex and the other person doesn't. When two people disagree like that, the person who makes the decision is the one who desires *not* to do something. The person who wants sex doesn't get to argue that they have a right for their needs to be met.
