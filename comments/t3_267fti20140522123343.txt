I don't know if it's like that in the US or wherever you are, but here in Quebec it actually sparked heated debates. If it was really a choice THEY made, they probably would have no problem removing it for federal/legal pictures (drivers' permit, passports). Yet, there was an OUTRAGE and they protested to pass laws that would allow them *to cover their head on legally important identity pictures for what is supposed to be a pretty head accessory that they "chose to wear"*.
