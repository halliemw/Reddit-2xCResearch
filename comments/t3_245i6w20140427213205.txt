I have a niece like your daughter. Positives according to her: people will think you're older than you are (you can hang out with older kids and not feel weird and people will take you more seriously), you're naturally thinner (weight is spread out over a longer frame), your legs naturally look great, easier to get older boyfriends because they aren't so much taller than you, people will not try to push you around (you only have to deal with mean words instead of mean words and assault from jerky kids), you can wear high school and college-sized cool clothes and look great in them.  Also, tall people are subconsciously viewed as threatening, so if she chooses to be very nice, people will react with happiness and gratitude.  Tall people also make more money and are put in positions of management more frequently. There are tumblrs devoted to tall girls talking about how they are happy being tall girls. She can find those places to feel more "normal."
