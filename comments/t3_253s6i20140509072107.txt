I'm a judgemental baby lover.* I think you're awesome. If you don't want to deal with pregnancy and birth and babies, it's the responsible decision to make things so you don't have to. 


*I love babies and I judge people who sneeze into their hands and then without washing or sanitising grab door handles, press call buttons, handle money and do other germ-spreading shit like that. I don't judge people for their reproductive choices aside from giving affirmation when I feel like it.
