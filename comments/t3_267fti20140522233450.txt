Why not? Go ahead, they will probably appreciate it. Imagine somebody complimented you on your haircut or your choice of clothing, wouldn't you feel flattered by it? 

I openly admit I have an almost unhealthy fascination with African hair and especially intricate braids and cornrows, so when I see people of African descent with nice hair I tend to stare. I try not to, but I just cannot help it. I quickly learned to give compliments on the hair to the people or my staring would get misinterpreted.
