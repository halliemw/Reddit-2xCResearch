Cranberry juice. And I'm not talking about the ocean spray cocktail with sugar, I'm talking about the unsweetened mouth puckering rap cranberry juice. Will help flush out if it is a UTI.

Also, try going to your local planned parenthood (they will do this for free if you are low income and have no healthcare) and getting the mirena IUD. I have endocrapiosis as well, this is a miracle. I have my period maybe once every 3-6 months, (Sometimes I'll spot, but not more than a day or so and it so light I just need a panty liner) my endo cramps are only affecting me 3-6 times a year, and I used to get them twice a month, It's birth control for 5 years, and if you are pregnant, it's actually used as an early abortion technique. you won't feel anything but a pinch when they put it in, and you don't have to take a pill or anything for 5 years. If you decide you want to start a family, you just take that out. No weight gain, no emotional craziness, just security, less pain, and fewer periods.
