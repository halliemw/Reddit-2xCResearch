My mom is strongly advising me not to get the Depo Provera shot or an IUD because we're receiving something that our body produces and eventually will stop producing. Wouldn't that hold true to the pill then too?She and my doctor believe that there aren't enough long term studies on the shot and an IUD has been linked to infertility. Are these myths? Do contraceptives stop working after years? The Depo shot didn't work well for her. She said she bled for 6 months straight. Although that's scary, I know not all contraceptives work the same for everybody. Depo Provera seems to be the route I want to go but I don't know how to let her persuade her into letting me at least try it. Any tips?
