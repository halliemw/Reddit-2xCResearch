I think that it's too easy for people to think that they would not care if they were in a woman's situation in many cases like these.  
But i have no doubt that my defenses would get whittled down one by one until i was so sick of it i could kill the next person that said something remotely sexist.  
It's unfortunate how some people lack empathy / common courtesy.
