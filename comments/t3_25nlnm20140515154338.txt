There are a number of other options besides pills available to you. The patch, nuva ring, depo shot (which I dont recommend) arm implant, two types of hormonal IUD and the non hormonal copper IUD. 

Starting on hormones will probably mess with your system for a few months while your body gets used to it regardless of what type you get on. If you keep stopping using them after two days, your body will never get past that initial phase. 

Talk to your gyno though on which options are the best for you. any advice here can't trump the advice of a licensed professional.
