They make those changes because people who are shorter don't just have shorter arms and legs. They have shorter torsos and smaller bone structure in general. For example, my mom is 5'1". A misses size 4 fits her hips and often her inseam depending on length and shoes, but if it's supposed to be a mid rise pair of pants, the waist of the pants which should hit the top of her hips actually reaches her belly button, but because it's designed to reach the top of her hips, it's too wide to fit her natural waist. If she wears a dress or a v-neck top from misses, the waist is too low and the v is much deeper than it should be because it's designed for a longer torso. Some day I should make her try on things with me (5'6") and take pictures to illustrate the reason that petite sizes are made entirely differently, because many people don't seem to know. So if you're someone who is very short, like OP or my mom, you will likely find that petite sizing fits you much better. Some things don't matter as much, like t shirts and sweatshirts and sweaters.

That said, a size 16 is more or less the same width in petites and misses, give or take a size because women's sizing is inconsistent anyway. A woman at our church is roughly my mom's height but at least 100 pounds heavier, and she also wears petites because the inseam length, the cut of the rise and the location of the waists all fit her better and are more flattering for her. My point was that petite sizes aren't just for people who are petite overall. They're for people who are short, no matter how much they weigh.
