My cramping lasted longer than the dr told me it would, at the time I was working a physically demandingish job and I wasn't up to speed (lifting ~40 lbs above my head several times a day) for a week or ten days or so. But the "ow, holy shit!" cramps turned into plain old "ouchies, not fun" cramps after 3-4 days.
