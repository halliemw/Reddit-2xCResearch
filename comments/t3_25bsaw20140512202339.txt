Thank you very much for this.  I have been slowly reading through all of these responses and I had read through yours (and others) a few times.  Just now, in reading this again, you speak about something being broken inside him and he would periodically say that exact phrase, "I feel like something inside me is broken".  He would also mention how he felt like a broken toy that nobody wanted.  I never knew how to respond to that other than to hold him and tell him how much I loved him.  It breaks my heart thinking about it all over again.
I am sorry for your loss as well.  To be honest, getting into a car and driving until I cannot drive anymore, where no one can find me, sounds amazing.  I just want to run away.
