i can't imagine what it was like losing her so young and then facing such trouble afterwards, it sounds like she raised a strong girl. I lost my mum in march this year, and i'm 22 yet it still feels like the hardest time in the world thats never going to end. I wish i could have something written from her, i keep looking at her old shopping lists like their great messages of love. mothers day has a whole new meaning now, and it's like we're in a big club of those who no longer have someone to mummy them. i hope you found some comfort in what she left you, and i'm so sorry for your loss xxx
