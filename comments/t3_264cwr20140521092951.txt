He's an asshole.  I'm sure he's just joking, and I enjoy the occasional stereotypical joke like any other guy, but there's some things that are off limits.  Talking about sleeping with other women is one of those in my book.  If it hurts you tell him it's off limits.  If he doesn't respect that then he doesn't respect you enough.  There's certain things over the years my wife and I have decided we wont talk about - and jokes we wont make.  It's just part of staying happy and healthy together.
