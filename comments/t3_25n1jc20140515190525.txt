It does still have that taboo feeling, doesn't it?

It does indeed change quite a number of small things - your vaginal ph changes, the stress of "yes? no? maybe? maybe now?", and I honestly hope pregnancy is kind on you as it can be absolute hell for some (migraines, dizziness, mental health goes a bit sideways). Knowing that your brain literally shrinks and then grows in a slightly different pattern after birth... 

My friend had reasonable sex ed but didn't realize that after birth it's not just "placenta gone, all done" ... it's "you know all those periods you skipped, have them ALL now".

On the practical side - you can get the test strips inside of pregnancy tests in bulk online on sites like Amazon, same with the ovulation ones. 

I'd start looking at the sites that challenge the "you have to have"s - you don't need to have a swinging crib, you don't need to have a thousand cute outfits (they rarely stay clean for more than a couple hours anyway), you don't have to have arch-supported shoes for a baby that won't be walking for a long time, etc.
