I know. She looks stunning and I look down and see stretch marks and stretched out skin making me look like a wrinkled shell is covering my abdomen. I haven't had a baby in over 13 years and I'm still wrecked. No bikini's and now I can't even wear shorts because of all the new spider veins and red spots. Very happy for her, more sad for me.
