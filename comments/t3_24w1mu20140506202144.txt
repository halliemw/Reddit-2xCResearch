Yeah I definitely know what you mean... I'm not sure I know the solution, though, as I'm still searching for something that drives and motivates me to feel completely fulfilled. I think that it's okay, though, not to have found that thing, yet. My hope is that an important part of life is the tough road to finding what makes you feel that way. As a side note, it's important to keep in mind that there's no one solution that fits everyone. Maybe thinking about why these typically "fulfilling" things don't cut it for you, can help you figure out what may actually fulfill you. I can't say I know for sure though...
