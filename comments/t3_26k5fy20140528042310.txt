I completely agree with this. I have a friend who is finishing up medical school currently and he posts all these horrible articles about the high suicide rates among physicians and how many med school graduates come out with PTSD from the stress of the program. I think it's horrible that the system does this to doctors. How can someone care for others if they can't care for themselves? 

The work life balance is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue my doctorate in occupational therapy rather then medicine. I want to have a life and while I love my career and I'd do anything to help improve the quality of life for my clients I can't do that if I don't care for myself first and foremost.
