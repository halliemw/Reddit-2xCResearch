LPT: Look for "mother's lounge" or something like that. Many malls have them and every Toys/Babies R Us or baby specific stores have them. They're intended for nursing mothers, but also have nice clean changing tables like a home nursery. Best place in the world to change a baby. If you're a dude, just knock first or ask an associate to check them to make sure there's not a lady in there nursing.
