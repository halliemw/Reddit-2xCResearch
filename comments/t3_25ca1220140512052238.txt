I had the same problems but wasn't getting any happy side effects of birth control. I just switched to a different generic brand that seems to help with my low sex drive. Just talk to your doctor if they are good then they should be willing to help you find a new one that is better for you. No one can tell you if you are going to have the same side effects of a drug as you will, everyone has different bodies.
