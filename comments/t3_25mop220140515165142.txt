>Depression is a chemical problem in the brain

Says who? Serotonin theory of depression is discredited. It might make it easier for a depressed person to accept there is something wrong if they believe it's like appendicitis, but it isn't. For most people depression is due to life experience and circumstantial factors. Don't let niceness get in the way of reality.
