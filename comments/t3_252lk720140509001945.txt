Excuse me, but that's not true in Iran. At least not currently. You can't be imprisoned for taking off your Rusari for a moment. If that were true, I would be in jail by now.

Now if you were to go out into the streets without wearing your montoe (jacket covering arms) AND your rusari, yeah, you're gonna get in trouble. But the act of enforcing rusaris ARE NOT at all that strict anymore. 

Yes the country is living currently under Sharia law, but under the new president things have gotten so much better. It's not at all that bad. Now you might get a couple of looks if you wear your Rusari super loose, but you get looked at in AMERICA if a woman wears something that someone might not agree with. 

By spreading these notions that women get LASHED for something as a rusari enforcement, you're actually spreading lies to those who don't know the country and in a way empowering the Revolutionary Guards and dress-code police though fear. By no means am I saying the country is swell. Horrifically so, stoning still DOES happen (very few, but that's still horrible) as do public executions. Progress is being made, albeit slowly. 

(edit: grammar.)

**TL;DR: NO, women aren't given lashes for not wearing a Rusari. At most you get a warning, and a ticket. Source, Iranian-American living in Iran at the moment.**
