Best advice I can give someone that will soon be married....Learn very quickly that your SO can not read minds. Learning this lesson will help in every aspect of your marriage.

They do not know what you want done.
They do not know how you want it done.
They do not know the time frame in which you want it done.

Communication is the key to a long and happy marriage. It should not be a burden to ask, to explain, or communicate regarding your home, finances, or sex.

Again...people do not read minds, to expect that they should is setting yourself up for failure.
