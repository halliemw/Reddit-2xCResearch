Yeah, I have trouble relating to OP there unless she is talking about opening pickle jars or something but usually you can work around that by prying the lid off or using hot water.   I honestly do think that sometimes trans people can experience a bit of a placebo effect that makes them feel gender differences more strongly than most cis people do.  There was a FtM guy on TAL a while back and he just reported a bunch of things that seemed impossible to be caused solely by hormonal changes, like being more interested in physics and becoming sexually aroused by sports cars.
