This is an excellent point. I was in a very abusive relationship for 5 years and one if his "rules" was that he has to know about all of my plans that didn't include him every single time. If any of my plans changed without me telling him, I was obviously lying, and if I was lying that meant I must be cheating(because what other reason would I have to lie about something -his logic) and since I was "cheating" it was his job to "put me in my place" by smacking me around just a little so I would learn my lesson. I had a friend who picked up what was going on and confronted the both of us. I paid for that one. My bf thought I had told my friend I was being abused. I was beat because I was lying about my bf beating me. I tried to explain why his logic made no sense, and he explained that "it's not considered abuse because I made him angry in the first place."
