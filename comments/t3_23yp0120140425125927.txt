None at all. I met a woman a few months ago who has been dancing poi for 10+ years. She told me she was teaching a beginners class that started the next week, and even though it was something I've never done before or ever thought I would do, I decided to try it. Why not right?

Now I'm so in love with it. One of the best things I've ever done for myself.
