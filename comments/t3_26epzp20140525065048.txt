While I agree that it's worse for women, the exact same thing happens to men in many ways. Don't wear that. Keep your hair this way. Keep your facial hair that way. In extremes you need to groom your chest hair and back (because women want the right amount of hair) and then of course, if you're shorter than the woman you're just doomed. 



I'd also say that there's a lot of pressure to constantly check one's self and their behavior, as a man. Acting however you want, as a woman, as basically become synonymous with "independence" (not saying this is the case for every woman, but there are those who hide behind it) and has led to a number of unapologetic woman who feel entitled to whatever they want. Now this is my opinion, but I feel that it's the opposite for men and that we are being taught that we are generally the guilty ones in any altercation between a man and a woman (and even potentially guilty when it comes to dealing with children).



Anyway, I could go on and on but I'm making less and less sense... Ha... I'm up at night with a pretty high fever, in my defense. In any case, my point is that both genders are guilty of putting double standards on the other, and turning it into a dick measuring contest is only putting us further back. I imagine that some men that choose to hate feminism do so because they feel that feminists aren't trying to address gender equality on all issues - only the ones that concern women... And feminism is supposed to be about gender equality, as it's core... Yet the professor who motivates this woman only cited issues relating to women.
