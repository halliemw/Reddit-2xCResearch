Yeah, made me sick, but it didn't surprise me... I've posted my fair share of progress pics too (last year and before that) and got plenty of nasty responses. Still get weird comments on completely unrelated threads sometimes, like "you're a fat cow" or whatever ingenious insult the troll could come up with at that particular moment. Doesn't really phase me anymore, but it's sad that it just keeps happening. 

But: /r/loseit rocks! Amazing community and great people. I finally went back there last week after a pretty shitty year (weightloss-wise and some other stuff), and it's been great. Congrats on your amazing progress!
