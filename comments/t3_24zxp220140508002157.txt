To answer your first question: I support it. From a previous comment I made:

I am personally happy to have a female-oriented subreddit as a default. Its nice to see ladies represented on the Internet. How many times has someone responded to you on reddit and referred to you as "he" or "him?" Let's help fight the "there are no girls on the Internet" stereotype!

I haven't viewed this place as a secret girls-only treehouse for some time. The people who like to brigade and post casual sexist nonsense or otherwise troll already do so. In my opinion, out of all the female-gendered subreddits, this is probably the best one to be defaulted (leave my trollx alone!).

I think an interesting experiment would be to make an /r/gender (which there already is, actually), or otherwise gender-neutral subreddit for the discussion of gender and see which gender dominates in the default. Would women or third-gender related things be downvoted or pushed aside for a male dominated argument? Or would it be fairly balanced?
