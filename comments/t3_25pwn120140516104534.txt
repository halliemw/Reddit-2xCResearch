I go to the same school as this brave woman, and this isn't an issue at just Columbia, it's an issue that's plaguing college campuses, but to hear a visceral and real first hand account is jarring. It shows an incredible amount of strength and courage to be able to share a story like this, and I wanted to share it so that other survivors could come out the woodwork and attack sexual assault on college campuses together. I feel sickened that I go to the same school as rapists, but I know that many do the same unknowingly.
