I totally feel your pain. I had someone say that to me while I was bar tending.  It was a table of two regulars who had the same thing each time. I asked them what they wanted and instead of the usual "gin and tonic and wings" I got asked "so have you noticed that you've put on a lot of weight recently?"

I was so dumbfounded, I'm pretty sure my jaw was hanging open. When I said "pardon me?" The jack ass actually repeated himself. The first thing that came to mind was "go fuck yourself." 

Sorry for the rant, his comment to you brought up some feelings. I hope you can move forward from this and know that you are a wonderful person inside and out, regardless of someone's personal opinion (which according to my mother, are never in good taste)
