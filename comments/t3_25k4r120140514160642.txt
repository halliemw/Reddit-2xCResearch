I don't know if this helps, but I willfully became a single mother in my 20s, similar situation. Because God really wanted to teach me some humility, I had twins. Today, those kids are 16 and I will be the first to admit that I wish I'd waited until I was more stable and grown up. I love my boys but I really wish I'd been a better mother, which is a hard thing to do so young. If you want to have kids and be a good mother, my admittedly bossy advice is that you take the best care of yourself that you can, and that includes picking a good time, place and partner to has babies with.

If you do change your mind, you need to establish a support system early. You are going to need a lot of help, parenting is NOT something you can do alone. Parents, aunts/uncles, long-term friends, etc. You need a line up of a good dozen people, at least, and that is assuming you have healthy pregnancy.

Whatever you choose to do, know that your body is your own and you owe use of it to NO other people. If folks judge, that judgement is about them, not you, and you do not need to give any fucks about it.
