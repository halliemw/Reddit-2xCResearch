I got cat called today while walking to my final exam, and I was actually thinking that I could use the example on reddit lol. Also, really drives home the point that women have shit to do other than be a sexual object for strange men. 

Most of the times, people don't compliment you. Today, I got obnoxious kissing sounds when the person walked past me. I've gotten whistles and then just grumbles along the lines of "I want to fuck you" mostly from men twice or maybe even three times my age. The closest thing to a compliment is  "so hot" and that's just muttered as I walk by or shouted at me (the muttering is super creepy and the shouting is humiliating). Only once time ever did a guy  tell me (approaching me and speaking like a normal person) that he thought I was pretty and asked for my number. I don't consider that street harassment/cat calling. Another old guy came up to me at a grocery store and told me I was pretty once and then left, and that was a huge self esteem booster. But strange men yelling/muttering shit at me has never made me feel good.
