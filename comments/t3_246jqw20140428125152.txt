This...  No, you say it once and you do it.  Do not bargain with yourself.  

I never worked out until my late 20's.  Like, at all.  I had the time and managed to find sports I liked, which helped.  I realized that I felt much better after a workout, and feeling good feels, well, awesome.  

Take it easy when you start, if you go to a trainer, who can show you the ropes, tell them you just need the basics, and they'll show you how to exercise so you don't hurt yourself.  The problem with a trainer is that they give you some mad routine that you'll never, ever, want to do a couple times per week.  Intense, yes, fun, no.

Find a sport/activity you can do and that you like, and get involved with a gym but don't kill yourself.  Although, you may find later that you'll want to try ;-)
