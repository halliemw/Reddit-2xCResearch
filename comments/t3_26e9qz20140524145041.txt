Oh, OP, I wish I could reach through the internet and help you feel better. Have you tried therapy?  I ask as someone who's found it useful for depression/anxiety and who's gone through her fair share of panic attacks.

Is there any way you can avoid this meeting if it's not what's best for you?

Much love.
