I don't have any advice, but I sympathize with you. I've worked in customer service for six years. I actually really enjoy it, but some customers are just unfathomably weird. I've actually taken to intervening when I see it happening to an employee - I'll walk up, excuse my interruption, and tell the employee they have a call on "line 10" (doesn't exist!) which is code for "flee for your life!" :) 

Also, unrelated, but what the heck is a "knob-end"?!
