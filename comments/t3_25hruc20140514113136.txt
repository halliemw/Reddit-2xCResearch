I think with age there are new interests that men start to develop for women. They start becoming less interested in the young, fun girls and more interested in the sophisticated, fun women. I've noticed that a young woman who is trying to search for a marriage makes the relationship harder than a woman who is just going with the flow.
In all honesty... Be yourself. Everyone is beautiful, and interesting in their own ways. Someone is going to find you and end up really liking you. The odds of that are not slim either.
