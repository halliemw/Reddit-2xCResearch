This is why it scares me to see how many people will cry about the demonisation of male sexuality when we talk about the importance of stopping rape. I know they're a minority of the population, but there are still so many of them, and some of them are actually managing to convince some men that their sexuality is being maligned. Hopefully this just looks so bad because we're right in the middle of this stuff.
