I'm 6' too but I've never felt bad about it, rather proud, which I think stems from the fact that it was always treated as a positive asset by my family. My mom would compare me to my slightly older male cousin and predict that he would never catch up with me. When I was around 16 my dad said that he thought it was silly for tall women to try to hide their height by wearing flat shoes. I've tried to take it to heart and regularly wear heels. It does intimidate people at times, but I just don't give a crap and they tend to relax about it eventually. All my boyfriends have been a bit shorter but really the whole idea that the woman should be shorter than the man is biased nonsense anyway. 

My advice would be to encourage her to feel proud of her height and view it as a positive asset. Disencourage her from trying to hide it. Try never to make remarks that even slightly suggest she is too tall for something or she looks funny with shorter friends etc. Finally, long flared trousers with a tucked in shirt and a sleeveless cardigan is one look that I find works really well with my height.
