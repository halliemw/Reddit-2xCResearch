I don't think I'm judgemental at all. He did give a couple of examples of judgemental things I had said. But they were things that I had thought about a lot. I sit on the fence about a lot of things and struggle to form a strong opinion until I know lots about the subject. 

Some days I don't have to go out the house for anything, the weather's bad so I don't want to go out and everyone's busy so there's no one to talk to. I just revise, browse reddit and listen to music all day.

The only thing that's going well (but could be going better) that I also have to focus on is university.
