Try sticking a peeled clove of garlic into your vag. Within hours it relieves symptoms and after a day or two that overgrowth of yeast is taken care of. The only thing is you start to taste the garlic in your mouth, or at lease smell it, its pretty weird...(source: I used to date a guy with an uncircumcised penis and poor hygiene so I would get them frequently, but havnt had one in years now)
