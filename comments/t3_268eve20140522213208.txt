I don't think I can think of it as non-consensual sex.  From what he described, it seems like more than just short-term amnesia.  The things he said I was saying were completely uncharacteristic, which leads me to believe that my mind was in an altered state.  He also recognised that my behavior that night was very odd, comparing it to someone who was drunk or high.  I don't believe that I had the capacity to consent while my mind was in an altered state due to drugs, even prescription ones.  I'm not going to lose my friendship with him over it.  Even if he truly believed I was in a state of mind where I was fully able to consent, I don't think think that makes it consensual.  I'm not going to attack him or anything over it, mind you.  I do think it was a genuine mistake/misjudgement.
