I am a teacher and we recently banned leggings/yoga pants at our school unless they are worn under a long shirt or dress. I spoke to some of the students about it and they argued that they wore leggings for comfort, which I can understand. But on the other hand, some of the girls were wearing leggings/yoga pants that were so tight we could actually see . . . outlines. Of labia. 

But I think the primary problem some of the girls had with this new policy is that administration almost arbitrarily enforced it. I know this for a fact. There are certain girls who would be able to get away with it, while others would not (it didn't really have anything to do with body type, just the favoritism). And there were certain guys who would wear short shorts and wouldn't get in trouble.
