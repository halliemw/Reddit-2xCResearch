It's a one-post account. They don't speak for this subreddit because they're not even willing to speak from their real account and not a throwaway. I'm sorry they're using shitting on you to troll us and make us look like buttholes.

As for you, your thoughtful comments and you are welcome here, and you might want to consider looking into asexual communities. I've seen a number of them online.
