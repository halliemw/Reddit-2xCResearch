I really don't want to pry, but who is providing financially for your family right now? If the bulk is on your husband, I would bet that he is kind of waiting for you to come into the work world and help him. I think there is a real rational fear with a more "serious" tattoo (I think that sleeves are scrutinized a little more in the professional setting than a single tattoo would be) that you will have a harder time landing a job. I bet that this fear is leaking through, he did not/does not expect to be the sole provider for the family and is taken aback by the suggestion that you do something to your body that might cause him to have to be. This is completely me just spitballing, but it's my gut reaction.

I think that's where the personal issue comes in. I know you already have tattoos, but as others have said, maybe in his own mind they are not as dramatic or inappropriate as a sleeve might be.

I think honestly just talk to him without getting angry. Just listen to his side and ask that he is completely honest. Of course it is your body, so you have the right, but he also has the right to have a personal issue with it (even if you already have tattoos).
