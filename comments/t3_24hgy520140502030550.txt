Oh, it was definitely inside, properly sealed with no blood leaking... the works! But either the Diva Cup is too long for my vagina, or it just doesn't work with my anatomy, but each time I wore it, it would press against my urethra from the inside (behind it??). Because of this, I would have to stick a finger in and press it away from the spot it was pressing again because I wouldn't be able to fully pee otherwise!
