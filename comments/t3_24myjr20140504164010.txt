When I'm feeling really irrational levels of anger or sadness, just looking at the calendar and remembering "oh yeah.. my period is in 4 days." makes it a little better. But mostly I just yell at my SO, cry, eat (this is my favorite part and usually calms me down enough to do the next step in the cycle), apologize, watch movies I like, accomplish something at work, and sleep. Repeat that for like a week.
