Thanks for the advice! I plan on telling him this. The only thing I worry about is that I am pretty confident that when I say that I just don't feel a connection, he is going to ask "Why?" and tell me he will change, etc. That is where I get awkward and don't know how to respond. Any advice on ways to end the conversation quickly?
