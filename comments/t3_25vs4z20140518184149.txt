Forgive me, HawkeyeHanah, but I feel compelled to mediate here.  I don't think FreeCookies6 is trying to argue with you; rather, s/he is offering you a perspective that allows you agency, which is something you seem to be struggling with, although you haven't explicitly framed your troubles this way.

When one has been abused, teased, raped and otherwise mistreated as you have been (and as I have been), agency has been repeatedly denied.  How can we find our agency?  Because of the psychological torment we've been through, it can be extraordinarily difficult to even realize that agency is something we need and have lost, much less locate in the mental detritus created by our abusers.

I think FC6 is responding to that vibe in your post--s/he doesn't mean to be disagreeable.  I think s/he means to point out to you that pregnancy and childbirth aren't your biological inevitability or destiny, but *choices* you can make *freely*.

I think s/he means to empower you with the agency of being the *only person able* to make those choices for you and your potential future family.  

I, for one, applaud you for your soul searching (as I bet FC6 does, too).  I think you're doing tremendous work to heal.  And furthermore, it sounds like you *want* to be a mother, but your trauma interfered with your desire to mother.  

Good luck to you, and I send you all my best wishes for a fulfilling life full of mothering baby/ies!
