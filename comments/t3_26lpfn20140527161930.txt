Very true. Both my SO & I work full-time (hime over-time a lot) and go to school full-time and at the end of the day it's like we either go out to eat and come home to a dirty house, or spend time cleaning and cooking and going straight to bed with no free-time to relax. I get one day off a week and during that one day he expects me to have everything spotless and dinner ready by the time he gets home. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't...it sucks because it's like my only free day and I have to spend it working still on housework. I would happily stay at home and take care of the home though if it meant not working.
