You are not getting enough upvotes. Period. You've got the proper attitude. You've done more work than 99% of the population at achieving your goals and it has paid off. Personally, bodies are stupid. We're all trapped in one and it is very rarely the one we would choose. So, it is important to accept that some things about us we can change (which you've done a fabulous job at), others... we'll have to accept.
