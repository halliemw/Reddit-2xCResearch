I think people are becoming more understanding. I've read before that cases of sexual abuse by parents were hugely controversial, as no one believed that so many parents (specifically upper class ones like themselves) were child molesters. I think a lot of ignorance will be lifted as gender roles get eroded away as well, they probably contribute a lot to people thinking women are incapable of abuse. 

The problem is that you're looking back on your actions as a child with the mind of an adult. What you did seems terrible, because now you know it's bad. It's obviously not as serious, but plenty of perfectly normal adults stole things and bit people as children, because they didn't know it was wrong, or didn't fully understand what they were doing. In a weird way the fact that you have guilt means that you shouldn't, because you know what happened was wrong and won't do it again. 

Haven't received closure yet, but I'm working towards it. I hope the same for you.
