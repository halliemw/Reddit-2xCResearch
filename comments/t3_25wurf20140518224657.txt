I could have written this a few years ago. 

I'll tell you how I made friends after a lifetime of driving people away for unknown reasons. I just kept trying until I found the people who "get" me. Totally not what you wanted to hear, I know. I still continue to drive people away. But a very few people stick around. And they're totally worth it.
