As a graduating senior, this resonates with me a lot. My school is actually famous for its activism, but almost all of that is symbolic or students finding themselves at best, and resume building at worst. Our campus is racially diverse but does not come close to reflecting the demographic reality of where I live. Rape and sexual assault also happen on a regular basis here and go unpunished by the university. There is such a widespread feelgood attitude perpetuated at my school, and even students in my liberal arts departments who claim to be down for a cause are really just hugging orphans and then going back to their nice hotels. I feel this on such a deep level because I transferred from a community college and saw so much more radical thought and direct action coming out of there than I ever did at my university, and I was always told it would be the opposite. I am so ready to be out of this university where people talk a big game about social change but aren't even willing to change themselves.
