Have you ever seen someone "freeze"?  When something so unexpected happens and you're trying to process it, it's totally common to freeze.  I can see this happening easily.  A block's worth of "freeze".  A block's worth of "does he know he's touching my ass?  Maybe he's too drunk to know." And then a block's worth of "what do I do?  how do I handle this?" Because handling it will cause a scene.  You weigh up all possible outcomes.  Will your boyfriend beat this guy?  Will the groper turn violent with you?  What is everyone else around you going to do?

Not to mention you're considering all this while fuzzy headed drunk.
