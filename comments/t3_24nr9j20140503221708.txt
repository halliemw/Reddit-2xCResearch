I'm a 30 year old guy, but I've been in your shoes twice before. Once when I was 28 and just last week actually. You gotta keep yourself busy. I recommend doing anything that doesn't remind you of him too much. Do things that benefit your future. You say you're going for a masters, so you have a pretty solid focus point I'd say.  I feel you though.  My recent relationship that just ended has got me extremely down in the dumps and I understand how hard it is to move on, especially when there is another person in the picture with them.  Time will heal of course.  I had to shoot a wedding today and the bride and groom damn near mirrored the way my recent ex and I acted with eachother (in a good way of course).  That shit was so taxing on my emotions all day that I slipped out of my professional attitude and became visibly depressed.  I snapped out of it and put my fake smile and energy back on though.  Hang in there, it gets better.
