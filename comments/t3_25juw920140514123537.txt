No, you're not an awful person.  Being a caregiver is incredibly taxing, but something a lot of caregivers fail to realize is that *they need love too*.  They get so focused on never leaving the side of the person they're caring for, they stop taking care of themselves and that can be really detrimental to their own health.  

My mom was my dad's caregiver for most of their marriage, as he was very sick.  She was with him until the end, when he passed away from cancer.  We occasionally had to drag her out of the house for some time away, and it made a world of difference for her.  It's not always easy for the caregiver to admit they need a break, but it's HEALTHY for them to get a break.    

Talk to him.  You understand.  You have your own obligations in your kids, and he has his obligations to his mom (which is fantastic - that's *very* hard and what a good guy to do this!!!), but you guys are both people, too.  You exist outside of these obligations.

Figure out a time when you two, and ONLY you two, can get alone time.  Date nights that are more than 2-3 hours.  A long weekend alone.  Whatever works.  Fit it into the schedule and take that time for yourselves.  He needs a break, and you need to have a little more one-on-one time with him.  

So no.  You're not being a jerk.  This is just a really delicate situation and you guys need to talk about it, and figure out what works for you both.  Compromise!
