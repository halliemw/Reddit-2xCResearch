Say two equally highly qualified and skilled applicants apply for ten jobs. They are absolutely identical except one is black and one is white. The black applicant is accepted for two posts, while the white applicant is accepted for four. Is it not clear that the black applicant has less freedom, and reduced opportunity? They have only half as many options as the white person.
