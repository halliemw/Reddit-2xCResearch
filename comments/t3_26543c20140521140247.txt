Unless this guy has mental problems, a simple "That is making her uncomfortable, stop doing that." should suffice. Barring any mental issues I'm pretty sure this guy knows exactly what he's doing and if I were in charge he'd be fired on the spot, if that were the case.

That being said, it's ridiculous that you have to explain why you don't like having uninvited ass slaps and harassment, but can't you just explain to them that it makes you feel threatened and unsafe? Those two feelings alone should be enough to get them to pay attention and take some action, right? 

edit: and when we feel unsafe in a place where we're supposed to feel safe, like a workplace, that's humiliating, yes? Feeling threatened and as a result unable to perform your assigned tasks like normal is an issue they should pay attention to as well, maybe tell them that?
