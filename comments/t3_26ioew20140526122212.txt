Wow! Thankyou all so much, i've read through everyones responses and I really am grateful! I'm sure this will really help others in my position too! Wow, wow, wow, honestly... thanks! 

Well, I was hoping to ask another question, considering how much of you have helped me - well, i don't really feel i can be who i am with my friends without being judged. I want to be weird and wear what I want and do things in life that I feel they'd frown upon (like acting. They think its silly). I love them all, though, honestly I do - they're great friends, but... I can't truly be myself. What should I do? I don't want to lose them. Am I worrying too much?
