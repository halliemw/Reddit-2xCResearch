My dad died when I was 11, (I'm now 30) from a brain tumour. He was diagnosed when I was 5years old, and my parents were thankfully very open about everything so precious time was well spent and things weren't quite as scary as the unknown could have been. I am very close to my mum & I can't imagine how utterly shit its going to be when her time is up. It really scares me. I have only a few memories left of my dad, my little brother barely remembers him (he had only just turned 6; 3days prior to my dad dying). The thing about life & memories - why the hell do I need to remember stupid things like what I was wearing on a first date a zillion years ago with someone I no longer even know but I can't even remember my own dad's voice? It's sucks :(
