Oh, look at you! You've figured everything out. There are a quarter of a million subscribers to this sub, and you've got them all pegged because nobody threw a fit at the presence of a phrase that could easily be intended as tongue-in-cheek self-deprecating humor.

You must be a world-class social analyst, because you're just putting everybody else to shame. I've never seen a competent person even attempt to do such a thing, but here you've shown us all that, not only can it be done, but it can be mastered.

You are an inspiration to humankind. Thank you for your contribution.
