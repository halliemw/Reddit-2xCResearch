hey, that doesn't sound too bad!  So basically you wash your hair with sulfate free conditioner instead of shampoo, find a sulfate free oil for your hair, and ask your hair dresser to recommended sulfate free styling products?  I would think Argan oil that's pure has no sulfates in it though no?  It's very expensive though - I wonder if almond oil or something would work
