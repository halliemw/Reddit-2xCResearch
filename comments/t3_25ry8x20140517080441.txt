There are a TON of reasons this can happen.

* Stress / depression (it's not always something you're aware of)

* Normal libido fluctuations

* Change of diet

* Birth control / other medication

* Something he's doing that is unconsciously turning you off

* You're bored of the same thing

* You aren't in love with him anymore

* You need to communicate with him more, talking about sex isn't always easy but it can be really beneficial!
