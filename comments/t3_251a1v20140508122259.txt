You aren't, and were never supposed to.

Minimum wage, so far as I am aware, is the sort of wage teenagers make when they get their first job at some random fast food place.

Adults are supposed to be making more, which is why the wage is so low.  The problem is the economy crashing put lots of people who would otherwise have better jobs back to where teenagers would be working.
