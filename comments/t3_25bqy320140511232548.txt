I lived in a building that was across the street from a 7/11 and I would walk over there at all hours of the night. I had a guy, driving, slow down to lean out the window and yell out "hey baby, nice rack". I ignored them and they floored the truck in my general direction. I can't believe it now, but I ignored that too. 

I don't think I even bothered to tell anyone about it, it was one of those things that just happened. How did it even become remotely acceptable that it happens so often...
