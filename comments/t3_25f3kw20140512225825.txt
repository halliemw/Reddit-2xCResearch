- I can climax on my own but it always involves clitoral stimulation of come sort
- During the session it's just PIV. I've been wanting to get a toy of some sort that we could use so that there is clitoral stimulation because just using fingers isn't really enough in the moment
- The amount of foreplay varies, but my boyfriend likes to perform oral as well as finger me. I have to admit that I'm not crazy about either - they both feel nice at the very beginning but then (for oral) the sensations diminish pretty rapidly and (for fingering) I tend to get sore
- I have never come from oral, and fingering is very off and on - but I haven't come from it in a long time
