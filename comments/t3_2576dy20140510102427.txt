You can get a female circumcision in clinics in Singapore and in Malaysia (probably other places as well), doctors fully endorse it and it drastically reduces the risks associated with this procedure.

You should also know that [doctors in the US used to practice female circumcisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#Europe_and_the_United_States) up until the 20th century.

>In the United States J. Marion Sims (1813–1883), regarded as the father of gynaecology – controversially so because of his experimental surgery on slaves – followed Brown's work, and in 1862 slit the neck of a woman's uterus and amputated her clitoris, "for the relief of the nervous or hysterical condition as recommended by Baker Brown," after she complained of period pain, convulsions and bladder problems. Sources differ as to when the last clitoridectomy was performed in the United States. G. J. Barker-Benfield writes that it continued until at least 1904 and perhaps into the 1920s. A 1985 paper in the Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey said it was performed into the 1960s to treat hysteria, erotomania and lesbianism.

Your story about the little boy's penis infection has nothing to do with circumcision. He was ashamed to talk about it and get treatment. If a girl is ashamed to talk about an UTI she gets, you wouldn't say "oh something should have been cut off of her to prevent it". This is just a very strong cultural bias from the doctor in question. If you have a UTI you take antiobiotics, girls are 4x more likely to get them than boys, if they don't go to the doctor when they get them they'll get in trouble as well.
