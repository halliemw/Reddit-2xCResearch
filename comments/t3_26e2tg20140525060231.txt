It's psych 101, to be honest. Psychological projection, and everyone does it, a lot. Women and men. Projecting your own fears and insecurities about yourself onto other people, which is exactly what this guy was doing. His insecurity is blatantly obvious, what with his constant need to praise himself. There is another recent model of the basic idea of projection called "thought suppression" which is thought to be an even more accurate model of the psychological process that is occurring. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_suppression

This stuff applies really well to the loud anti-gay religious preachers who get caught with gay prostitutes...
