I agree with that criticism. Somebody chooses to commit murder or assault. Deer running into the road, ice patches, etc are things that happen without human intervention and a lack of human intervention can sometimes lead them to be more dangerous, but it's not a social failing like people regularly choosing to commit violence for the same reason, when that reason is not a risk or harm to them and is perfectly legitimate for the other party to do, like women breaking up with them or denying them sex.
