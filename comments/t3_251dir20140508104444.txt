I hope you don't take this the wrong way, as I'm not sure of how much you've used Nair in the past, but whatever the formula, please, please, please do a patch test! I've got shiny white scars on my leg from various Nair patch tests, so something in my skin just doesn't agree with it. I'd hate to hear that you had complications before knowing just how your skin would react to it!
