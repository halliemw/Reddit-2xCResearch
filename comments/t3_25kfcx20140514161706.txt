I've been on Zoloft for a few years and never noticed any effect on my cycle. I feel like the only way to know if Zoloft is influencing your cycle would be to wait and see if this happens every month. It could be that your body is just adjusting to the new medication because everyone varies so much. If you're really concerned, obviously you should talk to your Dr., but I don't think you should be worried.
