This is going to sound so stupid, but one of the big reasons I don't leave the house is lack of clothes I feel good in.  I didn't bring much because I heard tales of the best shopping in the world in Italy, only to find that everything is full priced and not much better than in the US - unless I'm looking for runway fashion, which I am not.  I feel better admitting this, haha.  I suppose looking for second hand stores or bargin shopping is one thing I can do to leave the house. When I look good my self esteem is almost double.

Thanks for the tip on meetup - I will start scheduling things.  I feel worlds better when I leave the house, but that first step is so hard.  Taking a shower and getting dressed feels like such an ordeal, and I'm not even a high maintenance person.
