What to give depends a huge amount on the individual person.

If you want to give a gift (not everyone is into the whole "shower" thing), you might want to ask her mother, sister, or another close family member to help you screen some ideas. You can always pick something off the registry, or if you know her well enough to know that she doesn't really *need* a specific serving platter, you could give her something like a gift certificate for a massage or a gift card towards a new swimsuit to wear on her honeymoon. If you want the gift to be more for the couple (so more like what you'd give at a wedding than a bridal shower), then I'd go with something you can easily afford off the registry and maybe toss in something cute, cheap, and fun as well. A friend gave my husband and I a check along with a $5 book called "I Could Chew on This: And Other Poems by Dogs", and we giggled our way through the book which has resided on our coffee table ever since.
