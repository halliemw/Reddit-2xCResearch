yeah, the stickiness is definitely a problem, so I make sure to use it while in the bath/shower. it's quite manageable if you have warm water running, and you don't need to taste it if you don't want to.

I would say I use about equal parts honey and brown sugar, but feel free to adjust depending on how scrubby you want it.

If you want something for your lips, too, there's a chocolate-sugar scrub from lush that I like a lot.
