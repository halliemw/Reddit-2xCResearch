Alternatively, I'd say these are still good, and purposefully pointing these beginner classes at women gets women who have never done those types of things to learn, "hey, it really is easy to do!" Were the classes "how to use a pink hammer and a pink drill!" then I'd be with you, but anything that gets more women to break out of gender jail is useful, even if it has to conform to stereotypes to start with. Sometimes the wolf in sheep's clothing is useful.
