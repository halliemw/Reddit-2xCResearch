Hmm. I agree with you and everyone else regarding a food diary. I'm trying to figure out what all makes me bloat as well. I'm only 5'1, 105lbs - petite and slender. But when I bloat, I feel like a shapeless blob because of my short stature.I wear a lot of skirts that sit on my natural waist with shirts tucked in, making this issue even more annoying and uncomfortable. 


Do you chew a lot of gum or consume things with artificial sweetener? I do notice that when I chew sugar-free gum, I get extremely bloated. Note: chain chewer here, so almost a pack a day. I've cut back a lot on the gum and have added more probiotics to my diet (Amazing Grass - powder supplement, kimchee, kombucha, occasional greek yogurt). I also play around with intermittent fasting, but because of low blood sugar issues, not as extreme as most people. I try to stop eating after 7pm and don't eat again until 10 or 11am. I'm also trying to be more conscious of eating slowly and chewing my food more. I eat a lot of veggies, so the more I start the digestive process in my mouth, the better my stomach handles it.
