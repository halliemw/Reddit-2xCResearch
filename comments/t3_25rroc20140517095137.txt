I actually did worry a bit about that, because the context is kind of important. It's a relatively common sight/saying in Texas though. It's a message to state lawmakers, the basic idea being that we'll fight to keep control of what belongs to us. Here's a little bit about the history behind "Come and Take It": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_and_take_it#Texas_Revolution

Thanks for asking :)
