After reading your comments I think your rightfully annoyed and upset with the fact that he's responding so flippantly to your state of mourning.  Instead of being emotionally supportive to you, he's being selfish and willfully oblivious. Taking work off with that excuse and going to do something for himself is very frustrating. He not only acknowledges that being emotionally supportive to you is something he should be doing, but he leveraged that fact in his favor to get out of work and then did whatever he wanted. You can't be ignorant to someone's emotional needs and then also turn around and tell someone else it's a major responsibility of theirs. 


The conversation you need to have is about how he needs to be emotionally supportive. Whether you want to admit it or not, he's making the decision to not be empathetic. Maybe you both need to communicate better, but from what I've read this isn't new. I'd consider getting into therapy together.
