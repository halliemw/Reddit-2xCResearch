You have no responsibility and should feel no obligation to bear children. It is completely your choice, and having children does not make you any more or less of a woman.

As to your addressing your repressed memories - good for you! It's a long and difficult process to live a healthy and safe life after experiencing trauma. I know for me alcohol was a crutch to help me avoid how i was feeling. The drinking wasn't the problem, but the reason why I was drinking was. 

Facing your issues head on is a brave thing to do.
