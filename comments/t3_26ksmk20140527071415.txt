I started looking at the food pyramid a little more closely and realizing that I not only have to eat from all groups, I have to eat the right proportions of each group as well. That meant that I had to consciously eat more vegetables than I ate grain, which was a huge switch for me. It also meant that I didn't have to eat as much meat as I was, and that a lot of the nutrients contained in meat are also found in vegetables.

If I'm not mistaken, you can eat healthy at Subway too. Get the pita/flat bread option, no dressing (some olive oil if you want), one type or no meat, lots of veggies (the ALL THE VEGGIES option is really satisfying)

Another thing I do is to always have a fruit, bag of nuts, and/or tea bags in my bag, wherever I go. It makes me less inclined to buy a candy bar or milkshake or some sugary snack. Also, the constant presence of food gives me a choice of deciding whether or not to have a snack. 

Most importantly, I don't call it a diet. It is a lifestyle. Which also means that it's quite slowgoing, so it took at least 3 months before I started losing any weight. But I felt healthier almost immediately, which is my personal goal.
