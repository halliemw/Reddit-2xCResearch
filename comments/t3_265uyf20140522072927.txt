I have the Mirena, and the cramps were pretty bad for the first 3 weeks. They started to taper off after that, but they were intense for the first bit and didn't completely subside until about 6 months later. It never hurts to talk to the doctor about it, but be prepared that they may tell you this is the new normal for a couple of months.
