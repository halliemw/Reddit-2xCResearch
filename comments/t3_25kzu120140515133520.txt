I'd like to say that I don't think you're failing at life. You've obviously been through some really hard times and you're still here. Massive achievement right there. Not to mention being in school and having a job too. Try to remember these achievements when you're down. You certainly don't *need* a boyfriend. If it's something you want, it will come with time, allowing trust to build slowly. Certainly not something that can be forced, as the Supremes sang, 'You Can't Hurry Love'.
