We are very deliberately not giving an exact timeline.  

If we say something like  "things will be back to a baseline in a week" than we essentially guarantee that a week from now we will still be dealing with protest brigades and trolls.

We're keeping track of where our subreddit traffic and posters are coming from.  There is still a lot of noise directed from other subreddits, but we're seeing things improve gradually.
