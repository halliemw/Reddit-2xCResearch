I watched the clip of their date on r/videos and very much liked it. Then I made the mistake of going to the comments section. It's fucking tough being a fat girl. Someone in the comments asked why it seemed like fat girl was this woman's identity. I wanted to respond that when you are a fat girl, that's the first thing people notice about you, the defining characteristic in so many friendships and relationships, and the one thing you can not escape. As a fat teenager, I was a great friend to many teenage boys because I was technically a girl, but the boys had no interest in dating me, so it was like having a guy friend who knew how to help them with girls and could listen to their problems. I made many long-term, beautiful friendships half a lifetime ago, but I feel that if I had been a conventionally attractive teenager, the dynamics of these friendships would have been entirely different. Being a fat girl defines how everyone else reacts to you, so why wouldn't it be a defining characteristic in your perception of yourself? 

I am proud of who I am and what I have accomplished. I am a beautiful, self-assured, smart, talented woman. I am a fat woman, though. I like that the woman in the clip refused to let Louis C.K. ignore or dismiss that.
