Thank you!! 

I was shocked when I opened this thread and saw the first one calling her boyfriend a racist.

There are certain dangers and complications that come with working in an inner city school that you just don't have in suburbia. 

Two of my family members work in the Detroit area. Things they deal with daily include:
-student fights
-one got a horrible black eye from breaking up a fight (they are told not to for this reason but she genuinely feared for the other students life)
-young pregnancy. Youngest one experiences had just turned 13. 
-constantly absent parents
-illiteracy (in high school)
-no attendance 
-children who go without meals, hunger
-majority of class failing, and you still have to move them forward because the system makes you.
-one got all of his benefits temporarily cut off because the district ran out of money. 

One has recently left and gone to the next town over in a much more affluent "suburban" area. Her quality of life has increased exponentially. She used to dread going to work every day, it made her an awful cynical person. Now she loves what she does. Her daily problems now consistent of helicopter parents and kids with late homework. 

OP's partner has every right to be concerned. She is also able to make the final choice. There are many many teachers in my family, they all will tell you the first year is the hardest. Going in with all the cards stacked against you only makes it harder.
