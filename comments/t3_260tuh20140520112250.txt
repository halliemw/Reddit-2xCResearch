I'm pretty much in the same boat; although I haven't made much progress here are some nuggets of pseudowisdom for you:

1. Don't overestimate or underestimate what you expect to get from someone. Don't push yourself to feel something for someone; if you don't, then you don't. At the same time, don't just sit back and expect to be swept off your feet; put in your fair share of work.

2. Don't overthink or overstress the problem. Personally, I have always been a bit quick to nail problems about myself down as aromantic or asexual or whatever, when in reality it's most likely something simpler (although I don't mean to belittle those things). Make a consistent effort instead of trying to categorise your problems in order to put them down as beyond your control or not your fault.

Personally, my approach is just to focus on the people you do know instead of stressing over the ones you want to (or want to want to). So long as you can be happy with the way you interact with people, then relationships will happen by themselves. But hey I could be wrong :s
