*it sharted with him throwing a little food he was cutting.*

A physical reaction to a heated discussion is not appropriate, and neither anger nor pregnancy or hormones is an excuse..for men OR women.  I think it will do you good to get counseling and learn how to handle dissension and disagreement and even heated debates without resorting to physicality.
