new wife, new homeowner, and new romantic living situation for your 3 friends?

i wouldn't be deeply offended, these ladies sound like they are at normal life crossroads where their priorities are naturally going to be shifting toward themselves, their SO's, and their lives at home.  further it sounds like you're recently living nearer to them, so while they may have been used to making concrete plans with their out-of-town friend and following through, increasingly closeness and changing the dynamic of your friendship to more casual hang outs seems like a double whammy when they are probably all less focused on friendship itself at the moment.

whether or not these things SHOULD get in the way of friendship isn't really the issue, that depends on what your definition of a good friendship is, and that definition is different for everyone.  

the reality of the matter is these things often DO get in the way of friendship.  you don't need to ask yourself "should i feel this way or not?"  you need to realize that you DO feel a certain way about being blown off, your feelings are legitimate, and if you want to stop feeling the way that you do, it's time to find people who don't blow you off, probably individuals with more similar circumstances to you (such as other graduate students).  you don't have to break up with your old friends to find new ones.  just respect that everyone has their own priorities, and if you want to be a bigger priority in your friends' lives, find people who enjoy prioritizing friendship.
