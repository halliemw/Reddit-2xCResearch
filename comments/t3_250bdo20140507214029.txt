It's likely a combination of hormones and what you're eating. Try to identify what you've eaten the last two days when you feel the most bloated and cut out those foods for awhile to see if it makes a difference. For hormones - see if it happens certain times of your cycle more than others. I always get super bloated when I ovulate, so I know to anticipate it and such. 

If it's a chronic issue (always happens and is uncomfortable) talk to your GP :)
