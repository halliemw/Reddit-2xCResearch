I noticed a similar thing but in the opposite direction. For a while in engineering school I just figured engineers in general were a socially awkward bunch.

When I was read as a dude, people didn't talk over me as much and considered my opinions more. Which really surprised me. I had been one of those girls who was adamant about how progressive our program was (I may have even posted here about it in a thread about women in engineering, actually). Discovering how differently I was treated when people saw me as a guy and didn't realize I was born female was pretty disappointing, but also really interesting. It made me realize how much farther we have left to go, honestly.
