Many schools stress the importance of reporting sexual assualt through internal channels when you start going to college. Title IX dictates that colleges address sexual assaults internally and, in my limited experience of one school, they REALLY try to not present going to the police as an option. In some communities if it happens on campus the "real" police will not respond anyway (unless it is particularly violent).
