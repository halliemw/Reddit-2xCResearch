Drop him, no matter how drunk, high, incapacitated you should never hit your spouse (unless it's during sex and you two have a mutual agreement you like it rough). It is no excuse whatsoever, don't sit there and think of the good times just remember, this could happen again and if it does it could be worse. Get out while you still can. Good night.
