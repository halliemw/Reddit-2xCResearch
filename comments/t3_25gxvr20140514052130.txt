I know you're talking about the show, but once you get to see things from her perspective in the books, it becomes much easier to empathize with her (after all, she's a normal child who's been abused and traumatized and has been living with people who want to hurt her -- of course she can't just kick everyone's ass and leave). Even book readers don't know where the story's going next in the show, what with all the changes, but I'll bet she'll be an awesome adult once she matures a bit. Give Sansa a chance!
