Each therapist has a different approach. You can try a couple different ones out and see who you like. Obviously, it would be difficult to get him to do that if he's reluctant to go in the first place, but maybe you could offer to do some of the initial research, read reviews of different therapists/check websites, etc.

I wouldn't suggest doing that before talking it through with him, though. If he really doesn't want to see a therapist, he won't. And that's fine. Keep being his support, see how things go. Might get better, might not. If it doesn't get better, suggest seeing someone again.
