I actually agree with this and think Xander and Willow are stronger people and characters than Buffy.

Buffy is a super-hero.  She has super slayer strength and fighting vampires is her birthright.  Which is awesome and all, but over the entire series her character arc is disappointing.  She trades her kick-ass-ness for retreating into a shell that's distant and cold and doesn't acknowledge her own humanity much less the incredible support she gets from the scoobies.  

On the other hand, Willow starts off as an insecure, weak, normal person.  She goes out and finds stuff that makes her become powerful and she confronts danger long before she's got any of that really working for her.  Not only that, she overcomes a strong addiction to that power and finds a ground or a center that's just in being human and it hurts and and it's hard and she keeps going.  Xander is the guy that watches.  He's got absolutely nothing remarkable.  That makes him extraordinary when he keeps jumping into the fray considering how limited he really is.  That takes balls of steel.

Much as I love BtVS, overall I'm kind of struck how the lead in Alias is really what I'd consider a strong female character.  (Can't even remember her name but she's a better example.)  Shes tough and determined and she's extraordinarily good at what she does.  She's also human and she feels and she cries and she hurts and she's feminine.  Then she picks herself up and keeps going on.  She never sacrifices her humanity or femininity to be a complete bad-ass, which is something I felt Buffy did.  Alias girl is kind of a complete package.
