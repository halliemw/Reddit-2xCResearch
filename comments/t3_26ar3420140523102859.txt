There are definitely employers who won't smile on a large visible tattoo.  A half sleeve would probably be reasonably easy to cover in most professional settings, but it would involve a fair amount of watching what you wear and potentially being overheated etc.  Further, it's a reality, albeit a sad one, that a woman with a visible tattoo will likely be more scrutinized for it than a man.

That said there are plenty other employers who won't care.  It depends on the job, work environment and local culture.
