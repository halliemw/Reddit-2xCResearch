I was pretty comfortable with hookups and one night stands, but I think I realized that this (tinder) is not the approach I would normally even consider taking. Most of the hookups I've had recently have come from me not even knowing guys were into me or me searching for them, so that's definitely a big difference. 

But I definitely will and college will be great and things will be okay! Hahaha thank you, it was just a shitty feeling last night but I really appreciate this!
