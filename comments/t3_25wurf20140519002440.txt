If you are on the spectrum you don't realize you're not picking up on social queues in conversation. You're blind to them because the part of the brain that takes care of that automagically doesn't function properly. That combined with the possibility for reduced empathy can make for a bewildering social experience. We take a lot for granted that goes on behind the scenes in our brains. If it never worked for you, you don't even know what it's like to have it. Kind of like being color blind.

You may want to do is see if you can find someone that can observe you when you're interacting with other people. Or perhaps ask a family member if they think you're weird.
