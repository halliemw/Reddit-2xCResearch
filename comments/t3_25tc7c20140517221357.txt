I have a Galaxy S4 with [this wallet folio case](http://www.bearmotioncase.com/Bear-Motion-Premium-Folio-Case-for/M/B00BT9KSQ2.htm). It holds my ID and a couple of cards. I sometimes carry a purse, but often I just have this and my keys. 

I went from a small flip phone to this so it took some getting used to. I can carry it a coat pocket and even stick it into a jeans pocket in a pinch, but of the time I just carry it in hand the way you would a clutch. It was a little annoying at first, but I'm used to it now.

Edit: I think the S4 isn't much bigger than the S3; the screen size is larger, but the overall sizes are similar.
