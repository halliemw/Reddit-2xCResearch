funny the "textbook" defines sexual harrassment as:

Bullying or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.

In this case ...after she was finished working there.  He told her he had romantic feelings towards her.  Nothing sexual, no promise of rewards, no sexual favors requested.  Despite  the fact that this discussion has blown the ACTUAL actions out of all sense of proportion.  

The ACTION alone decides if its harassment.  If it wouldn't be harassment if he was 23 and looked like Brad Pitt, than it cant be worse because he is older and less attractive.

You cannot claim that anytime you don't like the person attracted to you that its sexual harassment.  There are many women in situations facing ACTUAL sexual harassment.  Its demeaning to them to use that term for something like this.
