Don't worry, that's pretty common. I couldn't get tampons to work right until high school (although I wasn't sexually active then). I never minded pads, but I wanted to wear tampons so I could go swimming. I complained to my mom and she ran and got me some, ah, "personal lubricant". Worked like a charm. After a while, I got used to them and didn't need the lube anymore.

*Edit: Now those cup things that are all the rage now, those I can't get to work right at all. I've given up on them.
