Though it is utterly ridiculous that you must explain to someone why you don't want to feel uncomfortable, or touched without explicit consent, sexual harassment is wrong because it abuses power.  When a boss tells to his employee (or a mother/father to a boy) "quit acting like a little girl", what they're saying is that being a man is better, he shouldn't want to be a girl.

In the professional environment is the same, the use of authority to embarrass you and make you do or accept things that you're not comfortable with, because he has the power and you don't, so if you want to keep your job, you better accept your fate. With the added offense that even when a co-worker (in this case a man) occupies the same position as yours, he still feels entitled to kiss you or spank your ass with a stick because he is a man, and therefore, superior to you, who's just a woman.  Remember the message given to the little boy that women have less worth? It comes at play here full force.  That is saying "I am the man around here, that's how men behave and you, women, should just accept it as your fate."  He is so to speak "putting you in your place."

Though it is helpful to keep in mind that women harass too, and the principle is the same: Either authoritative power  (I'm the boss), or seductive power (you better accept my advances, or I will presume you're gay), and that message is full circle back to what parents tell boys (don't act like a woman).  She would be saying "don't act gay (not masculine, cause to be a man is better / superior, etc).  The other thing to keep in mind is that, if talk doesn't solve it, most companies give you tools to deal with that, you don NOT have to be submitted to that and accept it under any circumstance.
