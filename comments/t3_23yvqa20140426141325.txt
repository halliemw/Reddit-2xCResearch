I realize that Pap tests are traumatizing for some people. My point was that reading the FDA statement, they still have to take a sample of cervical cells to do the DNA test (in fact they can take a sample and do the DNA test and a Pap smear with the same sample). 

It is not a blood draw or vulva swab. So it's still a pelvic exam with speculum - probably not much different experience from the traditional Pap. The advantage is that it gives information about the HPV strain present (if any are), and might mean fewer colposcopies for women who don't need them, and more immediate colposcopies in cases where the HPV is high risk.
