You will have sex that is magical (most likely) in your life. Whether that's the first time or not is not really all that important. I don't look back on my first time as much as I look back on the first time I was with my current partner, which WAS magical. You'll have as many first times as you want if you think this way.

I will say, it can be awkward but once you get past that awkwardness just focus on having a good time and expressing yourself. Go get em tiger!
