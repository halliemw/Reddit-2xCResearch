I have had this conversation with my guy friends and the girl friends and they said that the other girls are probably intimidated and jealous. I previously didnt get on with one of my closest friends girlfriends, however we are friends now and I asked her, she even said that she was jealous.. im not taking a high road or anything, i fully acknowlege that i am more than likely defensive and give off a bad vibe to girls. I accept that. But I dont understand why girls would be jealous or intimidated?
