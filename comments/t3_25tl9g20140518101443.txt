All I had to do was read #1 & the decision's made. Do not. You are under no obligation to invite this woman into your baby's life. You are also under no obligation to continue her existence in yours. And for all the people who scraem that you're taking away the baby's grandmother (or choice to have one)â€”really? Do you really think that, after reading #1 through #5, she's going to treat a defenseless baby any differently?

Cut this woman from your life. Period. You're going to have issues at the baby shower & beyond. Forever. *She is not going to change.*

His father should understand & be willing to meet you guys elsewhere from now on. If he does not understand, well, it's time for a "come to jesus" meeting.

edit: omfg I just read the entire thread. Get her out of your lives.
