Good luck with all of it. I take Wellbutrin too. Nothing worked until I was taking it to help me quit smoking-turned out it helped my depression. I'm TX too. Most insurance covers counseling but not psych except for med monitoring. The hard part is finding counselors who take insurance where I am. Meh. Good luck again.
