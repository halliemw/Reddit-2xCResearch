so you are mad at him for not being exclusive in a long distance relationship and were angry at him when he didn't contact you one day? i think for your own welfare you should maybe consider not getting in another long distance relationship. it sounds like you are a very affectionate person who really needs to feel cared for in very tangible ways. it may be that the internet and texts will just never fill the hole for you. you need someone you can see their face, can feel their embrace before you can really trust them. it sounds like you were clinging a little and that can be suffocating to guys. in a way you might have been emotionally abusing him as well. 

having someone who really is there for you, literally there for you, who can hold you, might bring you the comfort you desire. i don't think any amount of technology can make up for this. and it sounds like you have a history with some trust issues (which i totally empathize with). long distance relationships are unhealthy for anyone with trust issues, because you aren't there to verify or discount your fears, and those fears can run away with you. this will bring you discomfort even with the most loyal people, and your trust issues will either smother them or push them away. you need someone you can trust, and the only person you will trust is the one who you can look into their eyes, and feel their embrace. you have to feel the love, otherwise your fears will get the best of you.

good luck. i hope you feel better. i know life gets crazy.
