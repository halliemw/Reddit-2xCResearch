I completely agree that Mandy Boardman's rapist (her HUSBAND!) was not punished appropriately for the crime he committed. About the comment: the judge suggested that she "forgive her rapist". Why didn't her lawyer also claim that the judge had said this and made some motion, action, or claims against this judge for that comment?
