I live in ballet flats. For my favorite pair which are lined with fake leather, I wipe them out with a moist paper towel or antibacterial wipe every week or so. Gold bond powder helps a bit too. I also have some socks made for flats that are like a thin panty hose material that I got in the sock section at Target. They have to be replaced when the elastic wears out and they're not totally invisible with shoes on, but they're washable. 

I just tried a removable foam inserts that have thin terry cloth on the sole and are machine washable. This seems like the most promising method yet. Wore them all day yesterday and they kept me pretty cool. I can't remember the brand but they were also from target, found them on the end of a shoe aisle with other similar products for about $12.
