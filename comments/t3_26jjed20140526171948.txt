You can put [something like this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/2-in-1-Motion-Sensor-Alarm-and-Chime/28240654) in front of the window you like to keep open and if there is movement it will sound an alarm, you can turn the alarm off if you're awake and in the room.

You can place [these](http://www.walmart.com/ip/GE-45115-Wireless-Window-Alarms-2pk/16561504?action=product_interest&action_type=image&placement_id=irs_middle&strategy=PWVUB&visitor_id=78066702279&category=0%3A1072864%3A1068865%3A971281&client_guid=7c7d71e0-e058-4e9f-93e6-d7765dd71f15&config_id=0&parent_item_id=28240654&guid=8b55c90c-6bd9-496e-9deb-c359cbf598fa&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&findingMethod=p13n) on your windows and if they move out of position an alarm will go off.

Depending on the type of window you have you can place [these](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Ultra-46103-Aluminum-Sliding-Door-and-Window-Lock/19870075) on the inside sliding portion of your window allowing you to open the window enough to get some air but preventing the window from being opened any more then necessary. [Here's another kind](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Ultra-48002-Aluminum-Sliding-Patio-Door-and-Window-Lock/19870076).

If you use the alarms in conjunction with the sliding window locks it should give you plenty of warning in order to get to someplace safe (like a locked bathroom or a neighbors apartment) and call the cops.

A couple of passive things you can do is have a light on near any open windows (but have your shades/blinds closed so no one can look in) and have a radio or television on loud enough that it carries out the window.

Get some [pepper spray for self defense](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Sabre-Family-Value-Pack/29314295) (not mace as you are in an enclosed space) and keep a phone near you at all times. A warning about the pepper spray, it will affect you as well but to a much lesser degree than the assailant so you should test it in an open area (a park or parking lot) just so you know what to expect.
