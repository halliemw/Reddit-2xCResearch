None of your reaction is uncalled for or unrealistic. It's like saying some woman in a war torn country needs self esteem or hypnotism lessons because the bombs that explode every night make you jumpy and hyper alert and sad. Well, it's the appropriate response to that kind of stress. You keep being assaulted! Sexism isn't because of you, and you know this, but it still bothers you, because it should, because people are bothering you. It's not omnipresent it's semi-present, so you don't feel safe everywhere, because you are not safe everywhere! 

Personally, I really really really recommend the living shit out of a supportive Wing Chun or Judo class. Feeling more confident not just because you think you are "empowered" woo woo, but because you are literally more powerful and dangerous when you have been trained to defend yourself. 

I want you to know, I get exactly what you are saying about feeling demoralized by this shit. I often feel that way on Reddit, I find myself despairing of men. When I see how they allow or ignore or encourage sexism or harrassment or bullying, and it makes me hate men sometimes and I don't like that sensation. I love men. I love my husband. I do not want to feel this way. I know that not all men are that way, that's why I want to not let it get to me, but more importantly I wish to fuck that men, **average men**, the guy reading these words would get a sense that this is not an issue that does not pertain to him. That he's responsible for the behavior of other men, that when you are in a favored and protected group, there is a burden of ensuring you are not oppressing another person, that it should not be up to us, to constantly point out when they behave aggressively or dismissively or enable sociopathy, that they need to start recognizing it in *themselves* because most sexism is a problem of *self-perception* especially in relation to women. 

**[ Spoiler: And here I pitch my personal experience as pertains to martial arts, but feel free to skip if you are uninterested in what I have to say about that ]**

I never once used karate on a living person, but knowing that I could blind and maim a man made me kinder and more outgoing. I spoke softly and clearly, I signaled my intent, and I worked on framing things so that my prospective attacker understood he was in the wrong, and should reconsider. It was an enlightening bunch of discussions for all participants. 

At the time, my teacher was world famous, and he trained me in all forms, all options, of conflict resolution. He taught me of establishing distance, or shoving a person back, or merely applying pain, or numbing a limb, or holding, or incapacitating, or maiming, and even killing a person, with anything to hand, with my fists and feet and broken bottles, and when to do so and when to refrain from action.

When I knew that all that stood between him and not having a pulse, was my choices, I made better choices, I spoke more calmly, I was infinitely more patient, I made no threats, I spoke no unkind words, because I wasn't afraid of him, I was afraid *for* him. 

That's the headspace I recommend. Not because I am bloodthirsty, as I said I have never harmed a person, but because prioritizing your safety over anyone's social pressure, and having the means to enforce and select your comfort zone, is astonishing in how it changes you. It was the most powerfully sane thing I ever did for my mental health. It took years, it was a process, it was 100% worth the time.

**TL;DR: Find a man in martial arts who is sympathetic to women, he will gladly teach you. Never mind a freaking *therapist*, your mind is not the problem!**

**EDIT:** In my excitement to offer what worked for me, I missed the freaking point of not offering you solutions or self defense, and I went to town! But I'm leaving that part up, anyhow, maybe it'll benefit somebody who *does* want my advice.
