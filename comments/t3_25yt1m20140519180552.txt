My mom and I do things together that we have in common, but I don't view her in the same way as a friend. As I'm typing this, I'm realizing I may have a similar but opposite problem as you. My mom has been going through a bunch of family stuff and treats me like a confidant more than I'd like...especially since I almost never confide in her unless I need financial advice or something similarly not that personal. I need my parents to be there for me for love and rock hard support and the occasional kick in the pants. Friends are who I can learn with and do misguided things without judgement with. Family relationships fall all over one giant muddy gradient. If you want to be closer with your mom, work on it. But don't feel like you need to. There are plenty of us who aren't close with ours.
