You're right, I think if I was dressed properly, had a little more energy, and not had my pack, I probably would have enjoyed it. But I didn't know many of the guys in the pit, or how drunk they may have been. The two guys I kind of knew where very drunk, and tipsy. 

And you're right about the calm chat, I'm still kind of mad so I should relax a little before I bring it up.
