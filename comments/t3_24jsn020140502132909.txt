I don't see any specificity in the OP's post about the dress code, other than her observation that the code appears biased (although I find it hard to imagine there are many guys wearing short shorts, dresses, or having their bra straps exposed.  I do expect there are some select guys wearing sleeveless tanks, or showing their underwear, but I would expect any dress code worth its salt to address those issues as well).

However, I was responding to her assertion that "...the dress code was promoting rape culture, since it cited the distracting influence of female dress on boys".  That isn't rape culture.  That is human sexuality, writ large. That is teaching children (in SCHOOL) what is and is not appropriate for a learning environment.

She is right, however, that part of her job is "teaching and discussing appropriate socialization".  And that is what I wrote about; that society IS going to be distracted by revealing clothes, both on men and women (or "boys" and "girls" even), and that distraction isn't appropriate for school or most professional environments.

And, when the dress code is written to be gender neutral, I don't expect it will result in the ability to wear whatever they want.

I expect [this, or something similar](http://i.imgur.com/tXZbxVo.jpg) is the sign the OP is talking about.
