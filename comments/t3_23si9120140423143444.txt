What's a tea house? A cafe? I'd probably go with a knee length/just above knee skirt and a modest (i.e. not low cut) top/cardigan. Make sure your nails and hair are neat. 

Since you're in high-school, they'll understand that you don't have previous work experience. They'll probably ask about your availability etc, why you'd like to work for them. Just try to be friendly, polite, 'bubbly' - sell yourself! Talk about being a quick learner,  you can multi-task, you're dependable/responsible etc.
