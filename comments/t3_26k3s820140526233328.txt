> that it's difficult to show the problems that women face in society without something causing those problems, and men often feel like they're being blamed. 

I've heard this explained a couple of ways.  The most common is "that's the way men think."  But I think some women think in blame-currency as well and are always looking for it.  I was certainly raised with a lot of blaming and it takes a long time to get off the blame soapbox.

I don't know how many times I've been interested in just the facts or in a feeling, and instead, the conversation got into blame.  

I agree that people who are activists of any kind need to start with common language, and get "blame" out of the way.

My favorite "feminist" teacher was the one who refused to cut men out of the picture.  The analysis had to be whole.
