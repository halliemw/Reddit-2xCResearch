Going to agree with the person who called the bridal shower a "gift giving party."
Also, consider the following:

1. Your friend might not have a lot of money, and needs to work.  College is EXPENSIVE, and if her sister's graduation was out of town, it may have cost her a bunch of money that she doesn't have to begin with. 

2. Your friend probably works a shitty job, but it is also a job that depends on her being there, and if not, finding some else to take her shift.  This is not always easy, and could possibly look very very bad-- especially if her job is something she will continue on in after college, or her job is working for a prof who will write her grad school recs.

3. I bet living with you and your friends was cheaper than wherever she is living now (unless it is with mom or dad).  Again, she probably really needs the money.

4. Your friend has had drama with people in the bridal party.  Where this might not be a jack and jill shower and the best-man ex might not be there, there might be less drama if you give her a pass not to show up for the small events-- and this is one.
