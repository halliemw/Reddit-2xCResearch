You're not a hussy, and your friend sounds kind of mean. :( Sorry that happened to you.

The worst one I've gotten was some dude driving by me while I was walking home. He leans out of his window and screams "WHO LET *YOU* OUT OF THE HOUSE, YOU LITTLE SLUT?!" and then proceeded to drive away. Others have followed me home and my neighbors at the time called me a stupid cocktease for riding my bike by in a tank top.
