Every time this has happened to me it was seriously upsetting and made me FAR less happy the entire day. It's been used to hit on me in bars/clubs too, and almost always I'm just thinking. Who the hell has an expression of :D while wondering where they parked their car or trying to remember the last time they ate? Ugh.
