It's the exact reason I don't crowdsurf. When I was a kid going to shows at 14 I would see that kind of stuff happen all the time, and if a girl even thought about wearing a skirt she'd come back all poked and prodded by all sorts of strange hands and fingers. So many people don't realize how common it is.
