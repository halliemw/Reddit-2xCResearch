The thing about the Bechdel test is that it only makes sense as a global measurement, and has very little power to pass judgement on individual movies. 

You could have a movie along the veins of Cast Away or 127 Hours where a woman is alone for 95% of the movie just trying to survive and come to terms with basic parts of human nature, and it wouldn't pass the Bechdel test because there's no one else there.

Similarly, I'm not going to bash movies like Saving Private Ryan because its setting and its themes don't lend themselves to woman-woman conversation. And that's fine! Not every movie needs to pass!

The point of the Bechdel test is to point how how crazy it is that, overall, on a large scale, so few movies actually do accomplish this relatively small feat.

EDIT: Passing the Bechdel test similarly doesn't mean you've got a great, thoughtful gender equal / feminist movie. Snakes on a Plane and Barbie movies pass the Bechdel test. You can talk about shoes, babies, weddings, tanning, all of which are things that are not specific men, but are also not all there is to life as a woman.
