FWIW, my personal experience with the PUA community is the exact opposite. Sure, there are some creeps in there, and it was a really gross place fifteen years ago. But the current state of the movement is one that encourages honesty, outcome independence, respectfulness, and positivity, as opposed to the canned routines or promises of  success of yesteryear.

Before finding the community, a lot of the guys in there have no idea how to talk to people at all, let alone how to have a positive interaction with women.

*edit:* I realize I'm in a minority here for having a non-negative view of PUA culture, but I'm curious as to whether the downvotes here indicate disagreement on sentimental grounds or if there's some discourse to be had on the subject. I'm open-minded with regards to this issue, and would happily reexamine my own views if invited to do so by someone similarly open to views other than their own. If I'm wrong, I'd like to know why, either via PM or public comment here.
