Even words can be abusive, and emotional abuse is as legitimate an abuse as physical violence, but even more insidious because it's harder to pinpoint.  If he's taking his anger out on you and being cruel to you, reason or no reason, he's abusing you.  Why do you think it would be more harmful to you and your daughter for you to leave and find a happier life than it is for you to stay and constantly take his abuse?  How old is your daughter now?  What if he starts to levy the same abuse against her?  Can you imagine what those kinds of cutting comments will do to her self-esteem and her belief in herself?

I'm not saying that you're not taking good steps by contacting your priest, but remember too that religious counselors will often counsel against leaving an abusive partner because they think that divorce is sinful and a woman should defer to her husband.
