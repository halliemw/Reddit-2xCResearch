Well it just seems that women are called out WAY more than men for these things. I've (personally) never heard anything negative about Usher/Chris Brown as far as their music videos go. I've never heard anyone say, "Usher is totally degrading himself! He needs to put on a shirt, what a manwhore!" He's praised for it. Yet, people are so quick to call women whores/sluts/what have you if they get a little sexual in music videos.
