I just feel like the community has been thrown under the bus for the sake of a bunch of assholes who don't care about women's experiences. Now we'll be in permanent 'educating the men' mode instead of having community discussion as we used to. The downvote fluxes already are so ridiculous. The safe space is fucked and likely won't be coming back - anyone who posts about personal, private issues is now open to the REST OF REDDIT instead of a community. Ugh, jeez, I'm so angry about this. It spits in the face of what 2xC did best - women supporting women.

I hope you've managed to get an invite to one of the different female oriented subs that have been made in response to this BS, but they're just starting and don't have traction yet.
