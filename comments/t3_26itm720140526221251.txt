Some pills cause this to happen. I started taking the pill I'm on now about a year ago and I skip periods like, a lot. For the first few months I was convinced I was pregnant each and every time. Here's my advice: buy a pregnancy test the first two times this happens, if they're negative, save your anxiety, breath, and money on pee sticks next time around. Unless you haven't been taking your pill correctly.
