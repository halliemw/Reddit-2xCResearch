Like OP said, when it was first marketed, it was made to be as "friendly" as possible. There were already arguments afoot that it would make women suddenly drop their womanly housewifely duties and go on a shagging rampage! Hide yo husbands, hide yo sons! 
So it included the week for bleeding because that was more "natural". Many doctors don't mention it (my first few didn't) because it is pretty unsettling at first. No cramps, no bloating, no irritability, no period shits, nadda. Also no "early warning signs" of missed periods if you're afraid of being pregnant. 

A lot of my friends are on it, and they wouldn't dream of not having periods. They just like having them. (Though to my mind if you could get that hassle out of your life, why wouldn't you?) But to each their own. I still carry emergency pads and tampons with me, but I usually end up handing them out to females in need.
