My sister has a lot of medical problems, a lot of which manifested in high school. These problems caused her to be extremely underweight, even though she literally ate all the time. She always looked like a stick.

I didn't know this until many years later but she was heavily bullied and abused in high school *for being too thin*. Even though I "knew" that people are assholes no matter what already, I didn't really get it until I learned that about her life. It's so ridiculous.
