I think you're right. After I posted this, I had sort of gut feeling of "yes, I do want to have kids." Right now? Absolutely not. But 3-5 years? Maybe?  

I already know my husband will be awesome about helping out. He's already better at doing housework and chores than I am. I would absolutely continue working regardless (he would too), so childcare would definitely be part of the deal. 

Your attitude sounds like mine, so I'm super psyched to hear that there are others who aren't excited about other people's kids. I've been told I'm really good with them, but I don't go out of my way to hang out with kids and find little enjoyment in doing so. But, I can definitely imagine having an awesome time with my own.
