I never felt friendly towards my mom until very recently (I'm 31).  Then I was like "...why not?"  And I started to think about how she always thinks about us kids, makes time for us, and generally is just always there.  My moms a bit of an insecure person, so conversation before could be a little awkward because I was afraid I would say something wrong.  However now I just try to keep jn my mind whenever I'm with her how great I think she is and then I just tend to be nicer to her naturally!  Like, complementing her, write her a nice email for no reason, generally open up and be genuine about those positive feelings.  She is just so surprised and genuinely pleased!  She has opened up to me on a few things I know she'd never do before.  

Our relationship is awesome, I feel like she's one of my closest friends now.  Sounds lame but it's really great!  The tension that was there from teen years is gone now since we actually communicate in a genuine manner.  Obviously like with any friend there are little disagreements but that mutual respect is always there to fall back on.

Anyway OP I think if you want to be friends with your mom you really have to start by opening up.  Tell her you think she's awesome and you want to hang out more (if not using these words).  If you would rather not that's ok but that's how relationships start!  With vulnerability and genuine communication.
