Try sizing up (your complaints of pressure make me think your underwear is too small), different cuts, different materials (something with a stretchy blend). When I was your age I wore Victoria's Secret undies (I still wear the Pink lacebacks). I personally prefer the thinnest strip of fabric in the back. I wear them all the time when going out -- they're really comfortable. I dislike pantylines and the elastic around most panty leg openings make me itch!
