People have given really good tips already, just wanted to add my two cents based on my own experiences. Everyone is different so it may not all apply to you, but I feel like my relationship is much stronger having figured this stuff out.

1. Expect it to hurt for a little while, because you have had this person close to you for so long. Change is hard. It's even harder when there are lots of other things going on in your life too, and you will both probably be stressed by the change. I'm not saying this to scare you, just to emphasize that it's ***okay*** if you're doing everything right and things still suck for a while. That being said...

2. Pick up your own hobbies. For me, socializing helps a lot, but I saw below that you don't make friends easily. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try, but you can also pick up other hobbies. I game, craft, ***exercise*** (this is a huge one because it keeps your overall mood stable), have "girly days" where I do my nails while watching netflix... The goal is to be happy by yourself, because if you spend too much time being depressed about your relationship it'll eat away at it, because you guys need to make happy memories too even while you're not together.

3. Set up a Skype schedule based on how much you both need contact. If you both like to talk ***all*** the time I would still suggest not doing that, because you should both be spending time doing those other hobbies to work on yourselves. For me, I'm an extrovert and my SO is an introvert so we put an hour-long cap on our Skype calls so he doesn't get overwhelmed and I don't feel like he's the one choosing to end the call. I don't know what your relationship dynamic is like, but this is what works for us.

4. Have a Skype date night! Make some dinner, pour some wine, sit down to a video call, and watch something on Netflix/streaming site of your choice at the same time.

5. Do your best to enjoy your time apart as well as your time together. I used to be almost codependent, but now I take more time just for me and it's made me a happier person overall. I still love spending time with my SO and would do it more if I could, but every cloud has a silver lining and I'd rather see it that way than be depressed about not seeing each other as much.

6. Don't make texting an obligation, or you'll both feel like you're dating your phones instead of each other. My SO and I text each other throughout the day if we think of something to say, but we don't expect an immediate response and don't freak out if it doesn't happen. You ***should*** be busy enough in your day-to-day life that you can't text 24/7, IMO.

7. Don't treat the time in between visits and calls as limbo, just waiting to see/talk to each other again. This is a surefire way to ensure you're depressed and lonely. I know I keep repeating it, but for me the most important lesson was to learn to take care of myself through hobbies and things I genuinely enjoyed.

Long list but I hope some of it helps you! Good luck! LD is super hard but if you can make it work your relationship will be much stronger for it.
