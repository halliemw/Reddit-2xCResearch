Sorry for being unclear -- the lines on the breasts themselves are indeed compression from my clothing. I'm concerned about the lines on the nipples themselves. It's especially bad on the right nipple (3rd and 4th pictures), where it looks like someone carved across them... because someone did, of course. I wouldn't have done it if I knew I'd have noticeable scarring.
