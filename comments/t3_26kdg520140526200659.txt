Thanks for all the advice!
Yeah, I'm thinking that mom has some issues with her own looks.  She's a bit overweight, lost some but everything's kinda saggy. She won't wear a swimsuit anymore, and we have a pool.


I don't think money is the issue. My dad is a lawyer, makes OK money, but we hardly see him.


The problem is, I don't have any money!!  I don't work, I don't get an allowance, my parents just pay for what I need.  I could lie and say I need money for the movie, going out to eat with friends, whatever, but then I'd be lying, and I guess I'd feel bad about that.

OK, tell me straight up - if you do a bra "fitting" do the store women, like, grab your boobs and measure them?  That seems SO freaky - I could never let some strange woman do that, I think. Or do they measure you, like, through your clothes??  I might could handle that. Maybe.
