I think maybe the point being made is a little more general, like how society tend to view women's bodies as a public space. You know people feel entitled to comment on a women clothing choice, the way tabloids treat celebrity women with either disdain (if their plus size) or concern trolling thin women. 

I don't think the message is literal as much as a view of the pressure our culture puts on women.
