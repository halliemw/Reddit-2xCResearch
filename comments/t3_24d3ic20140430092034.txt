I think that you're making a sound decision, consulting a genetic counsellor. 

Members of my family are carriers of a genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis. If I wanted kids my partner would need to get tested. One carrier is fine. Two? Houston, we've got a problem. The Danish version of the NHS encourages such precautions, partly for humanitarian and, I suspect, monetary reasons. 

The reasons why you should be prohibited from extending similar care and consideration to your own health as to that of potential offspring is beyond me.
