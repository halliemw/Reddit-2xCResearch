I think the issue is that it is always assumed that the woman is wearing the wrong size. In another sub I frequent, a woman posted a picture of the lines her sports bra dug into her skin after a long workout. Instantly, the comments were about how it was the wrong size and she should go over to /r/ABraThatFits and how she'd be so much happier. 

There's also the factor of delivery. If you want to suggest a subreddit, ask first if the poster has had a fit problem for a while, if they have pain or discomfort, etc. Then suggest a resource. Immediately throwing out resources before figuring out what's going on is pointless. I've had to stop talking about finding affordable bras to fit my huge boobs simply because it is inevitable that someone will say "well you're probably wearing the wrong size, go to /r/ABraThatFits and check to be sure."
