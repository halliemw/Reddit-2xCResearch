Christian man here. God has a place in relationships, however it should not cause these kinds of conflicts. Religion is supposed to a part of the relationship,  not the end of it. The bible talks a bit about these things, such as how to have a healthy loving religious relationship.  I don't remember the passages of hand but a preacher could definitely tell you all of them easily and explain there meaning in a more modern sense. That said, my fiance is not as devout as I am, so I can relate,  but I don't force anything on her, just offer religious advice and the like. She has since discovered the power of prayer and is beginning to get more involved in her faith. My best advice would be to talk to a preacher about it(for her), be the best Christian he can be without being forceful or rude, which can be a problem for some Christians who have not received proper guidance in their faith. (for him) Hope that was helpful
