I had to draw a pretty big distinction over the in a relationship/not in a relationship aspect of the story. I was basically thinking, "This is what happened the last time a woman I deeply care about and have feelings for was mad at me for something I did with a different woman." I actually take a pretty dim view of someone who consciously *chose* to be in a relationship doing what the OP's boyfriend did. Then again, I do see a very firm line between *in* a relationship and *not*. Legalistic thinking I guess. 

What really did mine in was distance. I would swoop in every month, or every other month really, for a weekend during which we'd try to do everything a couple might do over the course of a much longer period, all around a college schedule. There was no time to just have lunch, go to class, see other people, and then meet up later in the day like a normal couple might. When we met, we went to different universities, already far away, and then when I graduated, I went back home, which was even farther. 

I've actually dealt with her being in a relationship with someone else before, but it was only a few months after I had met her and it's when I *realized* I had actual feelings for her. This one hurts a lot more. My biggest fear is of being powerless and there is basically nothing I can do in this situation short of wait to see what happens, which kills me in a small way every day when something tiny reminds me of her.
