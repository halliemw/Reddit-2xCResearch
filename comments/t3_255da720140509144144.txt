This article is bullshit.  OF COURSE people who enjoy and find fulfillment in a task they are forced to do with a majority of their waking hours are happier and less stressed.  This point completely elides that many people who would LIKE to find meaningful work cannot actually earn money or find open positions in their preferred fields.  So a lot of us give up, grab the job that will give us the best compensation for our abilities and efforts, and focus on having to work the least amount of our life as humanly possible.  

Production is inherently valuable.  WORK is not.  We have a society that is technologically and socially capable of allowing the concept of a "work week" to fade into the past- but we refuse to redefine productivity on a mass scale as anything but a warm body in a particular place for a set amount of time. 

We live in a society that could afford to automate a lot of low-paying jobs and meet the basic needs of every person regardless of whether or not they work- but we're so invested in this concept of "work makes people valuable" that we refuse to do so.  Few would argue that people don't have inherent worth and value if put to them in just that way, and yet we all support an economic system that says and enforces exactly the opposite.

Once I realized the system is fucked, and that this whole "chase your dream" shit is just a carrot to make me a slightly happier and more industrious cog than I would otherwise be, I gave up on the idea that work is anything but a scam.  So I work to inable the real, productive, and fulfilling part of my life; the part where I do the things I was actually born to do.
