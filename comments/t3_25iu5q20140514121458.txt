I think the issue pneumon was talking about was more along the lines of people who fight sexist norms in the Western world, refuse to say that stuff that happens in the Middle East is sexist and in extreme cases claim that criticizing it is offensive. And I think we should be critical of that approach.

Think about the Western world. Slut shaming is still a big part of our culture due to Judeo-Christian theology that women have to be virgins when they get married. It's extremely engrained in our society. When I first saw a feminist slut pride march on the news, I was appalled. Being a slut was just *wrong*. There didn't have to be  reason. But as the years went on I realized how problematic that way of thinking was. To say that a woman has to not have sex so she's ready for her man is beyond sexist. 

I don't really blame any woman who thinks she has to be a virgin until marriage since it's so engrained. But it's still something that's very clearly wrong. And it's something many of us have fought against. Just because it is  part of our culture doesn't mean it should be part of our culture.

Back to the Middle East, I understand women there are raised that way and I don't think any less of any woman because she wears a burqa. But forcing a woman to cover herself is based on the flawed and sexist logic that women have to cover themselves so they don't "compromise" men. It's based on the idea that men should control what we do with our bodies. 

So again, just because it's engrained doesn't mean we shouldn't criticize it.
