Hey from the UK! 

If a person with LDs committed another crime like murder, punching someone or robbery then it would be taken seriously and people would perceive them as a danger to society. This should be treated in the same way.

I'm dismayed that the librarian treated you that way. I would take her name and let someone know about her reaction. You can tell them that she rectified it immediately but you should make it clear that initially her reaction was unacceptable. If it had happened to another person and they hadn't prompted the librarian to do more, the way you did, then that could have been it for them. It's obvious she and possibly other librarians/people who work at the college need more training about how to handle this sort of situation.

Of course you're not meant to laugh this off. It's in no way "sweet". It's clear he was trying to push the boundaries and see how far he could get without being told off. He obviously knew what he was doing was wrong because he immediately apologised for what he did. This is someone who needs to learn "This is wrong. This is why it's wrong". Often this is the case for people without LDs too to fully understand the effect that they have on someone when they do this kind of thing. 

If the college doesn't respond quickly to this then I suggest you go to the police sooner rather than later. It's not about getting people in to trouble but about getting him to realise the consequences of his actions.
