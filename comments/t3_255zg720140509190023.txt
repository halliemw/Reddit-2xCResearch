The best advice I can give you is to get your finances/will/etc in order, make your end of life wishes very clear so your wife won't have to guess when the time comes, and talk to your kids about what's going to happen when you come to the end - prepare them as best as you can for the inevitable, and let them know that while you can't always be there physically, you will do your best to leave them pieces of you to cherish - be it letters, videos, belongings, clothes sprayed with your favorite cologne, anything. 
 
My father died of leukemia when I was 7, and both my parents wanted to avoid the truth of the situation - my father never told my mom what she should do with his ashes, never left my sister or me any letters, videos, etc that we could hold onto in later years and I always felt terribly sad about that. No one ever prepared me for the possibility of him dying, and when he did we all basically fell apart. Literally anything you give your kids will hold special meaning for them as adults, so I would put a box together for each of them with some of your favorite things, and aside from letters about what you hope for them, tell them about yourself - stories from when you were a kid, mundane details that they're bound to forget like your favorite color or how you take your coffee. My biggest regret is that I never got to know my dad as a person - I know things about him second hand from my mom and his family, but it's not the same as learning them from him.

Your wife should try and find a support group that centers to grief issues - she won't have to participate if she's not comfortable, but hearing from others going through the same thing could help open her up. Please feel free to PM me if you want further perspective - I'm getting a bit choked up, so I'm going to end it here!
