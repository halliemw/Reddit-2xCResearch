I'm not saying that counting calories is not a useful tool, I just don't think that it is really necessary at this age, developmentally. It's hard to get young girls to eat anything that's good for them, period. (Source: I was a young girl and ate way too much junk. But I'd bet the same would be true of boys at that age.) I just think it's extreme to teach young people that they need to be fixated on calories, rather than just enjoying well-prepared and healthy food and also getting regular, enjoyable physical activity. Yes we live in a world where there are many people who are overweight, but I don't think that the answer to that lies in teaching kids to be anal about calories, I think it lies in getting them off the couch and outside, and also in showing them what well-prepared healthy food actually tastes like. I work at a youth garden program and we do nutrition classes, I think if we tried to teach them calorie counting their eyes would glaze over, but they love eating stuff right out of the garden and making things like kale chips and veggie pizzas.
