>Who are you to think you are entitled to see my hair

While I see your point, psychologically, hair is incorporated into our brain processes when identifying a person.

If someone dramatically changes their hairstyle, it can make them difficult to recognize.

I understand wanting to be modest and comfortable, but I also know that it's important to be able to identify a person. I think it's also possible to find a compromise, though, since obviously people change their hairstyles after they've had their IDs taken.
