This sub was never an island isolated from the general population of reddit - look how many posts pre-default have the "all" linkflair. That's actually how I found this sub back in my first adventures into reddit. It's the nature of being in public online. 

I won't disregard anyone's experience, but I am genuinely confused when an instance of misogyny or a hate PM is supposedly evidence that the sub shouldn't be a default. Those experiences are not new to reddit, including this sub.
