First of all, it's kind of rude to come into a space where women are discussing something that many of them find bad, and telling them how you don't understand why and that you would like it. In circumstances where other people have experienced something and you have not, it might not be the best idea to completely ignore their experience in favor of your own idea of how it might be.

Cat calling is not complimenting. I love compliments! Catcalling is totally different. For one, in my experience it has nothing to do with how I look - I've gotten catcalls when I was bundled up in winter gear and when I was dressed up for a night out. The comments are never just "You look nice", they're generally of a sexual nature. I'm lucky, and I don't usually get the super vulgar ones. But when a drunk guy yells "Hey sexy!" at me at a bus stop at 2 in the morning and then continues to yell when I ignore him, I don't feel complimented. I feel angry and kind of scared. It doesn't make me feel good about myself. Every time I've been catcalled, it's been an instance of a man deciding that his desire to comment on my body outweighed anything else - the fact that I was busy, the fact that it could make me uncomfortable, the fact that maybe I don't really give a shit whether a stranger thinks I'm attractive or not. 

I love it when my boyfriend calls me sexy or grabs my ass. It's a total self-esteem booster. But it's completely different when a total stranger does it, and those situations *are* degrading and annoying to me, and many other women.
