I am an infertile woman. Last year, my nephew's mom had to go out of town for work, so we watched him over mother's day weekend. My nephew was bummed his mom was gone, so we tried to do lots of fun distracting things. We took him mini-golfing, where I got wished happy mother's day (my nephew and I resemble each other). 

We took him to the zoo next. They were handing out flowers to the moms. I was a little worried about assuming the role of his mom, so when they handed me one, I accepted it and said "Oh, but I'm not his mom." The guy looked at me and said "Are you a mom at all?" "No," I replied. And he literally ripped the flower out of my hands and said "Then I can't give you this."

That event was extremely traumatizing but we moved on and went out to dinner. At dinner they brought a free dessert with "Happy Mother's Day" written on it, just assuming that I was my nephew's mom again. Again, so there wasn't confusion with my nephew that I was trying to replace his mom, we explained to the waitress jokingly that I wasn't actually his mom. She rolled her eyes and looked annoyed and told me that I should have told her that I wasn't a mom before we sat down.

By the end of the day, I was a crying mess. Because clearly our society only gives a shit about people they assume to be moms. Those who have gone through hell and spent thousands of dollars trying to become moms are just annoyances to the general population.

Luckily my nephew (10 at the time) was more sensitive. He hugged me and told me that it didn't matter if I was a mom, that I was the best aunt in the world. Sniff.
