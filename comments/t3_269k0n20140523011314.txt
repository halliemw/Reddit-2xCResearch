Your comment should have stopped at your third sentence. 

How can you in one of your arguments claim there isn't enough information to determine that cyberbullying contributed to her death, and simultaneously blame her depression for her suicide (from the same evidence: what her family said about it)? Neither her family nor you can reasonably make that medical claim on her behalf without more evidence, which you don't have access to.

Further, the idea that depression is a straight path to suicide does a massive disservice to people who are experiencing continual harassment online and/or depression itself. It's almost like you're justifying piss poor behavior because it's actually the depression that influenced the suicide. Is it not possible a person's conscious decision to make life more unpleasant for someone else contributed to the depression that caused the suicide? 

As for reasons why she wouldn't want to report it.... U.S. law enforcement isn't exactly receptive to female complaints of this nature. Tell me, how do you expect U.S. law enforcement to prosecute anonymous users or trolls from abroad?
