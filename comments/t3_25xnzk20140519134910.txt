lol, Sorry. I'm at work and not paying much attention to usernames. 

But you're absolutely right, since there is no excuse for sexism in general. I'm not advocating lewdly drawn images and stereotypical women in comics. I'm just saying this is an avenue where outrage is a bit of an overreaction since its a market that started and still is geared toward men. 

But I have to disagree with you 100% about parents only being able to do so much and its that mentality that is hurting our future Generation. As a parent, I take full responsibility in what my children learn. No, you can't avoid negative exposure but you can still teach you kids to make good moral decisions despite what they see. The feminine beauty ideal is only going to affect those who aren't taught how to love themselves and how special and unique they are. Children only learn from the outside world if that's all they're exposed to. I was raised in the hood. about 85% of the people i grew up with are dead, in jail or Drug dealers. I was exposed to the same environment they were. Went to the same schools. Played at the same parks. Listened to the same music. Saw the same shady influences day after day. But my parents were determined to show me that there is better out there for me and that I never have to accept the situation I'm in. So if parents choose to make excuses and raise their kids half-ass then they have no one to blame but themselves.
