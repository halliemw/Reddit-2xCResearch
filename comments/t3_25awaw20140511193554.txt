Thanks for your response! Yes, there are so many factors involved. Unfortunately, after giving my report, the detective was unable to meet with the guy. He kept avoiding calls and said he had the flu after making an interview appointment. Eventually the detective gave up and there simply wasn't enough hard evidence to prosecute. I think I will check back with the police and see if there is anything new on this guy.
