Without going into the details of the whole procedure, I just wanna say the anesthesiologist for my procedure was the nicest person ever. We talked about Star Trek before I went under and afterwards when I was in the post-care area waking up, he even came and checked on me to see how I was feeling. 

The rest of the doctors and staff seemed cold by comparison, but this one person made the whole experience much more manageable. I was only 19 and really afraid, so it was nice to feel like someone was on my side.

I wish I could remember his name, so I could write a thank you letter all these years later. I will never forget his kindness.
