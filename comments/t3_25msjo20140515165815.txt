Well, dress in general isn't something most rapists go for as most rapes are committed by someone the victims knows and trusts. Most often a family member friend, aquaintance, or partner/former partner. I'd say it isn't seeming meek or demure that a rapist would necessarily go for, but the fact that most victims know their rapists is what makes it so hard to report. Well, that and opportunity. 

(not sure about downvotes. it's happening a lot lately.)
