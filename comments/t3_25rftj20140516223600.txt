I believe very strongly in feminism and also that men suffer greatly from our sexist and patriarchal society. I will fight to the end of the earth for gender equality and advocate specifically for men and women. However I don't like the MRA reddit group or believe it's compatible with supporting men or women's rights for a few reasons. 

First and foremost is that one of their leading activists, Warren Farrell who is linked in the side bar and frequently referenced believes most women who are raped are at fault for the rape. [He is a victim blamer](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/05/01/warren-farrell-on-date-rape-defending-the-indefensible/#more-11780) 

[He also blames women for men's inability to control themselves around them while simultaneously using a woman's butt to sell his book, missing the incredible irony](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/04/30/warren-farrell-men-are-oppressed-by-womens-butts/) 

But by far the biggest reason Warren Farrell is not a friend to women, men, or gender equality is this: 

>**"We have forgotten that before we began calling this date rape and date fraud, we called it exciting."**

[Here is another article that discusses this quote in context. It doesn't get prettier.](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2013/05/03/putting-warren-farrells-notorious-comments-on-exciting-date-rape-in-context/) 

Here are a few more excellent articles that articulate why the reddit MRA sub is a reactionary group that's in opposition to gender equality and clueless about historical and modern sexism and oppression.

[And here is a screenshot of the Reddit MRA group with a mod endorsed stickied post by a member of the extremely misogynistic, pro-rape group TheRedPill about the Men's Rights guru Warren Farrell.](http://i.imgur.com/wboDxAi.png) Underneath is a MRA who doesn't understand that consent can be revoked at any time and is outraged (their word, not mine) about an article that encourages women to constantly reassess if they want to continue to have sexual relations with someone. Below that is an MRA who can't find anything wrong with the sub.  

Such a group is no friend to gender equality.
