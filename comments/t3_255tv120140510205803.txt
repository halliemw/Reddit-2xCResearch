I wouldn't consider shouting to be abusive behaviour in itself, but shouting to scare someone certainly is.

Here is the most important thing to remember when you start to have relationships - if someone is repeatedly making you unhappy, leave and move on. It may be abuse, it may not be - it doesn't matter. Everyone messes up occasionally, everyone makes mistakes and has bad days and that's ok. Most people raise their voice occasionally when they feel very frustrated. What's not ok is repeatedly doing something to make your partner feel bad, or scared, or to hurt them, when you know the effect your actions or words are having.

Arguments are normal yes, but only if they are fairly constructive and not nasty. People in a healthy relationship don't hurt (physically or emotionally) each other on purpose.
