ThinkProgress, UpWorthy, Jezebel, Salon, Daily Kos, Alternet, PolicyMic, are some of the most biased sources out there. These sources are like the Fox News, The Blaze, Return Of Kings, etc. of the left; if you read too much of them they will rot your brain. OP needs to quit linking to such low quality biased journalism and needs to grab The Economist, Bloomberg, Der Spiegel, The Wall Street Journal, Foriegn Policy, etc. for a change.
