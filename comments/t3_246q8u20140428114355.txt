 try to see her in person and without him on a somewhat regular basis.

Try to talk to her on the phone, so you can hear her voice and don't bring up the relationship unless she does. if she thinks you don't like him and she is in the "make it work mode" she may distance herself from you.

 don't assume the distancing is all directly him, she may be convinced that it is what she wants too.
