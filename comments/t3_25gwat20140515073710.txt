Ive been raped by a friend and it was the same thought process for me. I was very drunk and at first was very confused but then just blanked out. Disassociated from what was happening. Looking back, i think i just went 'hes my friend, he cant be raping me. I must have consented at some point' and after just went through a really intense period of mistrust and self harm. I realised later that actually he wasnt my friend he was an incredibly narsasstic asshole who assumed that female interest meant sexual interest and took what he felt he was due. Im still fabulous and lord help any man who pushes himself on me without my permission! Im that girl at the club who shouts 'get your hand off my tit pervert!' It took me a long time to be confident again- but this guy is the problem. And maybe you should talk to your friend about this. You may well lose her as a friend since people do shoot the messenger- but it may be worth it to get her away from a predatory man. If hes done it to you he'll do it to someone else- if he hasn't already.
I lost my besty over my rape. I knew she liked him but she hadn't yet told me she lost her virginity to him the week before. She reacted in a less than ideal way to finding out he'd forced my cherry. Long term, the fact that she chose him over me made her a pretty shit friend. Hopefully you guys can get through it.
