Why do you say he's not a little educated on these issues?

Not sure what your experience is with adoption or foster care. Every adoption I've seen involved a loving home that wanted a baby very badly. My one experience with foster care involved a family who was in it for the money. The result was abuse, rape, and eventually a 16 year old girl's death.
