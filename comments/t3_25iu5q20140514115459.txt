Thank you :) I agree with you that it sucks that anyone has to feel like they need to cover up anything for the sake of someone else and especially that a shirtless man is just a dude while a shirtless woman is a slut, etc. That's unbelievably infuriating.   
  
And, no, I didn't downvote myself, but I'm not surprised if I do get some downvotes. It's not the most popular opinion, especially for TwoXChromosomes. I think it's a hard pill to swallow for any feminist that there isn't an easy solution to global sexism, I know it is for me. But I think that the reality is that the world is just too diverse for a one-size-fits-all approach to gender equality.
