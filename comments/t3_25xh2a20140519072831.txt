Guy here.... difficult as this is for another's taste but here goes.
lazy morning, segue to lazy sex (if its his birthday you're doing the work).  Cook breakfast.. you again.  BAcon sandwich, orange juice coffee.  Gentle stroll somewhere, coffee, bookshop spend ages choosing one book, buy it for him.  Sit somewhere, pub/bar, a few beers, newspaper, read paper cover to cover (quiet, quiet is good).

Movie... standard action flick, popcorn.  Home, steak, a little red wine, more sex, bed (say happy birthday!)

I'd love a day like that.  Good luck
