I've been using the NuvaRing for about two years and it has worked really well for me. 

It bypasses your digestive system completely so IBS (or any other digestive problems) should not interfere with its effectivity. My OBGYN warned me about it causing skin problems, but for me it didn't disrupt my skin at all, so it may at least be worth a shot. You also don't have to remember to take a pill once a day, but only to put a new ring in every 3 weeks and for many women, it does help with period flow/cramps, but not for me unfortunately. 

Basically, as long as you don't have a problem with stuffing a little plastic ring into your own vagina every month, it's a really nice alternative, I can really recommend it. 

I had once in my 2 years of using the NuvaRing a single bad side effect I was not warned about, and my OBGYN later called "completely normal for some women who use hormonal contraceptives", but it seems to only occur when you skip your period multiple times in a row by skipping the ring-free week.
