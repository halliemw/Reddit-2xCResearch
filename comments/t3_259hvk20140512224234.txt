Except the employer then doesn't have someone working for them for that amount of time. For most jobs employers can't hire suitable replacements for just 12 weeks, and even ones that can are bound to lose money in the process. Therapist's clients aren't going to want to talk to a different therapist for 12 weeks. The next best guy in the kitchen might not be able to make food as good or as make it as fast as the normal chef. A doctor that can't preform surgery for 12 weeks means that another doctor will be preforming the more urgent ones, possibly one with less experience, and surgery complications carry tons of legal issues for hospitals even when they are legal protected. These things all cost money.
