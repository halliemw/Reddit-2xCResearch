I have been hormone free for the past two years and I feel so much better.  I am way more in tune with my body.  I was on allesse for about two years and then mirena for another three.  When I need birth control again I will probably opt for a copper iud.  I just never felt right while on hormonal birth control.   I started taking it later in life though so maybe it will actually be the opposite for you.
