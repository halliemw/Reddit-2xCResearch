First you can stop with this overkill diagnosis of an Oedipus complex. Good grief. 

My step mother hated it too that I was a daddy's girl. 

In your post, you slap some absurd Freudian concept on her and then the rest is about you. 

If you feel she is being adversarial only to you, then you need to accept this relationship with her father and not interfere with it. That is the best thing you can do for her. 

Boys hide their emotions. So just because you are not experiencing anything doesn't mean they are ok with everything. 

If you really want a happy family, stop making it about you and make it about them. 

combined families always make the mistake that they think everyone should be treated equally. It is just the opposite, everyone wants to feel loved and special and not forgotten in the fray. 

If you want her trust and respect, encourage her relationship with her father. She is clinging to him out of adjustment.
