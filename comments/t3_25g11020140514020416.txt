overall women tend to spend more time raising children then men do. many studies show that parents (and more specifically mothers) tend to the needs and desires of daughters over sons. parents are more protective of their daughters, more supportive of their daughters, more empathic of their daughters, give more praise to their daughters. 

and at the end of the childhood the boys are tougher, they persevere more, they have practiced their entire life at putting other people ahead of themselves, of sacrificing their desires in order to perform more for someone else. they are better workers, they are better at getting things done, and they make fewer excuses for their mistakes. 

so when a lab needs a new technician they can generalize that boys will get the job done more consistently, and if they fail they will not make an excuse. and when they are criticized they will not make a fuss of it. 

if you want to change this, your message has to go to parents. and the message needs to be this. stop protecting your daughter. let her get beat on and picked on, let her get bruised up and skinned up. let her learn lessons the hard way. teach her to be tough, teach her to persevere. teach her that her wants and needs come secondary to her ability to perform. 

because girls will always be discriminated against so long as they fail to perform as well as boys in the same situation. and the only way to get them to perform better is to teach them to woman up, and perform.
