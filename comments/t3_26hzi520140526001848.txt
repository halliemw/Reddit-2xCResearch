It is never overreaction when it comes to your personal safety. What if you do happen to get mugged or worse and you listened to your friends. Better be safe than sorry. It sounds like you are referring to a contact stun gun rather than taser. You need permits to own and carry a taser, but the stun guns are useful as well. They won't really neutralize an attacker, but they cause more pain than anyone is going to want to mess with.

Also consider concealed carry if it is legal where you are going. It is by far the most effective method of protection, and even if you can't carry publicly, they are great for defending your house hold.
