I taught children on the spectrum as my career; there are a few options for getting children diagnosed if autism spectrum is suspected. In the U.S., you can contact the school district starting at two years of age requesting that they test your child and begin offering services. This is, in my opinion, the worst option because it's in their best interest to find someone inexpensive to assess your child, not necessarily the best person for the job. School assessments are often inadequate and sometimes biased toward suggesting less help for the child (to cost the school less). The better option in my opinion is to go to a child psychologist with experience in testing for autism.my opinion of the best option is to look for a multidisciplinary diagnostic team, which may include a pediatrician, speech therapist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, psychologist, and a preschool teacher. These teams can diagnose a range of developmental disabilities, and there's an advantage in having so many different perspectives all collaborating in one day. You can try calling your local children's hospital or a nearby school for developmentally disabled preschoolers; either should be able to give you referrals of places that do diagnostics in your area.
