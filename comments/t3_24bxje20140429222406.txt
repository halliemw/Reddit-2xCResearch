What day of your cycle were you on when you took plan B?

I took it twice. The first time, I was 19, and it was pretty late in my cycle (so after ovulation - about a week before my expected period). My period came on time.

The second time, I was 22 and I had unprotected sex *before* ovulation (it was the first day after my period). Plan B delays ovulation if you haven't ovulated yet. Boy did it delay mine ! My period was **2 weeks late**. 

Some women have their period early, it's really hard to tell. Just relax, buy a couple pregnancy tests if you want to, and don't think about it too hard (I know it's hard!)

Good luck !
