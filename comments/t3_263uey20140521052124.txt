She told him in a prior conversation that she ad no intention of having sex, ever, she told him if she was drunk and said yes it still meant, no. She trusted him, that was why she was so explicit. She said prior to the first instance she was unable to consent, unable to consent means no. I am assuming that means you would have sex with a comatose person because they were unable to say no and consider that perfectly acceptable.
