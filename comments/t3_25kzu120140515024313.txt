Most of the time when someone tells you that you *need* something, what they're really saying is that *they* need it, and they're baffled that somebody else could have different priorities than them. Whether it was meant out of spite or just thoughtlessness, (and it's probably the latter) don't let yourself feel judged by anyone whose advice comes from a place of insecurity instead of empathy.
