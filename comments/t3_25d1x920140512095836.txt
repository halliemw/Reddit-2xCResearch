Give up on her ! There is 3 kind of people you will meet in your life - People who cares and wants to be close to you , people who dont mind being your friend and people who doesnt give a f*** ! 
I think you understand which ones you should keep close and respect, however there is no need to try fixing some friendship which doesnt really exist. If you are happy with her and enjoy her company - keep on hanging around with her and so on , but don't get too attached and don't take her as a great friend until she shows the same attitude towards you.

Nothing lasts forever !
