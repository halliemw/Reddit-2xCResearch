Unfortunately, because this article conflated Riot's attack on player harassment in general with fighting the much more specific and targeted forms of harassment that women suffer from much more than men, this ends up being a somewhat reasonable response to the article.  

I'm not sure that Riot's work is a good analogy for the debate about online harassment faced by women, precisely because it open the door to this type of derailing objection.
