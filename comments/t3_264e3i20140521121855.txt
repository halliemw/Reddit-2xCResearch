It sounds like classic PCOS, and you should never be embarrassed to discuss your health issues or questions with your doctor. We all do something that isn't exactly taking good care of our bodies, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't get treatment when something goes wrong. In this case, if you have PCOS, the PCOS itself can contribute to obesity, meaning that while not taking care of yourself definitely doesn't help, the deck is stacked against you as long as your condition isn't being treated. Losing weight will help the symptoms, and treating the problem with the right birth control or something like Metformin can help you lose weight. 

This is also something you need to get diagnosed because there are a lot of things that it puts you at risk for. For example, you're at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea, which if you're also obese means you're pretty high risk for those even though you're young. Go see your doctor so that you can take care of yourself starting now. Delaying treatment because you haven't taken care of your body in the past is only keeping you from taking care of your body in the future.
