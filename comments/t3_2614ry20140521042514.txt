"Yeah that's totally wrong. There are less differences between men and women than people think. a lot of it is societal."

There is absolutely no evidence in the scientific world that supports that statement.

Maybe learn about human sexual dimorphism, and the multiple studies showing male and females are not just drastically different physically, but also mentally.
