> I got invited to a wedding shower and a wedding, got all the registration cards of where to buy gifts from, but with no reception invite this year.

I've gotten a Save the Date card and registration cards once and then no invite. I totally assumed that I would be invited and casually asked about it when meeting the bride for something else, and she stammered a lot and later sent me an email saying she never actually expected me to want to come to the wedding, and it was going to be really small, and the travel would probably be inconvenient for me, and uh..

I found it really strange. Why send the Save the Date then?
