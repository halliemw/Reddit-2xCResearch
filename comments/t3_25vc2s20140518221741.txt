I'm still just mediocre at car repair (yay YouTube). The first time I put oil in my first car, I made a funnel out of cardboard and put it down the dipstick. I told my coworker at the time why I was almost late to work, and she showed me where I was supposed to put it. Then told me about her first time putting oil in her car, in which she put the oil in an old fashioned ketchup bottle to get it down the dipstick tube.
