Well do you know for sure that his first thought wasn't sadness? His first action was about his kayak, but why are you so certain he wasn't sad first?

And even if his first thought was about getting the day off, why is that so awful? People's minds are pretty selfish in general and we work to overcome it. Just because the first thought was maybe a selfish thought doesn't mean he's fatally selfish. If he's caring for your needs and being a compassionate person overall, I think it's ok that his brain went somewhere selfish.
