I'm afraid it actually won't.  Increasing pay by ~$3.00 an hour across the board will inevitably result in lay offs and an increased price in goods.

I'm not saying raising minimum wage is objectively bad.  But the truth (and somewhat the problem) is that businesses are businesses to make money.  And if they end up making less, they will give longer hours to fewer people.
