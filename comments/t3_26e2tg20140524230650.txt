Dude is completely bonkers. People are focusing on his virginity, but even if he weren't a virgin he'd be fixating on how often he had sex. If he had a girlfriend and she broke up with him, he'd fixate on her dating a lesser man. His delusions of grandeur would follow him and he would always find something to be upset about. I wonder what his last thoughts were when he shot himself. Did he feel any remorse or fear of punishment? Or was it a last act of self-love that no one else would determine his fate?
