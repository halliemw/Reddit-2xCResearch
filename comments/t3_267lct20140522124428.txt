I'm an XY.  This one really makes my blood boil.  "Ma'am" and "sir" are said as a sign of respect.  It has nothing to do with age.  I will call boys half my age "sir" in many contexts.

Instead of being self conscious about whether somebody thinks you're old or not, how about "Wow, that was nice of him / her to address me in such a respectful manner."
