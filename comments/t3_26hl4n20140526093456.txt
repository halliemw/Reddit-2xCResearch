The diva cup is one of the larger menstrual cups, have you looked into a smaller cup, or a differently shaped one? There was a really informational spreadsheet posted on here awhile back comparing nearly 20 different cups, there's actually a wide range of sizes (can't seem to find it to link, though). Apart from that, I know the cup can degrade over time, though most advice I've seen gives it 5-10 years. Of it's irritating on insertion/removal, you could try using some water as lube, or maybe coconut oil (which is a really awesome lube in general, and doesn't smell/feel as bad as synthetic lubes IMO). When I first tried tampons i had similar issues cause they were essentially "going in dry."
