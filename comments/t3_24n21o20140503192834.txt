I was in a similar situation, I ended up quitting.

Some jerk co-worker grabbed my ass when we were alone, I told him to stop it and he just laughed and tried to do it again.  I got really serious and told him to get away from me.  Against my better judgment, I took it easy on the jerk and reported it to his supervisor (a peer) instead of mine (the vice-president).

His supervisor talked with him and the guy avoided me for awhile.  Fine by me.  Then he started getting more cocky and started making comments to my other co-workers about what a bitch I was being lately while I was standing right there, and I went to my supervisor this time.

The VP calls both myself and the jerk into his office, the jerk owns up and gets a two week suspension.  Fine, whatever.  But then the VP calls the jerk's supervisor into the room with me and the jerk's supervisor says I never told him about anything, so he had no reason to take it to the VP himself.

I was livid.  It's one of the few times I ever lost my cool at work and I stormed out to the main floor and called the jerk's supervisor (now referred to as Jerk x 2) every name in the book, most starting with "You fucking lying _______"  I was shaking I was so pissed and left for the day.  

Jerk x 2 tried to have me suspended for being disrespectful, but I showed them the security tape (thank goodness I was in good with security) that shows the ass grabbing followed by me marching up to Jerk x 2's office and a lot of hand waving on my part.

The VP told me that is was finished, but I was called into his office along with the other female accounting staff for a talk about how we should keep our distance from the male drivers, so as not to have these sorts of problems.  I gave my notice two days later.

You haven't done anything wrong, but it's just easier to ignore the problem than deal with it on their part.  Decide how much of yourself you really have invested in this job and leave if it's not worth your sanity.
