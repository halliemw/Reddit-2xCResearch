There was a thread the other day over at TrollX about this subject. She recently gotten the surgery, and my friend asked her why it took so long to finally get approved. This was her response:

> Generally, doctors won't do tubal ligations on women younger than 35 or so, and most prefer her to have had at least one kid. Partially it's because of our social attitudes regarding women and kids/childbirth, and partially it's because legally, a woman who regretted it could sue the doctor for malpractice. I've known that I don't want kids since I was 14 (I'm 29 now), and given that I haven't wavered once, I think my doctor is safe from my legal wrath.
