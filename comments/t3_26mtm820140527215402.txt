I'm 22 and don't live in the States, but here we are told every year (starting either at age 20 or 2 years after you are first sexually active) until you have 2 clear ones in a row, then it's every 3 years (so if your first 2 are clear , after the second one you wait 3 years). I've had low-grade changes for the last two years so I go every year, hoping it'll sort itself out soon!
