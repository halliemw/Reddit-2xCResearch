I think it is a nice gesture towards the teenage parents. Having been in that place, it was an extremely hard time for me. I felt like giving up lots of times; I still got great grades, but I endured a lot of bullying and harassing from people both inside and outside school. I was looked down on by classmates and teachers alike. It was a horrible time for me, and I wish someone had done such a thoughtful thing, instead of the endless stream of insults and stares I got every time I left my house in an uniform with a pregnant belly.
