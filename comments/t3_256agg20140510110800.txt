Hey.

I just wanted to say I'm sorry for what you went through yesterday.  I saw the removed comments, and I agree that you received a *lot* of shit.  Your post, having received enough (well-deserved!) attention to make it to the top of the "hot", got a disproportionately high level of trolling or just mean comments.  We removed it all as quickly as we could but still obviously you saw a lot of it and you deserve better.

I hope that in time we'll have less problems (and maybe we'll be able to tweak our Automod to catch more, faster).  But I'm really sorry about how people treated you.
