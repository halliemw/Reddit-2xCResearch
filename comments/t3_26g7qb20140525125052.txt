That's when you just need to clear your schedule for the next few hours, go home, and let things run their awful hormonal course.  My last boyfriend didn't get why sometimes I'd just cry for no reason.  He assumed the worst, that I was hiding something from him, and would grill me looking for an answer which only made me cry more or fall into a panic.  When you spend your whole life in control of your emotional fluctuations and look at things through an analytical lens, it can be really hard to sympathize with this emotionally whacked out woman who only moments before was a rational and mature adult.
