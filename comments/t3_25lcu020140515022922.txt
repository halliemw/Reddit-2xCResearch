See that's just funny because both me and my SO (male) prefer the "girl bikes" because it makes urban bike riding a lot easier (get on/off a lot). Ah who am i kidding I just find it random to have a bar so high when, if you by any chance fall, will crush  your bits on. I do find it stupid that they are marketed as girl bikes. How about not sexualizing a fucking tool, mkay? There are no girl hammers or electrolyzers.
