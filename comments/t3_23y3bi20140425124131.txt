I am petite and had a very large baby that stretched my stomach out. No matter how much I diet or work out, I will always have a gross wrinkly stomach that needs to be hidden. I can wear bikinis, but only ruched, high-rise bottoms to cover my stomach. I wish my stomach looked half as good as OP's. My only solution would be to get a skin tuck. I'm OK with it, my daughter likes to look at it and I tell her how she used to fit inside there, but I find acceptance of it by others 
is difficult.
