People would only ever ask me for help to pick frames that suited them (I was an optical assistant), even though I was perfectly capable of repairs, adjustments, optical dispensing, and basic testing.  
I would greet someone at the counter and they would ignore me and talk to my male coworker who was busy with his back turned instead because I was *obviously* just the receptionist, because girls are only receptionists.
