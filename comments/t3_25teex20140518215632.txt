I took a look on /r/pcos and there were mentions of metaformin. I think my doctor said that particular drug might be used as a later resort in my trials because of my need for a contraceptive. Can it be taken in conjunction with birth control pills?

I am not currently on anti-depressants, but with all that's going on, I feel like I should be. Or at least get properly diagnosed, so I know what I have and how to combat it. It's just the birth control pills that are exacerbating my condition right now.
