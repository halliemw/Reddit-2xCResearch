> Sometimes I'll come across the creepy type who tries to get too friendly. They generally ask pretty quickly if you're married/engaged/dating, and I usually answer either engaged or married in an attempt to discourage any further creepiness.

Sometimes? I took to wearing bike shorts under even ankle-length skirts because of how often they'd try to get a look under my skirt. And, no shame, they do this in front of their wives.

But yes, wearing a left hand ring and telling them I'm married is the most effective way of discouraging them. Disgusting that they only 'respect' a woman if she belongs to a man, but all westerners are whores, apparently.
