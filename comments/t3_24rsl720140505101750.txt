your frist time should, above all, be with somebody you trust. if this FWB guy is a good friend and you trust him, then maybe that's what you need for a first partner. It doesn't have to mean anything more. Your partner should know, though, because it can lead to stronger emotions. It is a VERY intimate experience, and even casual sex can be surprisingly "momentous" with a partner. And it can also just be fund a dirty with somebody you care about deeply. As long as you communicate and trust your partner, you don't ahve anything to worry about.
