Tell your friend to go fuck herself, your dress is beautiful! It suits your body well and the sweetheart neckline is lovely! I really love the lace part. 

If you are feeling not 100% about it consider some embellishments on the top of the ruching on the waist.

You could also post this to r/weddingplanning for more advice.
