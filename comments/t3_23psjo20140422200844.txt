I'm sorry you're going through this. May I ask about your thoughts on adoption? If you're feeling this sad and apprehensive, maybe take some time and reconsider your options. You don't HAVE to abort, even though you think it's logical based on your finances and career path. I hope you and your boyfriend find a way to get through this well. *hugs*
