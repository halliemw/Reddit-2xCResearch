For starting out with a thong go with the thinest back, G-string or thin thong, in a soft fabric. If it feels too tight go up a size. Your butt will swallow the fabric and you will get used to the feeling. 

Lace and seamless panties don't show under most dresses/slacks if that was the reason for the thong.
