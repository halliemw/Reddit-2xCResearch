> This year I did not attend the Richmond Homeschool Prom, but my brother and a huge group of my friends did. **I heard several reports from eyewitnesses that Clare was in fact dancing provocatively, and that her dress was hiked way up around her thighs**.

> I am not one to judge, and I am not one to jump to conclusions either. I am sorry that Clare's senior prom was ruined. But the fact of the matter is that Clare was kicked out for a reason (**eight other people were kicked out for similar reasons --but Clare claims she is the only one**). People aren't kicked out of prom for "swaying back and forth" and wearing an appropriate dress. **The prom coordinators and chaperones weren't out to get Clare**.

Talk about twisted narrative. Jeez.
