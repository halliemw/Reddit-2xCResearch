Keep in mind kids are just extensions of yourself. Miniature little yous that want to be independent. Tell them what you would have wanted to know and guide them along in life.

Also coming from a female perspective, school clothes and hair are a really big deal. My family was really poor and my mother wasn't feminine so as a result elementary school was terrible for me. If you can get her into a school with uniforms it's probably better. Individuality is cool until you have 1500000 Jbeiber girls running around with photos of his head on their shirt.
