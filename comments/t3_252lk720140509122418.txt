Question for you... I hope you don't find it offensive, but I'm curious. Admittedly I do not know a lot about Islam or Sharia law. 

I gather you live in the USA, also I don't know how you grew up, but I feel judging from your post is safe to assume it wasn't strict. So my questions are this, is it a culture shock to visit a country with Sharia law in place and do you feel unsafe visiting, as one wrong move may come with harsh consequences?
