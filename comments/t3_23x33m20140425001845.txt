It's a really interesting topic! It works especially well if you can relate it to the area of law you want to practice in, or a program you are interested in at that school (I wrote one personal statement for all the schools and just tweaked a paragraph or two). 

You can still register for the June LSAT, which I totally recommend if you're planning on applying for Fall 2015. The deadline is May 6th, and the late registration deadline is May 16th, so you have some time to think about it. As I'm sure you know, most schools do rolling admissions, so the sooner you apply, the better shot you have of getting in (though I applied in January, and it wasn't a problem). I suggest you take the June exam if you feel at-all ready, because then you can re-take it in October if you don't like your score, and still apply fairly early in the cycle. The LSAT isn't as awful as people seem to make it out to be, I'm sure you're going to kick its ass.
