You're definitely making sense. And as a show watching GoT fan who hasn't had time to read the books I've heard the books did it differently. As it stands that's the most messed up scene I've ever witnessed on film.

As a lover of Stephen King, most of his work thrives on inner monologue and I find this is why his films are usually terrible (but so is some of his writing). I think that it would be nice if filmmakers could find a way to do voiceover monologues without making it seem so cheesy.
