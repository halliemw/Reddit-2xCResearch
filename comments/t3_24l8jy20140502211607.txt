I'm so, so sorry this happened to you. I honestly don't know what to suggest, but I want you to know you're not being ignored. Have you tried contacting rape crisis centers about this? Even if it's not the best place to go, it's somewhere to start and I'm sure people there can give you a clearer idea of what to do next. Good luck!
