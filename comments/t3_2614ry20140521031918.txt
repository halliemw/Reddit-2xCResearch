I've worked for 4 different labs in granular materials, thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and antimatter. But I'm kind of a bust because I've only been first author on one paper as an undergrad (although I've given presentations). Lately switched to theory because I just love doing quantum mechanics and math. I can also program.
