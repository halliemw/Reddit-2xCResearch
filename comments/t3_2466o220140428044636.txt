Get loud. Call them out. Yeah, it's embarrassing, but it's embarrassing for them not you, you're just getting residual embarrassment. Pick up the condom and walk up to them. Ask them 'what the fuck?' 'Is this supposed to be funny?' 'Did you think you could get your dick wet by throwing condoms at people?' 

Don't do this when you fear it might escalate the situation. But if you're in an area with lots of other people, get loud. It sucks. And it's okay if you're teary. Hell, use the tears to your advantage, make a scene. Post about it on twitter, or facebook or reddit, if you don't feel safe at the time. Tell people about the slimy douchebags you saw, make them into a joke.
