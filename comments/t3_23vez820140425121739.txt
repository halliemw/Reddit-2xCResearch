I think you're conflating two separate issues:

1.  Many women active online (whether in games, by blogging, commenting on social media sites, writing for major media outlets, etc.) receive absurdly abusive messages from (male) users attacking them and their arguments on the basis of their gender and using gendered statements ("get back in the kitchen," "tits or gtfo," "you must be on the rag") and threats ("rape") to attack women.  There are no statistics simply because it's impossible to quantify such a massive amount of data, particularly when it can't be tracked.

2.  Investors simply aren't as willing to put their money into start-ups owned/run by women than they are by companies owned and run by men.  It takes a LOT of money to begin a successful start-up on a major scale; basically, investors are paying the salaries of 5 or more people (who usually make about $50,000 a year and more in some states like CA) to code, manage, and network a site for a year or more before the site/app/service begins earning a positive revenue stream.  That's simply how long it takes.  Your average webdev doesn't have the money set aside to take a year in order to pursue their own interests and begin a business, nor do they have the funds to support several other developers through that same period of time.  Investors are vital to start-ups.  If investors are less willing to invest in women's start-ups, less women are actually able to become entrepreneurs.  It's not that they aren't interested or are scared; it's that there simply isn't means available for them to do so.
