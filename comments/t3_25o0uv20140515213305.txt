I live in Utah.  Many marriages happen after a few months of dating (2-4).  That said, there is usually a very large amount of cultural, religious, social compatibility. 

Don't get married on instinct, talk it through, study it, get others' opinions.  Do your homework on his background, family and expectations.

All this said, the most important element of marriage is a commitment to stay married and grow with one another.  You will both change and need to know that you will do all you can to help the other.

How to approach your Mom? The same way you will approach everything in your new life- unflinching and complete honesty and emotional openness.  Non-judgmental listening to the opinion of another and a willingness to take advice and consider what is best.  Completely bare your feelings, be willing to incorporate others' viewpoints if they are valid and then do what is best for you (and your spouse if you do get married).  Talk to her soon, she deserves it.
