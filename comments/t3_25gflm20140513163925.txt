Ex-fat girl here (dropped 60 pounds over a year and a half; dropped from BMI of 32 to 21). I was eating healthy foods and exercising like I was "supposed to" but my weight didn't budge for a mixture of reasons:

1. Not drinking enough water (this one is HUUUUGE)
2. Not tracking the calories in/out meticulously enough (even being off by a tablespoon or ounce hurts, especially if you underestimate by that measure three times every day)
3. Not sleeping enough (weight loss increased dramatically when I consistently slept 8-10 hours instead of 6-7 a night)

I made those three big changes over the course of a month, and from there my weight started steadily dropping by 0.5-1.5 pounds a week. Every time I started fucking one of those three things up, the weight loss stalled and sometimes even gained.
