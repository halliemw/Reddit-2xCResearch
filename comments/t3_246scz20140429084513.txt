*Bridesmaids* grossed $288M on a budget of $33M. Net: $245M, **ROI: 742%** (which is crazy amazing and no, I'm not doing time value here).

So each dollar invested would return you over $7, a far better bet than one invested in *Captain America: Winter Soldier* (which is doing phenomenal business, just not as great as *Brides*, a true once-in-a-decade phenom). Each dollar invested in *Cap* might get you $4-5 back, which again is fantastic, but it ain't $7.
