So, I'm a guy, but I think I can contribute to this somewhat. I am in college currently. Seven of my fenale friends have been raped, and it isn't exactly like I'm close to a lot of girls such that they would tell me such things. It was a rather rude awakening and the approach people take to the subject is sickening. I'll be honest, I used to use the word rape in order to describe any bad situation, but after seeing what it does to people, I just couldn't. So while I do get rather hurt sometimes when girls seem vaguely uncomfortable around me, I'll fucking put up with it, because if that outlook keeps them safe, that's more important.
