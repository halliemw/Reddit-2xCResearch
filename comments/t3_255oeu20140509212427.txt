Every so often he says he's going to call me more, be a better dad etc. Then he'll follow through with 2 phone calls tops and then disappear again. 

As much as I want to tell him off, I am afraid of him getting my hopes up only to crush me again. 

Do you think it's worth it? Are you glad you said your piece? Did it make you feel any better?
