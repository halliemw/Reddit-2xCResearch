The "empowering ads" are definitely a new positive,carrot technique instead of the usual negative, stick one that is used in women's ads (both manipulative). You rarely see this kind of advertising in men's ads.

See this: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/17/sexist-vintage-ads_n_1798977.html#slide=1396787 but also now. The format is:

You as a woman do THIS (shock, disgust, horror shown at natural fact of life)
Are you sure you want to allow that to happen, and risk social shame, losing your loved one's affection. ( threat)
But wait, we have a solution!
Cue pictures of women being extatic, proffesional and attractive all in one

Omg you bleed once a month and therefore might get stained pants? That would be a CATASTROPHE! Buy our shit and you can become a gymnast wearing skirts. 

Does your laundry look like shit and you as a woman do it, obviously? Do our product - cue happy family and appreciative loving husband. 

Do your bowels produce farts? Holy shit you disgusting beast. Eat yoghurt. Now you are a sexy yoga master!


Etc etc etc.
