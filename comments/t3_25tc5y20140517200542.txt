The amount doesn't matter, really. 

You know, I think that although Grand Juries are sort of intimidating (formal setting), they will also be kind and they will listen.  It is going to be good for you to testify.  Obviously, if your locality had a more aggressive D.A., you wouldn't be doing that - so you might want to get interested in local politics in the future (maybe way in the future).
