She needs therapy... yesterday. And to dump your dumbass friend's butt. Sorry, you might like the guy, but to react with such a deep confession with "I'd dump you if I didn't love you" is... cuntish. Makes me want to punch him in his stupid face.  
  
If you can keep it up, just listen to her. Let her know you're out of things to say, but that you do care about her as a great friend. Remind her of all the people who love her.  
  
Gods... I feel like I'm living in the past. I also had a good friend who was depressive, anorexic, and became alcoholic while I knew her. It really was the death of her. Please, *please* get your friend into therapy. Go with her if it will make her feel better. And give her a hug from me.
