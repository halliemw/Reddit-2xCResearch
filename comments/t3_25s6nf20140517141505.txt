Do you know what's sexy? Yeses.

Saying "no" can ruin the mood. But yeses? Yeses are great and fun. Yeses are sexy. You don't have to worry that a "yes" is a hidden "no." I live by "[enthusiastic consent](http://www.doctornerdlove.com/2013/03/enthusiastic-consent/)" for myself and my partner. If I want more, I'll say it. Give me chances to say "Yes."

I set boundaries before we get hot and heavy. "My pants aren't coming off tonight." "Let's take it slow. I don't want to past second base." If they ask to go past it twice to strong "nos" I might say, "I've told you 'no' twice. If you ask again, I'll ask you to leave. I like you. This is fun. But you need to respect my boundaries." 

If you're already making out, and he's pushing to go forward, you can say "I'm really enjoying where I'm at."
