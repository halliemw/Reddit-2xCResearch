Gifts are superficial.  You need to re evaluate how important some junk you don't need is to you for just another day in your life. 

Your boyfriend is not in the wrong by not buying you things for some day. If he spent time with you and made an effort to show his appreciation of you a little extra on those days, that would be nice. But, beyond a "happy birthday" you are holding far to much weight over his head. 

My SO knows how I feel she doesn't get upset when I don't buy her gifts. She might still get me something on my birthday but she is someone that puts far to much importance on this stuff.  And she readily admits it. 

Also,  cards. Fuck cards. They are nothing more that fire starters.
