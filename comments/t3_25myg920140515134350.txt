I have never heard of BC shrinking your boobs or making them saggy. I have been on about 5 different BC's. The first 4 were years ago, trying to find one that didn't give me mood swings, which were very easy to live with. The 5th was recently when I found my stomach didn't like handling the hormones and make me nauseous and loss of appetite. My gyno said that was pretty rare but I use the Nuva Ring now and love it.

BC side effects, at least the major ones, are very rare.
