If people only displayed their political beliefs when they wouldn't "annoy" other people, there'd be no point in having them in the first place. Anything so uncontroversial as to lose the power to potentially "annoy" isn't a belief; it's a cliche.

>I'd be pretty annoyed if I saw someone wearing an "Abortion is murder" logo on their graduation cap, so by the same token, I don't think a pro-choice message is appropriate in that situation.

Why do you assume that each position is of equal legitimacy? Would you assume the same of such opposing statements as, say, "End homophobia!" and "Kill all fags!"?
