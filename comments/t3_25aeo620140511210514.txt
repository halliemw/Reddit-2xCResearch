Keep in mind, that rape doesn't always happen because the girl was gorgeous, all sorts of people get raped, even the elderly. For a great deal of rapists, it's a power/control trip for them. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, definitely take it up with the management. You should be able to feel safe in your own apartment building.
