I don't have anything to share, as my pregnancy and birth were straight forward and complication free (but I'm currently pregnant so who knows what will happen in the next ~5 months, knock on wood).

I did want to say that many of these comments make me incredibly sad as I am a doula and I am seeing a lot of malpractice and misinformation going on. I admire all of you for powering through your experiences. Being pregnant and giving birth takes so much strength (as does healing as a bystander), even more so if not everything goes to plan.

I wish every single one of you the best.
