Some women just, you know, *want* to cover up for the sake of modesty. I wouldn't want to wander around topless because I would feel uncomfortable walking around topless and my clothing choices are my choice. I don't think that not wanting to walk around topless makes me a bad feminist. I just don't want to, and that's all the reason I need.

Speaking of feminism: Isn't it a good thing to move emphasis away from looks and toward intelligence and personality?
