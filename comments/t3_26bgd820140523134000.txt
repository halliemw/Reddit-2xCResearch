You're going to get through this. I know it sucks, and its' going to for a while. But you're going to get through this. You're an amazing, strong person, and if you find someone else you like, that makes you happy, you'll be the better for it. If you find you enjoy standing by yourself, and that makes you happy, go for it. 

You can make it. He doesn't know what he missed out on. You can make it through the next hour. And the rest of the day. And the day after that. Next thing you know, it'll be the whole weekend. And then a week will pass and a month, and a few months. And before you know it, it'll just be a small sting, and you'll be happy.
