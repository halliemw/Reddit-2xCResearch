That is definitely heartening to hear. I'm working on doing things for myself. Figuring out how to be single because honestly i've never been a single adult. This is all new for me. I really hope to be where you are in 9 months time.  :)  And the vindictive side of me hopes that his new relationship will crumble quickly too. But either way, no contact, no e-stalking. I'm done.
