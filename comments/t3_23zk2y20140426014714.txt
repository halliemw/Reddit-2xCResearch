Sexuality is totally fluid, and it's normal to keep experiencing new things throughout your life. Having a crush on a girl doesn't mean you're gay, necessarily. You may later decide you identify as bi- or pan-sexual, or you may decide that you're definitely straight and that this crush is anomalous. Whatever you land on, IT'S OKAY! And it's also okay to keep re-examining your feelings and redefining yourself through your whole life.
