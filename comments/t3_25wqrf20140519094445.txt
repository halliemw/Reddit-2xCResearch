No it's not sexist. 

This book analyzes one particular type of abusive relationship. It examines the mentality of men who abuse women. It's doesn't appear to assume that ever abuser is male and every victim is female. 

Sometimes the way people think is tied to the gender roles prescribed by society. It might not be effective to replace all the pronouns because relationships where women are the abuser might work in slightly different ways. In a similar sense, gay or polygamous abusive relationships might function in different ways as well. This book focuses abuse dynamics in one kind of relationship. 

It doesn't claim that it's the only type of abusive relationship that exists in the world nor does it discredit other forms of abusive relationships.
