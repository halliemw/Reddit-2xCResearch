Do you eat a lot of wheat products? You said you ear a lot of carbs.

I cut processed breads, pastas, crackers and chips completely out of my diet and I felt better within days.

If you have the time read "It Starts with Food." it does a fantastic job of explaining how many of the foods we consume in the modern diet are not good for us.

You can also google "Whole30." its the website companion to the book, and it does a good job of explaining their philosophy without requiring you buy the books.

If you have any other questions, you can PM me ðŸ˜Š
