Does it?  Assuming that everyone got the high-end grade in their range (ie if it says "85-90" then those people got a 90), then the average grade by gender is almost the exact same (between 87 and 88).  It doesn't look like it because there are as many women at the top as men...but there's also an equal # of women at the bottom as men, there just aren't as many women in the middle.
