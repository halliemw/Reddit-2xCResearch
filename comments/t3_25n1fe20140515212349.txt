I would like to see more general focus on women being healthy. It's great to be happy with your body. But I think it would be even better to be happy about having a healthy body. Of course, the question is, what's a healthy body? At the very least I can say that being thin due to self-starvation isn't any healthier than over eating. I would love to have seen this video do more focus on being healthy than on being happy with whatever we are right now.
