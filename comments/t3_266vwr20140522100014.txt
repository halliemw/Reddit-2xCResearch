I'm mid-40s and sometimes feel a little sad that I've never been able to have what I view as a close relationship with my mother. She's pretty much like yours - same beliefs in action. 

I have tried to accept that it is just the way things are, and that my close relationships will always bee my husband and a few friends. dad and brother are out too- same reasons- conservative and religious worldview that I can't buy.

I have also revealed and regretted. My mom thinks I just recently tried pot. She thinks that because I recently said one thing about pot use. She is fooling herself. Who tries pot for the first time in their 40s? Who believes that's a thing people do? I'm sure it's happened, but in whose reality is that the norm?
I started smoking weed in 1986. No one pretends like my mother.


Anyway, the value of my vagina has been decreasing ever since I drove it off the lot- also in 1986. So, the sigh of relief from both parents when an actual man actually married me was a good one. Sorry to say, this will probably always be this way for you too. My folks have become more conservative as they age and it has a lot to do with my brother providing them grandchildren to defend against the evils of the world.
