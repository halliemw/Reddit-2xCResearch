See,  it's hard for me to say exactly which situation it is, but I guess it's the first because she doesn't ask me for advice/tell me stuff unless I've already started the conversation with her. Only small exception is when there's something she's really worried about affecting her, I guess.

I asked her about the gift thing yesterday and she claims it's because she always likes the gifts I give her and feels self-conscious that I won't like them. Which is really weird to me because I always tell her I like them. She's actually decent at gift giving, but I get really frustrated that I have to wait until she "feels like" giving them to me. The gift she gave me for my last birthday is actually one of my favorite presents I've received as an adult and I've told her so.

The thing that I really have trouble with in terms of just accepting her as not an initiator is that I don't really have a lot of friends and I've had trouble with friends leaving me in the past (usually because I picked wrong having them as friends in the first place or something). So when she never seems to consider me when I'm not around (or at least doesn't let me know), it makes me feel like she doesn't care. It's kind of an insecurity, I'll admit. 

Like, I pointed out to her that my birthday is coming up and while I don't want or expect any presents (because I don't really care either way), I kind of wished she would have mentioned it at some point. Maybe asked me what I might want to do. I'm not asking her to plan it or anything (though I already have hers planned a couple months later). I'm just saying that since she knows I care about doing something on my birthday, it might have occurred to her to wonder. Of course, after I brought it up, she asked me what I wanted to do, but I kind of felt like it didn't count if I had to prompt her and I said so.
