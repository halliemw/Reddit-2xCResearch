Also, while I appreciate the global inclusion of the willing, the fact of the matter is that most men will, by the nature of the subreddit, not feel as though they belong here. I realize that there are the men that will go ahead and participate in discussions in this subreddit, but there is an inherent discord about a man trying to make his statements heard in a caucus of women. It is a female home turf, unfamiliar to the few willing men that will actively participate in a discussion of female affairs. Unequal.
