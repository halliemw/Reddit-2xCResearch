I understand your point perfectly well. I'm inclined to agree. I don't think it would ever reach that 80% mark (although it may if all these women claiming to jump ship do), but for me personally as long as it it's core the subreddit is about women, then I think it's okay. If the discussions are about women and for women. 

The problem with a gender related subreddit, is there isn't a non-discriminatory way to remove influence from the other gender, or even a way at all. Now that this board is a default board it is more visible and more women and men are going to come and want to participate. 

The way people talk about this subreddit now, I just kind of assumed this sub will turn into a feminist sub and what was "2X" will make a new sub and migrate. I'm sure I'm wrong, but it *feels* like every few posts is a farewell post.
