I don't even bother with buying shirts from regular stores anymore. Old Navy is REALLY hit-or-miss with a lot of their stuff, so I stick to what I know because I'm super confident about those things.

I don't know if this will help or not - I modeled my wardrobe intentionally, based off of a capsule wardobe that [Allie at WardrobeOxygen](http://www.wardrobeoxygen.com/search/label/capsule%20wardrobe) designed (specifically [this one](http://www.wardrobeoxygen.com/2013/01/sahm-wardrobe-what-to-wear.html) as a model with some subtitutions). It *really* helped me get beyond having "nothing to wear" by having a collection of things that I *know* go together, all the way down to shoe selection.
