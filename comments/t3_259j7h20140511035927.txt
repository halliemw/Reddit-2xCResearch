Dude, so, I have always had hair around butt-length. I was walking from the subway to my house one day, back when I still lived in Hollywood, and some woman *took a picture of me* from her car at a stoplight, because apparently having long hair means that that's *totally okay*. At least she shouted that I had beautiful hair as she drove away... it was super, super weird, though.
