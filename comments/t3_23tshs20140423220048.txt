Thank you... but I don't know how to do it. I also fear that he may want to take my daughter away from me - because I forbade him from seeing her when she was about 4 months old (he hit me a lot and I finally got the courage to press charges. But then he started therapy and changed. He never hit me again, and we were fine for a while, but now he's started to be emotionally abusive).
