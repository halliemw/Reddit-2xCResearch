This seems like the best response to me.

Clearly this is a gross invasion of OP's personal sanctity, and OP needs to make the man aware of that. 

But too many other posters here seem ready to assume that he's some kind of evil mutant, [inherently flawed in character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error); as opposed than some guy that doesn't quite understand how bad or dangerous this would feel, but hypocritically values the privacy of his phone highly.

He certainly could be a scumbag, maybe it's even likely, but OP's story doesn't give us enough info to determine that. So I really like your reasonable plan of action.
