I am learning to sew because I want to make quilts and tailor my clothing.  I also enjoy gardening in the backyard of the house I rent with roommates.  My friends wrinkled their noses and said "that's too girly  - do something more badass.  Men like women who have sexy hobbies, not their grandma's hobby."  ... as if my hobby is all about getting men?  Well I think it's a useful and pragmatic skill to have, and it's creative and relaxing.   Furthermore, I am not a 'badass' and that's ok.  I will never be a drag racer or a martial arts expert or a tattoo artist.  It's ok to be kind of average, but our society makes people people think that they have to overachieve and work themselves to the bone.  Furthermore, I already work in a male dominated field (PR/marketing) so it isn't like I am purposely conforming to old gender roles or something.
