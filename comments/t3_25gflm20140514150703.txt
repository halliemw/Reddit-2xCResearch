You talked about exercise and diet, I talked about exercise and diet.  It was linear and did not involve your holistic philosophy at that time.  I don't know you, all I know is what you offered up, it is all I commented on.

Your choices are fine for you, I really don't care what you do.  It is significantly different than what you stated before, and I was not out of line to speak about it in a polite way.

"Why not me" and successfully living are 2 separate things, they can not exist together.  [You have my pity too](http://imgur.com/MoIFgdH)
