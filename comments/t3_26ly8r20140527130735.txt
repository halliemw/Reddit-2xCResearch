yeah that auto glass is really sturdy, until it.... isn't. but you got away safely and that is what matters! also if they're working on prosecuting him, could you include a small claim against him for the cost of the glass? idk how it would work, precisely, but it could be worth looking into. i know for me, that $145 would be a significant amount of money that i would want back.
