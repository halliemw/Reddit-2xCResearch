I have the same "issue" (although I don't consider it a problem). I agree totally with not calling it "faking". I can get immense pleasure out of sex and g-spot stimulation so the way that I've explained it to my SO is that clitoral orgasms are really intense but short, whereas gspot orgasms are kind of like smaller waves of pleasure like mini orgasms that can kind of go on forever. Although I wouldn't personally really define it as a "true" orgasm, it still feels amazing. He gets that and that definition seemed to help him understand and get that... that's as good as it gets and it's fantastic, but usually he gets me off a few times by clitoral stimulation as well. My point of this is: you should tell him, maybe that type of explanation could help or something to that effect (if it is true for you), and your sex life can only benefit (maybe he will make more of an effort to perform oral/manual clitoral stimulation if he knows?). Good luck! :)
