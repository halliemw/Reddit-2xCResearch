I know. I was being sarcastic. That's what I meant by the /s. Sorry if I didn't make that very clear, and maybe this wasn't the appropriate time for sarcasm. But understand, I don't at all feel like he is the victim here. I think it's stupid that idiots will give a victim trouble simply because they mentioned details such as race/ethnicity about their attacker.
