"A league of their own" is full of strong female characters. Because it has such a full cast of women, they can break stereotypes and be more complete as a group since they aren't required to all be a representation of all womanhood. They can afford to  each have one faults and strengths without undermining women since they aren't required to represent an entire population by themselves.

Edit: rapid_alpaca brings a great point about agency. This movie shows women choosing to be chaste or promiscuous, strong or weak, homemaker or ball player and not a single one is shown to be an outsider or like their choice is wrong. They are accepted by each and every member of the team and the audience is expected to root for each of them. Plus the token male character is also well rounded and has an arc so equality all around.

Can you tell I love this movie?
