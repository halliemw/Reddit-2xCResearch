As someone kinda new to Reddit, the psychology of the voting system is really interesting to me. Before making an account I had lurked a bit, mostly for news articles on topics of interest to me. I thought to myself, "These people are silly, if I had an account I would never downvote something I disagreed with unless it was off-topic." And then I spent some time digging around the comments in various subreddits, wielding the downvote like a claymore. (Sorry!)

It's definitely something that I, personally, need to stop doing, because I'm not being a good neighbor or helping constructive discussion. But it's hard because there's something satisfying about working to silence opposition, especially if they're being sexist, offensive, etc. I know it's not right and I need to do right by Reddit, but the allure is there and I fell to temptation.

I do see a lot of on-topic replies get downvoted into oblivion here. I hope it gets better and I'm going to stop being part of the problem.
