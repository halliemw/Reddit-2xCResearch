I think a lot of it comes down to what items do you find important to get done and what does he find important? If doing the dishes every night before bed and stocking the pantry is important to you, it falls to you. Now, you might ask that he at least rinse his dishes instead of letting them get crusty and write down the things he specifically wants on an on-going list you keep on the fridge to make shopping easier.

It might be that car maintenance is important to him so he's in charge of making sure all that is squared away. Or that the trash is taken out nightly, so if you at least pull it out of the can when it's full and put a new bag in, he'll take it outside.

It might be that you need to take on the invisible tasks anyhow because he's just not going to see everything you do or want done, so you just give him easy chores to remember and that he can't be afraid of doing wrong (and if he doesn't do it your way, that's too bad, you cannot say anything unless he's shrinking your clothes or shredding the carpet somehow). Hell, I'm in charge of my own house and I barely remember to change my air filters and I don't always clean the baseboards. Everyone has their own priorities.
