Well, I have actually never dated anyone for whom abortion was NOT an option, so it's hard for me to imagine, but I would definitely expect a man to stop sleeping with me if I decided I wanted babies all of a sudden, of course!

edit:  also, if I ever DID decide that I wanted babies, I would talk to my fiance immediately and we would probably break up over it, but I can't really imagine changing my mind that drastically.
