Aside from getting that you liked the article, I am having a hard time understanding you.  I can't tell what you think, your writing is confusing.

BTW, are you aware that there are hundreds of cultures where boys don't become boys by fist-fighting?  I guess I've really gravitated towards those cultures since my teens.  My dad did encourage me to be physically violent on a couple of occasions (I won, he was a good coach) and my daughters both got into physical fights (with other girls).    We have not, however, gotten beat up.  Not every boy gets beat up, either.  Many fights come to a close with a draw, and most (go to youtube) end after one or two punches, hardly enough to be considered a beat down.

Who, these days, shelters their girls in the way you imply in your last line?  May I assume that you are perhaps older (my age?)  Things have changed.  Girls fight a great deal, physically and otherwise, in US urban culture.  

Not everywhere, though.
