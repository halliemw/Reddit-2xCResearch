What goes on between you and your doctors is protected by doctor-patient confidentiality. Even if your mom pays the bill, that doesn't mean that she has any right to know what goes on with your medical history unless you choose to tell her. Call your doctor about these concerns and I'm sure they'll tell you the same thing.
