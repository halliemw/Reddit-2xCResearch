I'm lactose and gluten intolerant and if I have even a tiny bit of either of those, I bloat ridiculously and get constipated. :( You could try an elimination diet and see if there's something you regularly eat that you're actually intolerant to.

Gluten, Dairy, and Soy tend to be the biggies for people.
