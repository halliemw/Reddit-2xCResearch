Loathe it with a passion! I'm not even a swimmer, and I don't have a sexual partner at the moment, but I just can't stand it. Another user here mentioned the unhealthy weight-loss, the agonizing pain, diarrhea, the mess, the ruined clothing, the time spent crippled and out of commission. NO. I hate it, and wish voluntary hysterectomy was a thing. Or better yet, I've read about uterus transplants, where women in circumstances where they are seeking a uterus are given a transplant. So far such transplants have been from the recently deceased, but I'd be a happy volunteer for the procedure! I don't want it, so let a woman who wants one, have one!
