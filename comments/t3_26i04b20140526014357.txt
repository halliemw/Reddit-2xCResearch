I believe Civil Suits are also possibilities in cases such as this, though I am not entirely certain of the details involved with filing such a suit.  I would suggest consulting a lawyer about the possibility however, as it seems like a viable option if criminal charges cannot be laid.
On a personal note, I wanted to say that I'm sorry this happened to you, and that I hope you no longer suffer in silence.  As women were often made to feel as though our sexual experiences (good and bad) are our responsibility alone, and many religious groups will reinforce this idea.  You are not worthless, or used up, or impure because of this incident.  You will heal from this, and you are.  This asshole did not destroy you, and I want you to know that you're much more than he could ever touch!
