All these answers make it too muddy and confusing.  No wonder why so many women have trouble trying to define what it means to be a woman, and are confused and unhappy.  This is sad to watch women not be able to define womanhood.  

Bio female and adult.  Physical deformities, gender identities, and genetic abnormalities are asides and special instances, not inherent definitions. Know who you are..that's half the battle in life.
