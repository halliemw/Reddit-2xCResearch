I'm unlucky enough to have had dark thick hair over all those places since early teens. Been waxing my face, upper lip, neck, shaving my Stomach, plucking nipples and shaving feet as well as legs and armpits for as long as I can remember and I'm still only early twenties. I always wanted to get laser hair removal as soon as I can afford it, basically everywhere but mainly my face neck and torso, but this makes me worry if it will still all come back over future years. Anyone any advice/ knowledge of if that would happen??
