Actually, That did help and I do agree with you. While there are heroines that exist in the comic world that aren't over objectified, those comics aren't popular. I sited Maria Hill as an example in a different post. She-Hulk could be used as another example. As strong as the hulk, yet as smart as Banner. And she was allowed to keep her intelligence when she hulked out as opposed to Banner, who basically went Warren (something about Mary reference). But those characters don't catch on. Black Widow toys are selling more than Maria Hill toys are. Its like pizza. If your broccoli pizza isn't selling all that well, You don't go advertise it like its your selling point and push everything else down the menu. You advertise what is selling and hope that maybe people see the broccoli on the menu too.
