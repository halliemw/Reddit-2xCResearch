to be fair, i was molested by a gay man at a party once, and he told me i shouldn't be upset or angry because he was gay (and yes, he was actually gay). by no means am i saying that OP's friends aren't homophobic; i just wanted to point out that this kind of thing is perpetuated by some gay people as well. it's not purely a heterosexuals versus homosexuals issue.
