Those kids are assfaces. I'm sorry that happened to you. I agree with /u/niroby, next time some guys try to publicly shame you for their own amusement, call them out as loudly as you can/want. Especially if dad is around. I think he would have helped out if he knew what was really going on. He could have been distracted, nobody wants their daughter to be treated like that.
