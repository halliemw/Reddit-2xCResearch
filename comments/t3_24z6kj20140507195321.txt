I disagree at your first point. Consider the intended audience: responding to that first article written in Princeton's paper -- and others who might be curious. This response is definitely written for people who are new to the discourse. While it doesn't necessarily bring anything new, it communicates many of the ideas really well, in a timely response to that first awful article.
