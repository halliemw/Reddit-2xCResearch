Yeah I would definitely wait a couple more months and give your body some more time to adjust. That could definitely be the main problem. 3 periods a month would suck though, so I would switch too if the problem persisted.

Regarding my skin, I had flawless skin all throughout high school and a little bit into college, I NEVER had pimples, even on my period. Then when I turned 19 I started breaking out a lot on my chin and along my jawline, sometimes my cheeks. I attributed it to my newfound use of liquid foundation, which I do think contributed partly to it, but even after switching to powder foundation (which I always used in high school and never had problems), the acne on my chin didn't go away. It cleared up a on my cheeks, but that's it. Before I went on Erinn, my skin definitely wasn't clear, but it's given me constant painful cysts on my chin, one of them in the same spot that literally never goes away. It'll come to a head (sorry, TMI) and then go away for a day and then flare up again. So I definitely can't blame Erinn 100% for my acne, but it made my hormonal acne worse for sure. Luckily, my dermatologist prescribed me Aczone, so my skin from the chin up is flawless again, but my chin is still pretty bad. My gyno switched me to a different combo pill called Sprintec (the generic of Ortho Cyclen?) to hopefully help though. I just hope it doesn't give me hives lol. 

Other than that though, I liked Erinn. It didn't make me moody at all, I felt completely fine on it, and really had no bad side effects. The only complaint I had was it made my periods less regular. Off BC my periods have always been perfectly regular, to the point where I could predict exactly what days it would begin and end. Erinn made it to where my cycle would be 25 days some months, 29 days other months and then 20 days other times.
