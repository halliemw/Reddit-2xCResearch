Africa is not a country. The people there are not monolithic in their cultures or behavior. These incidents are taking place in the country of Nigeria, so your title should reflect that. 

When people refer to anything negative happening (starvation, war, etc.) as being a problem for "Africa" and not the specific culture or country it's taking place in, it reinforces the stereotypes that an entire continent and its inhabitants are primitive or violent. There is violence and disruption on almost every continent in the world, and in those cases we don't generalize-- we refer to the specific country or area where it takes place. So it shouldn't be any different for those in Africa.
