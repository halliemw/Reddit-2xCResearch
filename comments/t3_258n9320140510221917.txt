I've always been struck by how strange it is that we can't walk around in our underwear but we can walk around in bikinis. I only wear one-pieces because I would feel uncomfortable wearing anything else. I don't want strangers' eyes on my bare body and the greater parts of my boobs and butt-cheeks. Totally fine if other people want to do that, it's all personal preference, but I get huge pressure from other people when I'm wearing a one-piece like, what you aren't comfortable with your body? Do you think you're fat or something? You'd look much better in a bikini than that plain black thing, etc. You're so young, you should be in a bikini! Etc.

Maybe I'm just here to swim bitch!
