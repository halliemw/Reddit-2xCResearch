And *you* do realise that never before have we had posts in new hammered with so many downvotes, some hitting below -40 in a few hours, that we've never had so many overt trolls, some posting photos of aborted foetuses and going on anti-feminist rants - most of which *you* will never see because the mods keep removing them so *you* can pretend everything is fine, so many abusive PMs, or that we've never had so many nitwits come in with "Well, as a man who knows nothing about this terribly personal issue and has been here for 5 minutes, my opinion is..." and worse, other nitwits like you supporting them because "Diversity!" - would you say the same any other specialised demographic? "Well, as I cisgender/caucasian/uneducated person, my opinion on your ethnic/lbgt/doctor issues are..." "Thanks for your input! It's so valid and valuable!".

There's a difference between a popular piece receiving enough votes to show in /r/all every so often, people being aware of /r/TwoXChromosomes, and people being subscribed by default. Do you know what they're doing? They're browsing /r/all in new, or worse, targeting us. You think some of us are pissed off here? Well, there's a lot of general redditors that don't like /r/TwoXChromosomes (because boooo feminists or whatever) and they'll happily set out to make this place a shithole.

If you think the switch hasn't led to an influx of assholes and a change in dynamic, you're wrong.

If you think this won't damage the subreddit, you're wrong.

If you want to blindly believe this is a neutral or good thing, I can stop you bleating about it, but it's not and you're wrong.
