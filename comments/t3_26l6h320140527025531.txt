All of that is very normal. It can take a good few months for everything to settle down. Its common for bleeding to continue after you've finished the placebo week, that's not an issue. Its also common for it to take some time into the placebo week before your withdrawal bleed starts. I usually come on around the 3rd placebo day and stop about 3 days into the next pack. I would only start to worry if it gets to the end of the placebo week and you still haven't started - take a test if that happens, although it can also be normal for some people to completely miss periods on the pill.

For future reference, /r/birthcontrol is probably the best place for this kind of question!
