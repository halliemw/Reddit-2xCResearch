Do it, and do it ASAP. She might be a little pissed but she will quickly get over it as she gets busy. Tell her you simply cannot afford it. It's her special day, not yours-- you have no reason to stress out about money on her behalf.

Being a recent bride myself, I had a bridesmaid leading me on up till a few weeks before the wedding. It stressed me out and bugged me and I wished she would have just told me she wasn't going to make it--she ended up not even coming. I ended up with one bridesmaid and it was just fine. 

Edit: to add, I did ask my bridesmaid to buy her dress and shoes. While she had to stay in my color scheme she was allowed to pick whatever style she wanted and we dyed shoes to match. Total cost was around $90 and I did offer to help if necessary. We bought the suits for the groomsmen because we had to, we meant to get some money back for that after but it didn't happen.
