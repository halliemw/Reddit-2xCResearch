Jesus, no way would I keep using it in those circumstances!

I love my cup, but for me I can just pop it in no effort (I never even really practiced the fold), have never had a single leak, and can't feel it once it's in. I had horrible problems with leaks and such with tampons but the cup is great for me. 

But you're not me! And if it's not working for you, it just isn't. That all sounds awful and if I had those issues I'd feel the same way you do!
