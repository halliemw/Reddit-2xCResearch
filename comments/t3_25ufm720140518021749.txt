Do you really think that offering them your pity will mean anything? All of this feeling sorry for other viewpoints is just a little elitist. Being a feminist is right *for me*. The red pill women sub has posters that feel just as sorry for some of the twox posters feel for them. I don't honestly think I am in a position to offer pity to someone just because I disagree with them. Compassion and pity are two different things. Don't confuse them. My goal is to understand other people as human beings with their own thoughts and actions, not pity someone because I think they are pathetic.

EDIT: This post of yours will actually reaffirm the view that women are horrible. You're basically imying anyone with a misogynistic attitide is pitiable or pathetic.
