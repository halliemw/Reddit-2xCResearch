I feel like every time that I see a menopause ad on TV I feel like I have most of the symptoms they list. They are so vague they can apply to almost anyone. But the frequency of your period is a real symptom. Go to a doctor. And I personally would ask them to check ALL of your hormone levels along with whatever else that they advise. Just FYI, they will most likely want to put you on BC to normalize your cycle and possibly help with acne.
