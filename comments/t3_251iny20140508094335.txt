This is something I find hard to negotiate in relationships, too. 


When someone monumentally screws up, you lose trust in the person because they have demonstrated that they cannot hold up their end of your relationship agreement (whatever that was), but they express remorse and apologize and promise to make things better. 


So what do you do? If you give them a chance, you're upset and your trust in them is low. Conventional wisdom says that you must eventually forgive, because a relationship cannot exist if you're holding someone's misdeeds above their head. But, on the other hand, how long can you expect someone to prove that they won't do it again? How long should it take to rebuild trust? What happens if they slip again, even if it's not major?


At what point does it make sense to break up because you feel like this misdeed is always going to cause mistrust?


I'm sorry that I'm no help in terms of "here's how", but I know that this general topic is something I've puzzled over.
