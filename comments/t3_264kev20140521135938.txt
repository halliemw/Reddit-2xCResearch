allowing people to wear whatever they want has the potential to be hugely problematic.

No solution to anything is 100% positive, and I'm sorry you had a shitty time of it, but it really does sound like your school just had a crappy uniform/policy.

I get people being different shapes and sizes, but don't clothes come in different shapes and sizes as well?
