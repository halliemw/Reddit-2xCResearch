I get where you're coming from - I've been on the receiving end of some serious nastiness because of a feminist blog post I wrote that went pretty viral. Some guy emailed me and called me all kinds of charming names ("fat cock gobbling troglodite [sic]" comes to mind), posted my picture all over an online forum, invited other guys to rape me, etc. I was petrified someone was going to track me down and actually try to harm me. I very nearly deleted every online presence I have.  

But then I realized that they only win if I let them. And so I ignored him, and I wrote a follow up post. I didn't sink to their level of engaging with them in their space - instead I kicked their nastiness out of mine. The internet is plenty big enough for all of us, we just have to consistently and persistently relegate the trolls of the world back to their dark little corners of it.
