As a former server in the north, I can say I called everyone ma'am and everyone sir.  Yes, that includes the 5 years olds who were ordering at my tables.  I moved a little south, and that was the first time I encountered women who felt I was calling them old.  I had no idea age was related to it.  I was raised to call everyone ma'am (maybe because as a child, people were usually older than me).  I never made the switch.  
The only time I can remember using Miss was as an honorific before someone's last name.  Miss Smith, Miss Jones.  By the time I got to high school though, everyone was Ms. - Ms. Vu, Ms. Chen, etc.
