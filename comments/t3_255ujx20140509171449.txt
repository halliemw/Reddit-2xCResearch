Just because you have a migraine with your period ONCE does not mean you have catamenial migraines; there's this thing called a coincidence... Just so everyone is clear on that.

I can't help you with advice because my migraines needed prophylactic treatment (you can't stop them once they start) but /r/migraine is full of people and past posts that may have useful tips.
