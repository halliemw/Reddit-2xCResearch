What is happening to you specifically? Are you speaking in terms that don't include things that involve you because that's your way of talking? 

It is certainly bad if he's creating a toxic environment for others but there should be something directed towards you alone for this to be something that you take on. 

Harassment is taken very seriously. It can break up companies, result in many millions of dollars of losses over just one mild incident. People relocate, key personnel move out of positions, work groups dissolve. This can happen for things that are simple misunderstandings of who-said-what with the "guilty party" 100% un-involved. 

Even if its indirect harassment it actually has to happen to you. It has to be something you observe directly or impacts a situation you are involved in. If someone is telling you stories of things that happened when they're out tail-gating talking about someone else that's starting to be you making indirect harassment by re-quoting private events in the workplace.
