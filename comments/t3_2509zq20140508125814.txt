I don't care to have this conversation because I didn't comment to discuss the use of down voting or dissenting opinions. My concerns are about the lack of intersectionality and respect for POC I've seen in this sub. If you think you are silenced for disagreeing, then put yourself in the shoes of WOC who are silenced simply for having differing experiences and speaking out again racism.
