Positive body image/health and nutrition is great! Possibly some about how to stay healthy through exercise. I think proper sex education would be nice but it seems unlikely. Something to get the girls involved (If you're a woman) is maybe have a makeup day and show how to put on makeup and how less is more. I know I caked the makeup on as a kid.
