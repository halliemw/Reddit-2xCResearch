Yes, I take them continuously and have for a few years. I never take the week off, because I take them because I get horrible menstrual migraines. 

It's super convenient, I haven't had any spotting or anything, and no more period underwear, and I never run out of tampons. Really, it's the best decision I ever made (and by that I mean, my doctor suggested it). Around two years ago I accidentally got my period when I forgot my bc when I was traveling for a week, but I've never gotten my period if I missed less than 4 days in a row. (and since at the moment, I'm not using my pills as bc, that doesn't cause another sort of problem all together for me)

You don't even have to get any special bc, I take regular old pills, just skip the last 4 in the pack and go straight to the next month, no muss, no fuss.
ETA: Obviously, you should discuss with your doctor and not just start taking it continuously.
