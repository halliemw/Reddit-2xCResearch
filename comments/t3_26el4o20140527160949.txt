>Autism is a mental illness.

Feel free to pretend like you're not implying that he killed people because he's autistic.

Your statement was that he wasn't mentally stable.

Your follow up defense was that autism is a mental illness.

So you're either making random, unconnected statements, or you're arguing that he killed people because he's autistic.

So either learn to be coherent when you communicate, or learn about autism.
