I made my statement assuming you'd been seeing a gyno for ~10 years. That's still an average of 1 new doctor every 2 years, which is a lot of turnover when it comes to something permanent and life changing like (elective) surgery. 

Granted, it is a little different if you're seeing several doctors within the same practice, but still. You can pretty much just forget the time from 13-17 -- I don't know any doctor who would even seriously entertain the idea of sterilizing a minor, it's not even a thought/concern at that age. 

So in the past 5 years that you've been an adult, you've seen at least 3 doctors (whoever you saw at the 1st practice, plus your uni docs). That's just not long enough to establish a serious rapport with a physician and allow them to get to know you well enough to feel comfortable taking a risk on elective surgery, controversial surgery no less. I had been seeing my PCP group for 20 years for sinus problems before I got my specialist referral and he was still uncomfortable doing surgery because HE hadn't been personally caring for me long enough. Docs always, always, ALWAYS want to try less invasive, less permanent methods with fewer complications if at all possible. If those don't work out for you, THEN they'll move to the next step. 

I'm not trying to be unsympathetic, just trying to explain the physician's rationale a bit. Try Nexplanon/Implanon in the mean time -- it lasts 3 years and is **more** effective than tubal ligation. Good luck.
