Now click "Max", Keller was given the job in 2003 when the stock was $45 a share with regular dividends. Just because it recovered somewhat (to 14 dollars) doesn't mean the company is in a position to party like it is 2003 again. Hell the stock increase is likely a direct result of downsizing and salary shrinking. 

I'm not saying the NYT is going to die anytime soon, or that the old editor who presided on a massive loss of money deserved his pay, just that it is sensible that they wouldn't be tossing out executive compensation like they used to, hell I bet they were glad when they could stop paying Keller his inflated salary.

Edit: Here she is buying out her fellow well paid editor's contracts in a round of layoffs and pink slips http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2013/01/7265622/new-york-times-2013-buyouts-and-layoffs-watch

And here she is talking about the financial situation of it...

>"Some of the top jobs in the newsroom we sort of could no longer afford," she said. "They're great people, they're incredibly talented, they're Times people to the core, they do have amazing institutional memory, but in some ways, they were editors of editors. We just had a lot of layers ... that's just an extra layer that we can't afford."

So she _Just_ fired a bunch of her coworkers, it was so "painful" for her... but then wanted as much money as they were paying the 2003 editor back when they were a much larger organization. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/jill-abramson-ny-times-buyouts_n_2725971.html
