I really get how you're feeling. I was in similar circumstances around seven years ago. I'm really sorry that you feel shitty and are feeling regret. I'm sorry you felt societal pressures to make a certain decision. I hope, if you're faced with a decision similar to this, or as in important to you as this, you will follow your gut and go with what you feel is right for you.

However, I want to encourage you, to not hold onto guilt and feelings of regret. I understand wishing we could change the past, but, I also feel like you're grieving for a loss. Try not to look at any emotions forever, especially shitty ones. Life is forward, it's okay to forgive yourself.
