IME, plastic applicators are pretty much the same from brand to brand in terms of ease of use.  When I was a kid there were cardboard ones that didn't cover the top of the tampon: those were really hard to use, so if they still exist, avoid them.  Regardless of the brand you use, lube is the great equalizer.  If your having trouble, slather the applicator with it.  

TSS is very rare these days because tampon manufacturers have to limit how absorbent their products are.  If you're worried, stick to regular or light absorbency tampons and change them more frequently.  

You can also try a menstrual cup if the idea of tampons is just too uncomfortable.  No risk of TSS, and because the material isn't absorbent, it doesn't "tack" to your vaginal walls the way a cotton tampon sometimes does.
