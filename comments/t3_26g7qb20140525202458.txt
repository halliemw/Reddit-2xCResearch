I literally thought that all the jokes about PMS were a horrible misogynist myth. Until I started taking the pill and became a total fucking nightmare on the Tuesday of the placebo pills every month. And then I got used to the hormones I guess and I'm back to my un-PMS-y self. Except now I'm very sympathetic to gals having a rough period. That shit is real and sometimes it feels like the world is ending.
