Whether or not you're the best of the best isn't gong to be determined by your gender.  It's determined by how hard you work your ass off and how bad you want it.  Study hard.  Go to office hours.  Set the curve on exams, don't rely on it to save you.  Go to office hours (yes, this is intentionally written twice; no matter where your scores put you in the class having a working relationship with your professor will show them that you care about the material and improving your understanding of the subject.....also, you may need a reference in the future) If you feel yourself slipping, make sure to ask for help because no one is going to throw you a rope. If you want your classmates to respect your knowledge, be active in discussions or join study groups so that your peers know that you know your stuff.

Most of all:  NO EXCUSES!  It's college and no one is going to hand anything to you.  You've got to earn it.  There is no reason why you can't be the best of the best.  Don't go in with the mentality that your not capable of being top of the class, because then you'll start settling. And that's on you, no one else.

You can do it! No excuses!
