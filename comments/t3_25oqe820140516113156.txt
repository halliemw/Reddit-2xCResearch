I am a transexual woman, and one of the more horrifying realities of life as a woman is finding out about the number of women who have been raped or sexually assaulted.  One of the ways I knew that I was being accepted as one of the women is when I started to hear these stories.  It shocked me.  I had a job not to long ago, where almost every single woman in my department had been raped or assaulted.  

Rape and sexual assault happens.  A LOT.

Thankfully I have not (yet) been assaulted, or raped, but I have on multiple occasions been followed and harassed.

I used to be one of those guys who was really hurt and upset that women found me threatening.  I understood it (I thought) but it still bothered me.  Now I am one of those women who walk to the other side of the street when I see a guy, and I am walking alone.  That sucks too - because I know what I am doing to him, I have live it, I have experienced it, and it DOES suck.  But I am more afraid of what he will do to me if I don't keep my distance.

Men simply don't understand how prevalent this is.  We don't tell them the stories.  It isn't really safe to tell the stories.
