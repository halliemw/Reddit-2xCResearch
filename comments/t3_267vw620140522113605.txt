By gifts, I mean full on periods. I was told to give it 3- 6 months and then my periods will stop but it is terrible when I get periods 3 times a month. Before I went on BC, my period lasted two days! I like the fact that I don't have to take pills and it's good for three years. I am thinking of changing to a different birth control but I am not sure which one yet. You should try it, hopefully your body responds to it better than mine did. If you don't mind me asking, how was your skin before you were on Progesterone-only birth control? I am looking into it.
