I wish people spoke about their good marriages more. I'm basing life decisions on the fear that my (future?) marriage is going to go tits up, as if it's an inevitability. I want to hear from happy people, happy couples, couples who have survived shit and toddlers and death in the family and moving states and temptations to cheat, and come out the other side still holding hands. 

I want inspiration on how to build a lasting relationship, rather than stories of terrible ones. 

EDIT: I made a [**thread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24rmit/serious_whats_your_story_of_your_happy_marriage/), but no-one is answering. I guess there aren't any good stories to share :/
