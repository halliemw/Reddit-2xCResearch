The article refers to "sexual assault," "rape" and "sexual harrassment" seemingly interchangably in the first few paragraphs--it would not be intuitive to me that dress would matter to predators equally in all of such situations.  Also, provocative clothing might correlate to a higher expected level of impairment in situations involving alcohol, meaning easier prey from the predator's viewpoint.  "Might" only--not claiming knowledge on this, only asking.
