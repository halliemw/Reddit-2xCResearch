>He also started yelling at me and saying that we wouldn't have this problem if I wasn't so awful at blowjobs.

Whoa, whoa whoa. That is out of line. My eyebrows hit the ceiling and kept going.

I know guys like blowjobs. I'm one of the women who likes giving them, but not everyone does. And there is a skill set we have to learn. To get better at blowjobs, you need two things: a patient partner, and a liking for the smell/touch/taste aspects (whether your partner is condom-clad or bare, these things apply).

He doesn't sound particularly patient, and it doesn't sound like you were highly thrilled giving them, so he should have talked you through the basics of touching him first. I agree, he sounds like a bad boyfriend; you should find a support group or a therapist, if you can; and you need at least a separation for a while, if not to fully break up, because you need some time away from what's already a toxic situation.
