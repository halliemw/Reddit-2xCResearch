Ditto. I've had short hair for most of my life, but I "experimented" for a while when I was in college and grew my hair out to about the middle of my back. It's blonde, thick, and wavy in that is usually only  seen on a 1980's fantasy novel cover. I used to have men shout at me as they drove by in their trucks and guys seemed to think that if I made eye contact, it's because I wanted "the D."  Thankfully, that's all changed. 

I got tired of my long hair during my last summer in college and decided to go back to short hair. Things changed instantly - and in ways I wasn't even expecting. People seemed to assume that I was trying to make a statement, like I was coming out of the closet or something (because apparently sexual orientation has a direct correlation with hair length).  Some people who were normally nice to me suddenly became standoffish. But most importantly, the catcalls stopped and I no longer worried that some guy was going to see me in shorts and take that to be an invitation. 

Hilariously enough, I sometimes get mistaken for a gay guy (though not as often as I used to) and my boyfriend and I look like the happiest, bravest gay couple the swampy south has ever seen. 

tl;dr : When living in the south in the he U.S., long hair = harassment from dudes who think I am obligated to worship their penis. Short hair = free drinks at the gay bar, curious glances, and greater overall comfort.
