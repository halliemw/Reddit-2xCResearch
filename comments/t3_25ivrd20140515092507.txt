No need to apologize. I really appreciate you sharing your story. A lot of times I think people like to think that it would never happen to them because they "have more respect than to put up with it" or because they're "smart enough to know how to choose a good partner". But I think that in many if not most cases, it escalates very subtly like you said and is very hard to escape from.  It's so scary for me to think about how it could happen to anyone. I hope you're out of that situation now. I'm glad that you at least are able to recognize how wrong he is.
