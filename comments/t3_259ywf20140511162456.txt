I have an acquaintance who you would never believe could be a doormat. This chick is loud and out there and in your face with who she is and all that attitude that comes with it. But she wanted a big fancy expensive wedding and couldn't pay for it herself. Other than the decor and the groom, she had very little control over her wedding. Which, evidently, was ok by her since she could have opted for smaller/cheaper on her own.
