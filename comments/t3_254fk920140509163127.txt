Eh, I'd argue that most those sets are FAR more interesting than Goldiblox.

And I don't have an issue with them either, some toys are going to be marketed to boys, some toys are going to be marketed to girls, and some toys are going to be gender neutral. Its when parents aren't giving their kid a nice balance and variety so they can discover their preferences for themselves that these things become an issue.
