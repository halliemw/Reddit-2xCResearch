I don't think her comment deserved such a snarky response honestly. I didn't see her defending him in the above post, she posed a question about the context, it sounds to me like you're using a previous bias based on her previous posts to completely negate her contribution to this story. I realize your response wasn't meant to be clever, it was meant to be mean and dismissive.
