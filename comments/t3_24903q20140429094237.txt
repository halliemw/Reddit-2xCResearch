If your insurance has you paying a copay, go to your doctor and have them write a Letter of Medical Necessity.  Send that to your insurer.  It works!  I use Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo (which has no generic) because it is one of the only ones that doesn't make me ill.  I was paying $60 copay per month.  I sent in my letter last month and this month?  $0!
