Maybe he was trying to reach out by inviting me to go to lunch, I just couldn't go knowing that I might start crying because I want to hold him. I had mentioned this event for a long time. I even invited him to it says before but he said he didn't want to go. I told him, he didn't have to go If he didn't want to -maybe he misunderstood me and thought I meant "I didn't have to go..?" I don't know. In any case, I'm upset that he is making me cry and feel bad over something I had planned and then completely neglecting to tell me that there was a lunch date planned.
