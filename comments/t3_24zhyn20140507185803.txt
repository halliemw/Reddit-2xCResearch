I have barely any relationship with my dad - so I can tell you what not to do!

1. Don't be an arsehole. 

That's it.

My early memories of my dad are of him and my mum fighting, and my mum sobbing after he had stormed out of the room.  
  He would make 'jokes' about how ugly women should be made to stay indoors until it was dark, because they cause car crashes.  
When he and my mum divorced, he moved halfway across the world (a 12 hour flight) and although he came to see us frequently he would be unreliable, sometimes embarrassingly so. (He once rang the school to get them to delay an assembly for him because his flight was delayed, and the head teacher announced that to the whole school.)  
He didn't respect boundaries in most cases - he would tickle me until I managed to fight him off, and then tell me off for hitting/kicking/scratching him.

As i got older, it seems like his idea of being supportive was to either tease me about something I was self conscious about or to lecture me on how to be better in a removed and disapproving tone. He has repeatedly forced conversations on issues that I was not ready to discuss with him, and took it personally when I told him that I wasn't comfortable with the conversation.

If I had to sum it up: show up, be present, and be respectful. She's your daughter, but she's her own person. Let her show you who she is, rather than telling her who you think she is.
