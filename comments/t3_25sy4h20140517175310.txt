Ok, this is unpopular. I minored in gender studies and have openly identified ad feminist since I was like 16. 

I get what you are staying and you are right that or value shouldn't be tired to appearance.
It shouldn't be tied to our vocational skills, our jobs, our STEM degrees, or our bank accounts.

It should be tied to how much happiness and joy we share and what we do to help others. 

The ads are missing the mark, but so is celebrating being good at math.  Because honestly, if life is about finding happiness, doing a perfect wing makes me happier than doing my taxes.
