> But she also expects me to do EVERYTHING for her, and then insults me constantly, puts me down, makes me feel bad for my very existence, and then expects me to love her and praise her.

How would she react to you standing up to her? Like if she insults you, you calmly and unemotionally tell her that it hurts your feelings and that you don't want her to say that to you again? Repeatedly, without threatening to abandon the relationship you have (might be a trigger for her)? Will that work? She's pretty dependant on you, it seems to me that you have the power to dictate how the relationship works.
