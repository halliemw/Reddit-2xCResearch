I'm in a pretty similar situation as it stands. My father has been so neglectful over the years with various girlfriends, but particularly in the last 5 years of my life whilst with his long term girlfriend He has been the most hurtful and cruel. 

Now I'm 21, He wants to be back in my life after choosing to abandon me at 18. 

Last week I finally wrote a letter containing all my feelings about our relationship and the way he has treated me over the years that I could never talk to him about. I want to finally take the reins of this situation and cut him off. I'm sick of being hurt and let down by him, and now as an adult I have the opportunity to do so.

But I can't bring myself to break his heart, even though he's continuously broken mine again and again over the years.

I think the only way to feel better about it is to take the situation into your own hands and be the one in control of calling the shots.
