That's been my go to response for sexually abusive assholes for years now. I'm definitely gonna grab my junk next time though. 

My favorite non verbal response is to make a gesture with my fingers that implies they have a tiny dick. Like I'm holding a jelly bean between my fingers, then I look toward their crotch and make a sad face. Sort of saying I know your compensating for how unsatisfying you are to women
