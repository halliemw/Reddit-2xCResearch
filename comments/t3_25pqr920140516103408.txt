These steps have been taken and not taken seriously. She did ask for a reevaluation of her job position and got zero results. 

It's not because she's in charge of less people, there's smaller departments that make more. She's been very thorough with looking at why. Most of the others have been evaluated and reevaluated, but not hers, and she's been in that position for over 20 years. Part of it is that she's not been aggressive about it previously, but there's people causing her problems, and making her want to be more assertive. IF it is worth it. 

She's afraid that the only way to get any results is to take it to legal and yes, she believes that would risk her job.
