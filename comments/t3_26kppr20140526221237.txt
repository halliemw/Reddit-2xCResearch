It can ALWAYS be worse. No matter what happens, there's always something that could have gone worse. That doesn't make things not bad. Kind of like... if you get stabbed, that's not as bad as being beheaded, but it's still terrible. What he did was totally assault, it does not matter one iota what else he *could* have done that would have been worse.
