I believe this is emotional abuse. He is trying to hurt you and make you feel like you aren't good enough so you will stay and it makes him feel powerful. I wouldn't stay. I was in a relationship like that for four years and it caused so much pain and heartache.
 If you do stay- get therapy! It will help you realize that you are a rockstar. Let him know you WILL NOT be treated that way. You are a human being, you are important, and you are special. He better fucking treat you that way. 

Or leave, I KNOW being single is better than that, but I bet there is a guy out there that will treat you with the respect you absolutely deserve.
