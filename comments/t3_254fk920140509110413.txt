Thanks, and yeah, I didn't write that Barbie off, in fact because you could draw on it I did get her one in the end! But normally for the storytelling side, I get her Playmobil Friends... she loves it. Let's just say I have some issues with some of the branding happening around Barbie as a 'standards-conforming beauty doll'. I'm father to a son, but if I had a daughter I'd try to show her all the cool stuff in the world, including engineering-oriented toys, and find the Barbie brand a very limiting theme to be wrapped in.
