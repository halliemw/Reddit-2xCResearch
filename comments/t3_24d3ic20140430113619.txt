Tell your GP that if he doesn't start taking your concerns seriously, you will be going to see another doctor. Your mother was diagnosed when she was only 7 years older than you are now, and even then it was diagnosed too late.

Also, you don't *need* him to get a mammogram, it may seem. There are mammogram facilities where you don't need a referral. Here is [FDA](http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/MammographyQualityStandardsActandProgram/ConsumerInformation/ucm113968.htm) information on it.

Also, your OB can order one, too.
