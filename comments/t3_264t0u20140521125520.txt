Honey it is completely okay to be afraid and anxious and scared. I went through something similar but found out my short term "boyfriend" had been sleeping around with questionable people (as if sleeping around wasn't already questionable enough) I completely freaked out. I thought I saw symptoms that weren't  anything but my body being stressed out and reacting. I came back okay with everything and moved on. 

Just take a few deep breaths and keep yourself distracted. Go for a bike ride, read a good book, hang out with your friends. It will all be alright, you'll see.
