The thing with the opening example - the kid is missing a parent because dad "gets in the way." How is that fair to the child? Carl is still the father, whether they were married or not.

She's a single parent, how does that translate to she's better off single forever? She shouldn't be void of a meaningful relationship because she had a child with a loser. And it's not any easier for her just because they never got married. 

And their solution is to increase jobs for men? Give me a fucking break!

This is complete garbage.
