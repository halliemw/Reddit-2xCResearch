Oh! -- and about the labor and delivery, that shit is terrifying beforehand, but once it starts happening you'll be amazed at your womanly brute strength.  That's what our bodies are for, bitches have been doing it since the beginning.  Your body will totally go back as long as you make healthy choices.  Also, I think sex is better after pushing that thing out!

If you do keep it, if it is at all possible for you, breastfeed that baby!!
