I'm.so sorry for what you went through. And I'm happy to hear you are getting the help that's best for you. 

The extra weird thing to me is that all this time that he was being abusive, I didn't know. I really didn't. Because when I look back now, knowing he wasn't actually in love with me, I see it so differently. And before he told me that, as we were having problems, I saw it as our both our responsibility. I was not in treatment or on medication for my mental illnesses so I know I wasn't always doing the best thing for our relationship. 

But to know that he fell out of love with me so much earlier than that...
