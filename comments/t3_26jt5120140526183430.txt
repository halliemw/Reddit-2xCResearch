I disagree, as someone who travels solo to Mexico often there are certain hot spots you want to avoid.  

The border states are particularly dangerous.  Most of the rest of the country is fairly safe to travel in. 

http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html is a good resource as it will give state by state conditions.
