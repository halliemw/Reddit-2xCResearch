Why are any of those questions relevant? Everyone has the basic right to not be raped. How easy or hard it is to do so is irrelevant; it's not less of a violation if it is "easier".

If I meet you I don't have any right to force you to do something against your will, be it sex or bank robbery or anything. In the same way, OP (and everyone else) has the right to go out and not be forced to do anything against her will.
