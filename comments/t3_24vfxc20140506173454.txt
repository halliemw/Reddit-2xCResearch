I never thought I would, but I find it really sexy. Not like a 70's sweater chest, but a little fuzz is nice. Call me weird, but I like to bury my face in his tuft if chest hair right in between his pecs and kiss him there. Other body hair is just sort of neutral for me. My guys got some butt hair and I noticed, but I really don't care (I even kind of like it in a weird way). But I also find a hint of sweat or BO sexy, so I'm no baseline for any kind of universal standard.
