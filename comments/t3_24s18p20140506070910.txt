This entire worldview you're working from is unhealthy. I don't know what was said, but redditors and other anonymous internet people can be very cruel. I've had some awful PMs and angry comments calling me all sorts of things. But I'm not saying you should just talk to a random adult. Talk to an adult who really cares about you, like your parents or a school counselor. Yeah, you decided cutting wasn't for you, but there are so many other terrible coping mechanisms to turn to that it's better to get some help making sure you develop good and healthy ones than to stumble through life with destructive ones.
