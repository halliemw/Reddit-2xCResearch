I am a little bitter over her throwing away so many years of friends with myself and our other mutual friend but at the same time I see why it's easy for someone like her with a lot of insecurity could get sucked in so easily. It'll be even harder for her to leave him now that she has pushed away all friends but I like to think she'll reach out to me if she needs help.
