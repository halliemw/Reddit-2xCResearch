You may be satisfying his sexual needs but kinks are kind of different. I love my husband and I always get pleasure when we have sex but there are some things that give me more please such as my hands being tied, domination, a small amount of pain. My husband is naturally worried about hurting me and my emotional state if he were to talk down to me so we hardly ever include these things but a few times he has indulged me and it was amazing. 

Just because the sex isn't 120% every time doesn't mean that he doesn't satisfy me every time.
