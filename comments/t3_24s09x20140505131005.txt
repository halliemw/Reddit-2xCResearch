> Society teaches us that "real rape" is perpetrated by a stranger. However, statistics show that most victims know their perpetrator. Acquaintance, date, and spousal rape is dramatically more prevalent than stranger rape. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82% of the victims were raped by someone they knew. The Department of Justice also found that among victims 18 to 29 years old, two-thirds had a prior relationship with the rapist.

You're claiming that the vast majority of rapists are hardened criminals as opposed to personal acquaintances of the victims.
