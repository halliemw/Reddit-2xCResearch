When I say this, I don't mean that any contact with an cop qualifies as pestering them.  For example, I've heard of victim's families calling the officer, tricking someone into giving them their personal cell number, calling them at home and screaming at them, or in one extreme case, a mother managed to find out the identity of the forensic analyst who had worked a case, and continually try to trick people into getting her in touch with them so that she could accuse them of a cover up, make threats, etc.  

You can get a lot more out of people if you are just respectful toward them.  That isn't just something that applies in this case, but in all cases.  With issues as sensitive as this though, it is all too easy for people to let their emotions take control and end up making far less progress in the end.
