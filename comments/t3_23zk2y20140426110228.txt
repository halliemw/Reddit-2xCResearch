It is always scary when the rug gets pulled out from under us- we end up having to re-examine everything. I'm finding lately that this can happen in lots of areas, not just our love lives. :/

I don't think you necessarily need to label yourself before going after this girl, but you really should spend a little time deciding if you really want to try something, or leave it as a crush. 
Normally, I'd say, "go for it and figure it out on the way," but you mentioned this girl was a co-worker, which adds another level of complexity to the situation.

As far as figuring out if she'd be interested, my love life would be way more exciting if I had an answer for you there.  I'd suggest a 'friend-date' to put the feelers out. Like, lunch on a weekday, or a free concert or something. Something that's not really romantic, but will give you a chance to talk.

Good luck! ;D
