Except that 99% of Reddit isn't very specifically gendered, so of course you wouldn't see it. Look at all the AskReddit posts geared towards men, or some of the other gendered posts ([this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/25snz1/women_have_the_power/) on /r/funny right now for example) and you'll see a lot of "as a woman". Sometimes identifying yourself as coming from a different perspective is incredibly helpful. I've seen some comments here that start out with "I'm a man so I can't completely understand but here's my input" and somehow people interpret that as "mansplaining" (god I hate that word). 

I just have very, very, very rarely seen TwoX accept men at all unless they fit very specific requirements and even then it's kind of a luck of the draw. Just look at all the posts around the time of the defaulting. A lot of TwoX was *terrified* of the "men invading" because "it's already bad enough as it is" and people straight up telling men to fuck off this is our space and those posts getting lots of upvotes (agreements). Literally. Lot's of people with zero tolerance policies.

This has almost never been a very welcoming place for men. 

And yes, downvoting someone until no one can see their comment any more does count as hostility.
