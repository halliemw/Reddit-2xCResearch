That "body" doesn't get more rights than the woman by whom it is being carried. That is the crux of the issue. Pregnancy and childbirth are rough and the living, breathing woman SHOULD have the bodily autonomy to decide whether she wants to go through it or not.

Also, you say "*I* think..." Honestly, it should never be your business what a woman does with her body. Let's say a person desperately needed a kidney transplant. Do you have the right to run out onto the street and grab a random person and see if that person is a match, and then forcibly take his or her kidney because "it's okay, it won't kill him/her, there's still another one left, etc"? That would never happen, because people have bodily autonomy, and so should women. Why should women be forced to carry fetuses?
