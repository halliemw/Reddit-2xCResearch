When you respond to everything I do with complaints, it makes me feel like you don't value me and see me as just a list of flaws.  

When you told everyone that you asked me to marry you because you figured it was time to "shit or get off the pot", it made me feel like you were marrying me because you felt like you were obligated to and not because you actually loved me and appreciated me.  

When you respond to my sadness, anxiety, and anger by being annoyed that you have to deal with it and telling me I'm just making things up or don't understand, it makes me feel like my feelings aren't valid and I deserve to be treated poorly.  

When you call me a selfish bitch because I had to stop once when we were having sex, it makes me feel like I'm worth nothing more than what I can give to you.

And finally, one to my friends and family:  When you listen to me talk about my problems and frustrations and tell me how proud of me you are for having the courage and strength to leave my husband, it makes me finally feel like I have worth and deserve to be with someone who treats me that way.
