That's not true.

I'm happy with my body. Is this a thing? Do people believe every woman secretly hates herself?

I dress well to accentuate my favorite parts.

I wear makeup to accentuate my favorite facial features.

I don't wear makeup everyday and I often just wear jeans and a tee, but I don't hate my body...
