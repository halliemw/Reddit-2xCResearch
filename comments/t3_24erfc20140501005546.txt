I agree that they should promote diversity in the commercial, so good on you for suggesting that.

But if I were in your position, I would wanna get snarky. "Sure, I'll do the commercial... if you hire more women as technicians." Why let them benefit from perceived diversity when they don't even live up to it in their actual employment practices?
