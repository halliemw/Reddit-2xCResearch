Hmm...yeah...I think that's crossing a line. That would give me pause as well. I'm not sure what to suggest, since I don't know where you walk home from. If you're walking home from work, and a coworker leaves with you, then maybe you could avoid unwanted attention that way. The same would apply from a friend's place. Are the same strangers 'offering' to walk you home? What is your impression of them? Is it always someone different?  I'm just curious. It just doesn't sound normal.
