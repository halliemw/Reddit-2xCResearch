I'm not sure I agree, I certainly was not free when I was 16. Now my adolescence went pretty smooth, I had great friends, plenty of free time, secure home life etc. however,  I was completely financially dependent on my parents and I was neither emotionally nor intellectually mature enough to take advantage of the experiences life has to offer. Surely telling a teenager that: 

> As you get older those paths tend to narrow and might, depending on the choices you make disappear all together.
