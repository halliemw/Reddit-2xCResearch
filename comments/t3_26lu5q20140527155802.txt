I have found more people like me! Thank you for sharing your story and thoughts, I've been having similar feelings recently.

I started university this year so a diet of takeaways and booze for the first semester seriously gave me a kick up the arse to realise that a diet devoted to those foodstuffs just isn't sustainable. I had always and will always have chunky legs because I play a lot of field hockey, but it was starting to become more and more difficult to pass off as 'relaxed muscle'! At the beginning of my second semester I decided to not restrict what I want to eat - if I want a motherfucking brownie I will eat that baby up! I just did a bit of self loving (not in that way you pervs :P) and made a few adjustments.

Now I am by no mean 'skinny' or ultra healthy, I am just a happier person - I go to the gym maybe a couple of times a week, I play hockey and I like going for walks. I still indulge in that bottle of red wine and meat feast pizza to myself now and again, but I think I've accepted that I am never going to look like a model in a magazine, and I will never have the stamina of my friend who does a spin class every morning and an hour of circuit training every night, but I genuinely am happy.
