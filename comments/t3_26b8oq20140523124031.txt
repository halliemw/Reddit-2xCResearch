I was on tri-cyclen before I switched over to the Nuvaring and it was great! Helped A LOT with pimples and cramps, and made my flow a lot lighter. I agree with this though -- the pill is great to start on, but I find the BC I'm on now is way better. I used to have a problem with remembering to take it everyday at the same time. Now I have a Nuvaring that I change every 3 weeks, and I can easily skip my period if I want to!
