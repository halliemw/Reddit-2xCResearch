Do you use tampons at all? I know you mentioned that you were using an IUD, but if you used tampons for spotting and ..lost one up there, that may be problem. A retained tampon sometimes causes similar symptoms as a vaginal infection: odor, discharge, and a general imbalance in bacteria/pH. You can try to check for yourself, but sometimes sex pushes it too deep to reach with your fingers.
