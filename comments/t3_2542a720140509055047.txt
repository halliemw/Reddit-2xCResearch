Now that this sub is default, I'm a little more paranoid sharing my story, hence the throwaway. 

tl;dr it was horrific.

**Back Story**

Abortion is illegal in my country (Ireland). You might have heard about [Savita Halappanavar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) who died as a result of our stupid approach to abortion. 

I found out I was 3 weeks pregnant when I was 24. My boyfriend and I were in love, but hadn't yet said it, as we hadn't been going out all that long. I fell pregnant while waiting to get my period so I could insert the NuvaRing for the first time. I used the morning after pill when I realised we had unprotected sex (first time I'd ever been so stupid in 7 years of doing the nasty). I don't know why the morning after pill didn't work, but it didn't. So I waited for my period, and it never came. 

My options were... shit, to say the least. Pull together €1000, sneakily book flights to Wales or England and have the procedure done? It couldn't happen. I lived at home with my parents. I couldn't tell them because they would be so disappointed, both in my getting pregnant by a guy I was only with for 3 months, and my decision to terminate.

www.womenonweb.org was the site which gave me the chance to terminate. I donated €100, to have the pills posted to me. I had to have them sent to a PObox in Northern Ireland, because customs here would seize them. I had to wait almost 2 weeks for the pills to arrive, growing more terrified that it would cross the 8-9 week mark. With morning sickness, extra fatigue and pain (exacerbating a disorder I suffer from, for which I was taking anti-depressants and strong painkillers which definitely influenced my choice to terminate because... the foetus would already have been exposed to so much, and I don't want to bring a sick child into a very harsh world, as I know what that's like), I drove us to NI to collect the pills, and we waited another week for my parents to go on holiday for the weekend so I could take the pills.

**Upon Taking the Medication**

I did it during the night time, which was fucking stupid. Everyone said it was like bad period cramps. Fucking no.

It was excruciating pain, the worst I've ever experienced. There was blood absolutely everywhere. I was vomiting, collapsing from bloodloss or something, unable to pick myself up but still screaming in pain. At one point I was terrified, wondering if I should get him to call me an ambulance - I thought I was dying. There was so much blood, but still not enough to warrant going the hospital. Then I realised the pains were contractions. I had never realised it would be the same process as giving birth, as stupid as that sounds. And then I because thoroughly devastated. About 5 hours into the nightmare, it was easing off. I was slipping in and out of sleep, being woken by sever cramping and slipping off again. My boyfriend held me and cried and apologised over and over again, but I was glad he was there. He took good care of me, cleaning the bloody things, and just going through it with me. We are still together almost a full year later. 

It took 3-4 days for me to be able to stand up without thinking I was going to collapse again. My parents were back and I had to pretend everything was fine, but they kept asking me why I was so pale. I went to a doctor in a different county a week later to get antibiotics (womeonweb advise you to visit a doctor straight after - their advise was overall excellent and very specific, but obviously it's a last resort). She was English - and that comforted me hugely, because their attitude to abortion is just so much more practical and less judgmental (good old Catholic shame still runs rampant here). 


My therapist tells me that she has spoken to many, many post-abortion women, and that my experience was fairly traumatic compared to most. I get freaked by babies, blood, everything. I was in hysterics reading a post by a 14 year old girl in Ireland here last week, and I made the choice not to inform her of womenonweb because even though it was the right decision overall for me, I couldn't in any good conscience put a little 14 year old through that (I was relieved when I saw she was 8 weeks pregnant, as the medical option was beyond her at that point, and it eased my guilt - I was glad she told her parents, and I cried thinking of her bravery). 


So that's my absolute opposite version of abortion. I really hope that one day we can have safe options here too. Only my closest friends know about my abortion, and my boyfriend. Lots of disenfranchised grief, some regret because, well, I've always wanted to be a mother, just not when I can't support a child. I'm so glad you had a much better experience, and that you're getting on with life and accomplishing things.
