They won't arrest him. Basically, the way it works, at least in my state, is that they go to his employer and take child support right out of his paychecks. He certainly has the option to not be emotionally involved in her life, but he does not have the option to not financially support the child he helped make and I'm assuming said he wanted at the time. Do report him to the state for that, because while you aren't going to be on the streets or anything, that money could go into a college fund for her or something if you can live without it. It is after all money to help support her, and what better way to do that than by planning for her future?

That said, I also recommend not trying to get him to see her or going out of your way to allow them to bond. I know you don't want to be the reason she doesn't see her father, but you do need to be the reason she feels loved and wanted and she's never going to get that with him jumping in and out of her life on a whim.
