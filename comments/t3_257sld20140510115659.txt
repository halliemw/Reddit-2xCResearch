I don't mind it. In most cases where you dont know someone (like in a store or restaraunt) it is a polite way to address someone. But I think some women equate ma'am to being old and when you fall in the weird age range where you aren't young anymore or old (which add I get older, the age line for old keeps getting pushed back, because I'm not old right), it can feel like I'm calling you a dinosaur. Even more weird as you are still calling other ladies ma'am as well.

 It mostly weirded me out personally when I first stated working at a store at age 18 and these 16/17 year old kids would call me ma'am and I was like I'm a year older than you! But I realize they are just being polite. What else are they going to call me? Weird chick who is taking my money, yes I'll have a lovely day thank you.
