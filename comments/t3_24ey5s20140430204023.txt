I got sized as a 28D at Dillards. Which I know is wrong but it's the best I've got :( On top of that they didn't even have that size so I ended up getting a 30C.    
My boobs are asymmetrical by a couple sizes so I plan on measuring myself, buying two bras that fit each boob individually,  and stitching together some sort of frankenbra hahahah.     
Gosh, my body is wack.
