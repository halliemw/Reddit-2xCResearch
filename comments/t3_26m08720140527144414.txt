I'm not who you're replying to, but in my experience, about a week after noticing symptoms like yours, I developed a kidney infection. Whatever you decide to do now, if you develop a fever, back or side pain, and/or nausea, get to a doctor ASAP. It generally doesn't have to be the ER, but go to urgent care early the next morning if it starts at night. If you ignore it, you can land yourself in the hospital with a severe kidney infection like I did, and I don't recommend it.
