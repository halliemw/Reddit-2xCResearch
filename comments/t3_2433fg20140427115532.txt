That's happened to me so often. I don't know if my boyfriend ever notices, but usually they will put the book thing closer to him. He'll look at it and then hand it to me. He is currently unemployed, getting ready to go back to college and stays home to watch my 8-year-old son while I work and pay all the bills. I think it boggles some people's minds when I'm the one paying for dinners when we go out.
