Agreed. I'd watch men's basketball any day over women's! There's so much more potential for males in terms of strength, agility, and skill, making the game far more enjoyable to watch. It's entertaining to watch over-confident personalities push themselves to the limit on the court, and you just don't get that same level from the women's competition. I mean, it's nice to watch, but not as entertaining as men's.
