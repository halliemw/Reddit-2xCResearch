All too familiar with that situation. My ex stalks, or has someone doing it for him, my reddit account. I get messages from people, or his current about things that I haven't *told* anyone we mutually know, but he gets the info off reddit. And I've had that confirmed when I asked how someone knew about my mum passing. (I came to 2X for support)

I literally do not give a fuck about what's happening in his life, and feel no need to stalk his social media, I haven't even looked at it since we broke up. 

But on the lying thing, mine went and lied to the entire base of mutual friends we had. Who were originally *my* friends, that I introduced him too, telling people that I'd cheated on him and all this horrible shit I never did. 
And I know your feelings, girl. It sucks major balls.

Just.. best advice, don't look at his posts. Change accounts if you need to. Use RES or something to block him. I just wish you could block particular people from *seeing* your posts. The name calling is also a joke, it's just him being a douche.
