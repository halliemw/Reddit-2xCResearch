When your house has burnt down because you left the stove on, telling someone, "you should have turned the stove off" is *not* supportive. The only reason you would say that in that situation is either because you're really socially inept and don't realise how unhelpful it would be, or because you enjoy feeling superior to others and think that when your friend just suffered a disaster, that's the time to remind them that this kind of thing wouldn't have happened to you because you know better.
