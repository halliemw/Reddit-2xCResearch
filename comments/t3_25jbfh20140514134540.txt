Being called 'good girl/boy' sounds really odd to me, but so does 'good man/woman'. Just seems an odd way to say thanks. I'd probably say 'nicely done' myself.
As for the girl vs woman thing, I think there has been a lot of 'women must stay young and beautiful to be of worth' pushed into culture. Thus why you rarely see anti-wrinkle cream aimed at men. People are probably scared that your age offends you. Maybe you should tell them politely that you don't consider yourself a girl and see if it catches on?
