I left about halfway through my first eyebrow waxing- after they did the wax part but before the plucking. Fuck that noise, I was NOT ready for the pain, no one prepared me for it, and I broke down crying. And I'd had a child at that point- it did not seem worth it just to have 'nice eyebrows.'

That being said, the pain does not last a long time. It fades in about a minute. (Then it may be itchy.) If you've ever ripped off a bandaid anyplace you have hair and pulled the hairs out, it's about the same level of pain- it goes away rather quickly. I now wax my eyebrows about once a week (Age has brought on a monobrow I don't like) and I still hate it every week.
