I know what you mean. I called my dad at work, screamed at him, and when he tried to call me back, switched my phone off and ran away to the park and fed ducks for 3 hours. Reactions in these scenarios don't make sense sometimes. The only time I stopped feeling the anger was when I let it go, and realized I had my own life to worry about. It's amazing how it does feel like a literal weight off your shoulders. I'm sure you'll get there :)
