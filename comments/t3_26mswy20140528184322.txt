Yeah. I mean, if you're likening the two, I don't think there's like enough to say that these impulses are warning signals, because you don't go home and dwell about the urge to jump and generally it doesn't really interfere with social stuff (which suggests to me even more firmly that it's just a weird thing our brains do separate from all of the stuff we care about and fear and etc,) but I think it makes sense to frame both as "weird, normal impulse + fuck up in brain circuitry= weird, abnormal behavior."
