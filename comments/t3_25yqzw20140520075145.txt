> I don't like wearing make-up or accessories because I feel like total strangers on the street will think those cute things are being wasted on a fatty like me.

Yo, you totally deserve to wear makeup and beautiful clothes & accessories. Speaking as someone who is really into makeup & other fashion-related pursuits and who likes to look at and admire makeup and clothes on others, I'm not looking at your size. I am looking at how you're executing your makeup look. I have **never** thought that someone doesn't deserve to wear makeup because they're overweight.
