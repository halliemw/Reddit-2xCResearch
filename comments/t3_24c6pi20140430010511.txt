The best advice I have gotten regarding how to decide if abortion is the best course of action for you is this...  Just ask yourself, if some one had asked you before you got pregnant how you would deal with the situation, what would you have said? 

When I had an unplanned pregnancy at a young age I had an abortion, and I never regretted it.  Part of what helped me make the decision easily was that I had already made my decision before the pregnancy occurred.  

What ever your decision, just be sure that it is truly *yours* and not what someone is telling you that you are supposed to think or do.
