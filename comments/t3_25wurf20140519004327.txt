I find your issues quite interesting as my problem would be the exact opposite. Even though i am not trying and basically just hiding myself i still, somehow, connect with people easily.
Have you considered your listening skills? You talk about being a good speaker and about presenting stuff. This does not mean you are good at listening to others, which in my opinion is the most important in 1on1 situations and smaller groups.

To be a "talker", light of the party, the one running their mouth alot, you have to be goddamned funny and unembarrassed. 

For example, if you are shy and nervous while insisting on talking alot, people around you might cringe just by the fear pf stepping on your toes.
On the other hand your post doesnt really catch what might be your issue so im really just spitballin here.
