So, two things.

1)  That was not nice of him.  Most people know it's not their place to bring up someone's body.  While you shouldn't be mad at him (he did nothing wrong by asking a factual question), you sure as hell are allowed to dislike him for being the type of person that would (unless he apologizes).  If you want explanation, the real reason you're upset is..:

2)  You felt embarrassed and hurt, and that's ok.  I know; body shape and personal image are a really sensitive subject, everybody wants to be perfect and nobody is.  Even the hottest people in the world have what they are embarrassed about.  What you should do is talk to someone who you know cares about you, just so you can get some comfort and motivation, but honestly, your emotions and well-being depend on you.  I often feel alone and don't really have nice outlets (besides reddit, yay) where I can talk about things, so rather, whenever someone says something hurtful or generally makes me feel like I'm not as good as I "should" be (watch that word, no one "*should*" anything), I internalize why it's possible for them to say it, and then **I** decide whether or not it's something I need to change.  Don't let people decide what's wrong or wrong, look them in the face and say: **Don't you ever tell me how to live my life again.**  Best done with a smile.

Hope I helped.  I'm a frequent on /r/fitness.  If you have any questions shoot a PM or visit the subreddit.  You mention you diet and exercise and don't get results, perhaps you're really cheating yourself in one of those two departments.  Keep your head up, I'm sure you're beautiful in more ways than one.
