Exactly! 

In fact, I waited until I was nineteen and had been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years before I lost my virginity because I felt so worried that people would think I was slutty or "impure". 

There's such a stigma. Outside of being safe and responsible, sex is painted as this huge life-altering experience. 

I was obsessed with it being the perfect time, the perfect place, the perfect moment. If anything, I wish I would have done it SOONER and not been so terrified about it.
