Thank you for this. I didn't want to scream back to do anything that might have provoked this guy even more. I guess you could say I was afraid, but more than that, I weighed up my chances and I knew the best way forward was just to leave things as it was. 

It was nighttime and dark, my boyfriend had to go back to work, and I was definitely no match physically for this guy or any of his other scumbag friends that might have been lurking around. It makes me upset and angry that I technically did not have a choice except to back down, but I knew it was the one that would cause me the least harm. Sigh.
