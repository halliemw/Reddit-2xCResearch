Yes, thanks for looking into it.  I will check out that methodology paper if I have time. 

So, from my personal experience as someone who has been on both sides if this kind of communication, it makes sense that response rates requesting a meeting THAT day to talk about grad school would have different results.  asking for a same day interview with a busy faculty member is just lacking in common sense.  I assume that the reason the effects go away is because the emails that do get replies it's probably like "are you serious?"  

Anyway fruitful discussion, have a good one.
