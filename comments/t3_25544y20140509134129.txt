It's titled  Blurred Lines: The New Battle of the Sexes

From the website : "Kirsty Wark explores examples of how women are assailed in public life. She asks if there is a new culture in which it is acceptable to refer to women in an offensive way."


"from bomb threats sent to campaigners for more females on banknotes to sexually explicit pop videos. From extreme laddism at universities to rape jokes in the school yard... Kirsty Wark explores whether there's a new culture abroad in which it's acceptable to write about, talk about, and feature women in a sexually offensive, even abusive way. Or whether the female of the species just needs to 'man up', learn to enjoy a gag, and get used to the 21st century world."


I'll see if I can grab a transcript, if anyones interested.
