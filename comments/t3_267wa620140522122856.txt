Ironic, but here's a post on Miley using people as props that you may find interesting.... http://www.noiseporn.com/2014/04/people-arent-props-miley-cyrus-has-crossed-the-line/

I do think she's taken some things too far in her Bangerz tour. I read in a Dolly Parton interview that she thinks Miley is going over the top now to try and break away from her good-girl Disney image, and I totally think that's what she's doing. And quite frankly, I think it's sad that she has to go to such lengths to do so.
