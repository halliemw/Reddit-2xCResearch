> Who gets to decide which abortions are 'valid' and which are not? Are you going to set up some committee that gets to air out and judge the sexual history of every woman who needs an abortion and decide whether she's deserving or not?

Why would I do that? Did you read my original post? I was simply sharing how I felt, and never once did I say I would ever support legislation restricting abortions, and believe there should always be safe, and legal, options for women to have abortions. 

Just because I feel a certain way about certain circumstances involving a woman's abortion, in no way means I would prevent these women from having the choice to get one.
