Holy fucking shit, one pad per day? I'm so sorry that's horrible.

I have a kind of similar story. My parents were abusive as well and so I was NEVER comfortable talking to them about personal things like my period. Yet, one day, my mom decided that I couldn't wear disposable pads anymore and I had to wear some that she had made herself and you could wash and reuse. I FREAKED OUT because they were a lot bigger than disposable pads and I felt like everyone could see. We had a fight and to my shy horror everyone ended up hearing her yell about my period to me. She calmed down and got some sense talked into her, though, and she never did force me to wear those reusable pads.

As a side note, do you have any tips? I am 19 and finally away from my abusive household. That being said, I am completely alone and haven't been to college yet. Any advice would be nice cause I'm kind of lost right now.
