It sounds to me like pure old fashioned jealousy and an uncomfortable set up.   If you go and do what you want, you will have social repercussions which granted, you should not care about, but you have to work with these people so it does matter.

I would skip it and when asked why, you can mention that with all of the rules, it seems as though they really didn't want you to attend since they stopped short of saying, "any female 6'0 tall or in good shape need not attend."
