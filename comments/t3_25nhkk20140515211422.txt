I am working in community mental health as a prevention specialist. Basically I do in school substance abuse groups, carry a huge caseload (50+), and get paid $28,000 a year. But I love love love it. Most of us are registered interns, and our company provides free supervision so its a perk despite the pay being so low. We get a bump when we get licensed (two years in FL). Just look around, many places are happy to take registered interns because they can pay you less
