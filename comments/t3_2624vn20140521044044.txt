I agree that men also get objectified but you keep bringing up irrelevant topics. I don't care if this woman never gets asked out on dates. The point at hand is whether music critics should be judging artists in a highly technical field such as opera solely on the basis of sex appeal. Yes, sex appeal means different things for the different sexes. But I hardly think there are female critics writing negative reviews of men on the basis of their lack of income.
