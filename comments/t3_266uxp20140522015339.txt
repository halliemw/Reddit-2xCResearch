As some one who suffers from BPD it will likely never get "better".... She can learn some ways to cope, and maybe slow down the episodes...but this is a mental condition that forms when young children do not get the correct things in there life to develop emotionally.... her brain is formed incorrectly, it maybe dulled by meds but not healed. You would have to learn how to not take it personally. I often feel very shameful when I act out... to the point I no longer try and work or make any friends... I do have a boyfriend who is very understanding, but I know it takes a toll on him and makes him question if this is a forever relationship which stresses me out a lot, but there isn't much i can do. BPD is a creation of PTSD in a child's or teens brain. It is awful to deal with for others, and hard to wear for the sufferers.
