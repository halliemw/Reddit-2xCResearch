I have a little list of things I've been wanting to tell her but didn't have the lady-balls to do so. 

Such as 

1.  Your words can be viewed as harmful to other women and girls, and judging them isn't something you have the right to do
2.  You're raising victims instead of preaching to people to stop harming other

4. And lastly that you're making me ashamed of my own body, and while everyone has their insecurities, I don't want to change mine. 

I think that's all I need to cover, but any input would be great because I'm actually rather nervous to go to school in the morning.
