I had one put in almost two years ago (had to take it out - long story) and it hurt like a MOFO going in so yay - you did great! They told me to expect cramping for about 24-48hours and that's exactly as long as it lasted. I dont typically get period cramps, so it was annoying for me but it felt like that. I think the hardest part was trying to find a comfortable position to sleep. Heating pad helped relax and get comfortable but of course dont sleep with it!
