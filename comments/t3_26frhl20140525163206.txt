Teenage boys do not sexualize girls because they've been taught it's ok. They sexualize girls because thousands upon thousands of years of natural selection and evolution have conspired to encourage this sexualization.

Just like homosexual teenage boys sexualize other teenage boys whether they've been taught it's ok, or even had these impulses actually discouraged.
