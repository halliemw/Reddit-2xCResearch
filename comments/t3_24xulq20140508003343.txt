Thank you for this extremely informative comment. 

My bf and I are definitely getting more into the anal play stuff and I'm always hesitant and worried to top. I want to do it, but I don't want to hurt him.. best advice for confidence starting out? Yes, communication. That's our number one, always, but I'm still worried. 

Also, I second your believes and appreciate your inclusion of techniques... that scissoring thing sounds great, also.
