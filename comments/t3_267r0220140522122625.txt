First of all one thing that needs clearing up is the way in which the different forms of birth control tend to affect the body. The mirena contains a progestogen which can cause the nasty acne/weight gain/irregular periods/moodiness etc side effects. However the mirena has a very localised effect, when you take a mini-pill/depot or have an implant the progestogens are absorbed systemically which is why you can get so many problems with them. The mirena should have very minimal systemic effects because the hormone just doesn't get into your system in the same way. Hair thinning is unbelievably common and as you are probably thinking often due to stress. It's easy to say but you need to just stop worrying about it, there's basically nothing you can do, unless it's something like a thyroid problem or some other illness which is only something you can check with your doctor and blood tests anyway. You are more likely to develop cysts with the mirena, and they could well be causing you some of the pain. Your gynae should also have made sure it was in correctly, because it can (rarely) go into the wall of the uterus. You should have also had checks for sti's before having it put in because it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Essentially what I am very poorly trying to say is that all of the complications that can come from a mirena should have been checked for by your doctor. If the cysts are a real problem then for sure get it removed. There should be very minimal body-wide side effects from it, so have some bloods/other tests done, if they come back ok then you need to have a serious talk with your doctor about other things that could be causing your pain (i.e. stress, depression, fibromyalgia maybe for the joint pain if you don't have arthritis).
