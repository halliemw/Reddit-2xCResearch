> My daughter asked if she could have some of me to keep with her. This morning she brought down a small box and she said "This box is where I will keep you, it's fuzzy inside, like your cheeks." It broke my fucking heart.

Aaannndddd I'm crying.

I wish you and your family the best, OP.  What you're dealing with isn't easy and the fact that you're trying to look out for your wife and kids in the midst of it shows that you're probably a pretty great dude.
