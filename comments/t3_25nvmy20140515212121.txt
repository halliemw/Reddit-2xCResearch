It's relevant to an investigation, though (whether witnesses can be found who heard what happened, etc).

As long as a woman goes to the ER immediately, she can delay her report (where I live, they won't let you leave the ER until the police come and the medical personnel mediate between victim and police, I hope that doesn't go away, but I know it's not universal).
