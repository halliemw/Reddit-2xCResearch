> Not sure if anyone can relate.

I don't see why other women would not be able to relate.  We come from all walks of life.

Anyhow, little story:  My best friend always wanted to be the best housewife and mother and chose not to pursue obtaining marketable skills beyond high school. She was a great wife and wonderful mother, completely devoted to her husband and children.  

I remember many times suggesting that she learn typing (in today's equivalent, it would be learn to use MS Word or other data-entry type of skills.)  Once her children were bigger and in grammar school, she had the time during the day to do so.  I tried to convince her that she could spend 1/2 hour per day practicing her skills.  She never saw any benefit to it.  "Why would I ever need those skills?" she would ask me.

Fast forward  some years.  Husband found younger woman, left her and their two children - no child support, no health benefits for the kids, moved out of the country, just point blank left one day and screw you and the kids.

She was unable to find employment because she had no marketable skills to offer.  People are not generally inclined to to hire a middle-aged woman with no marketable skills.

It may hurt now, and of course at your level PHD you're already ahead of where my friend was, but you just never know what life will throw at you.  You never know when the rug will be pulled out from underneath you - the unexpected death of a SO, the relationship not working out, etc.

It is always better to be able to stand on your own two feet should a life-changing event happen to you.

My two-cents' worth.
