My believes that somebody can always afford a child. 

That being said, it's a different story if you don't think you're ready to raise one.  Think it over. If you have any doubts, it's not the right choice. Once you make the right choice, you will be able to justify the doubts.

Open adoptions can be fantastic. With a lawyer, you can work out something that is fair.  Raising a child is also fulfilling. It's your choice.
