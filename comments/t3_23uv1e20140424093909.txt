>Cut to three weeks later. When I spotted in Elizabeth's clothes hamper what can only be called the most hoochie-mama stripper bra I've ever seen. Shiny satin ribbing running vertically up each pitch-black cup, like fingers. Sheer black lace all around the sides. There were bows.

I think he massively overreacted, honestly.  It's a bra.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  It isn't inherently sexy, we ascribe sexiness to it.  If the daughter is comfortable wearing it, then there is no reason to have taken them away.
