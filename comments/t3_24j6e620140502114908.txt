Neat!  I looked into PMC for our rings, but got stuck because the stones I wanted wouldn't withstand the kiln (also, I didn't have a kiln).  

Your ring turned out beautifully.  Not only is it elegant, and a gift, but it was genuinely a labor of loveâ€”and it's something tangible that you can hold on to when you are far apart.

What a wonderful thing to receive!
