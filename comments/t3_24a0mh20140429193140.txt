I don't like that all the hard evidence that it was nonconsensual relies on legal arguments, and yet the lede said that she was "sexually molested." I don't like that it's sensationalistic and tells us what to think. This is horrible journalism. I am so glad I switched out of that field of study.

Also, Florida's Romeo and Juliet Law protects the boy from statutory rape anyway.
