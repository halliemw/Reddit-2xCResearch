I'm dating an older girl. I'm about to be 25 and she's 29... going to be 30 soon. We're pretty awesome together, as far as I know. In July we'll have been together for a year... Of course I think there's a lot that happens between 21 and 25. Idk if the person you're trying to date has lived much on their own or had any previous serious relationships. I moved around the country a lot with an ex and learned a lot of life lessons and did a good bit of growing up. We are both independent, support ourselves and neither of us is in school. I think that helps a lot.

Super, super happy with her!
