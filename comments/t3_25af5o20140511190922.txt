I know it's not the same but I lost my father when I was 10. I wish I could find something like this that he left me, but there isn't anything. I miss my father every day, and father's day is always hard for me like mother's day is for you. Each year seems to sting a little less but the hurt never fully goes away. My mother isn't in the best of health, she's only 54 and has already had 3 surgeries on her back. I worry about losing her all the time, especially when she has surgery. I've had a lot of friends take their parents being there for granted, you don't know how important they are in your life until they are not there anymore.
