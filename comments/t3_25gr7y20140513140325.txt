Here's the thing, HPV is one of the most prevalent STDs out there. I found out I had it when I was in my freshman year of college, and I only had had a couple partners by then. I was upset, but my doctor told me not to be, but I needed to be aware.

This means that regular yearly pap test had to happen, and I have since had two colposcopies. Both times the results were non-cancerous. And thats all they want to see, if the abnormal cells on your cervix are cancerous or not. 

It is pretty uncomfortable, like someone is pinching your insides a little, and there is some blood and cervical tissue discharge afterwards, but its better to know than not know. I would rather suffer a few minutes of uncomfortableness than let something run rampant in my body, unchecked. 

I think you need to really talk to her about it, let her know there are real risks to this, that she could get cancer, or be unable to have children down the road. Ask her to at least make an informed decision, trying to leave out the emotional factor that she obviously feels. I believe if you ask them, you can even be in the room when they do the colposcopy, its not a terribly complicated procedure, my doctor let my mom come in the first time to hold my hand. There was a sheet up so she didn't see anything she didn't want to, she was just there to keep me calm. 

Try asking her how she would feel if there was a test you could get to see if something was wrong with you, but you were refusing to get it. Her decision impacts you, too, and I don't think its a bad thing to point that out to her. You care about her and she cares about you, too, and that is where this is all coming from - from a place of love. Maybe couching the convo in these terms, and showing her some supportive messages on this subreddit will help her get the test done.
