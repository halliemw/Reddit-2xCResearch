You've brought up the thing that really shocked/scared me the most.  Based on my interactions with him prior, I could tell he was a very well spoken and smart person.  He is very far from being an idiot, which is why I thought the whole thing was that much creepier.  And that is also why I am so hesitant to address it rashly.
