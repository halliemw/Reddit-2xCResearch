I just went through a medical abortion myself. I was 6 weeks pregnant, so I still had the option for the shot. Which I went through with, and I just got done with the pills yesterday. Seeming that you are 7 weeks, you would have to go through the surgical abortion. Which is not as scary as it seems.

My boyfriend and myself had failed birth control....and through a lot of struggle with emotions and logical sense, we decided to go through with it. It's a hard choice, but, no matter which one you make, it will be the right one because YOU made it.  I also wasn't 100% going through with it....but, it was the right choice for me. I know that as a fact. 


You can PM me if you have any questions or if you would just like to talk. I can tell you more of my story if you are interested, and I would not mind if you just need to simply vent. I know it's a hard and delicate subject to talk about...it's painful for myself to talk about it to be honest. But, you're not alone.

Edit: You can also visit /r/abortion if you want to talk to people there too. I talked to people there who both did go through with it and did not before making my decision. I can also provide you with sites where you can talk to a consoler online.
