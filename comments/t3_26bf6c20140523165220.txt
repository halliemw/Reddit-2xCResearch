Do you assume that I assume that every guy is a prick who will sexually assault me every chance they get? 

When I say *sooner or later*, I'm not trying to imply that all men are dirty sex beasts who can't help themselves around women. They're not. *Sooner or later* means there's a chance that someday, I'll be on a crowded train when someone decides to put their hands on my rear. *Sooner or later* means there's a chance that someday, I'll be at a party or a nightclub or a bar and I'll encounter someone who won't take no for an answer. *Sooner or later* means there's a chance that someday, I'll encounter someone who feels they have the right to put their hands on my body without my permission. 

And I never said I was expecting a man to do this, either. A woman could do it too and it would be just as unacceptable.
