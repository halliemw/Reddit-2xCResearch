Stay away from caffeine. It may normally help, but with the amount of blood loss, you probably are getting a way higher concentration than you should. Drink a lot of water. Consider going to urgent care if you can- passing out is no joke. If you're not feeling up to eating, try an instant breakfast (chocolate is yummy, especially if you put chocolate syrup in it too). You need to get some calories in, especially protein, and you need to replenish your vitamins/minerals/electrolytes. A daily vitamin and sports drinks probably wouldn't hurt.

Please update!
