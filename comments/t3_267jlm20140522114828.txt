Actually, I'd venture to say this is REALLY bad advice.  If this guy is in a spiral like this, there's a reason for it.  More often than not, the church will encourage behaviour like this; I'd put $ that this church is an evangelical protestant church, and they will be VERY likely to begin to put pressure on her and even her kids.  
Before she contacts anyone, she should at the very least research the church.  Google is amazing for that.
