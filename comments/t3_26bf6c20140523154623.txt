Not really, no.  I can only speak for myself here but:
I don't take public transit.  I smile and say hi to random strangers in the street.  I talk to random strangers in the library.  I don't go to bars, I don't go to clubs.    For sexual assault I haven't put myself in a situation where it would occur.  If I'm uncomfortable with a situation for any reason I either talk about it and if talking isn't an option I leave.

I've taken control of my situations and my surroundings.  I have yet to get involved with people who don't respect my decisions in life.  I can't ask everyone to do what I've done and I can't expect that most people will experience what I have.  But I can say that I have not experienced sexual assault and I have not been the recipient (either negative or benign) or sexist behaviors that I'm aware of.  I'm not addressing people at large.  I'm answering the question of who here has not experienced this.
