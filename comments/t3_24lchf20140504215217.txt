I got a cream for it that said it goes on the outside. I have a friend who's a nurse who said that the antibiotics I was on commonly cause thrush, and she's gotten it from them herself before (but no, I did not and will not let her look at my vagina, not that she asked). Kind of wish the GP could prescribe the tablet without having to look or touch down there, but I know that's not happening. I do have an appointment for my GP on Thursday since it's the earliest appointment I could get, but it would be very nice if there was some way of dealing with it before then.
