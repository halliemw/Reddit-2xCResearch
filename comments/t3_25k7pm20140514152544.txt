>It seems obvious that she should give up the cats so she can survive.


OP, is really not like that.  For someone who has lost almost everything, like it does seem to be the case from your post, it is clear that she is living for them and taking comfort from them.  As an animal lover myself, I can tell you that some people see the separation from pets as losing family members.  Not only that, but they also see themselves as a failure for no longer being able to provide shelter for them.  My advice is that you and your dad (if you are all still on speaking terms), and maybe your siblings too, try figure a way to help her keep the cats.  Involve the family, and ask for help.  Some very decent, not at all that expensive apartments are pet friendly, at least in my area.  Look into it.  I can see how devastating that would be, if I had to give up on my pets in the middle of a divorce! Her whole world just flipped 360 degrees and she feels helpless and hopeless.  Maybe take her for a coffee and go with her trying to find a place for her to live that's affordable and pet friendly?  Maybe show her that she is not alone and that you understand what she is going through.
