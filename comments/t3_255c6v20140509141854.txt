Hey! Welcome! 

Just be your caring, non-misogynistic, almost Burt-Reynolds-chesty self! Participate where you feel moved to do so, and downvote/report assholes as you see 'em.  We make effort to be inclusive, so take special care with people whose life experience differs substantially from your own, and be respectful.  (note: culture around here skews supportive and a little goofy rather than argumentative.)

Oh, and IFF means Image Fest Friday. On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

We're glad you're here!
