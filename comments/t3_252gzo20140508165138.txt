As a publisher, I've arranged Editorial Board dinners (working dinners) where I made the reservation, chose the menu, showed up early to introduce myself and explain the nature of the dinner & request that the bill be given to me (publisher pays) at the end of the meal and wait staff STILL fucks up and gives the bill to one of the older men at the table.
