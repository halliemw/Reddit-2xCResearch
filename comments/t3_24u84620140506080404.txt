Maybe we should start debunking the myth that movies fail because of gender/race, and not because they're badly written/directed. Even if they're badly written, it shouldn't reflect on all other movies that happen to have a protagonist with the same gender/race. It sets up an unrealistic expectations of perfection for movies by 'minorities', which leads to fewer movies being produced with these types of characters. And that just perpetuates the problem. Since this is mostly a cultural problem, it should be easily discussed and overcome.
