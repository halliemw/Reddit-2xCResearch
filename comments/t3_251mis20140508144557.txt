I expected /user/froggymorning to weigh in heavily on this one, since her sexual assault investigation experience is substantial, and was dismayed to see her account deleted!  This is EXACTLY the kind of thing her legal expertise would be so helpful about.  She was one of my favorite posters in /r/TwoXChromosomes since you could count on her to relate the facts even on emotional issues.
