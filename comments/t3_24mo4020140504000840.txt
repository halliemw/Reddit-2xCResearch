You say your dad is pretty mellow most of the time. I'm not condoning living in an unhealthy environment with someone who can't regulate their emotions, but have you tried calmly discussing his anger issues when he's in a good mood? Do you think he is able to calmly and logically discuss how scary his anger is? He might think he reacts normally, or when he gets started has a hard time calming down and needs to learn techniques to help him. I work in a therapeutic center and though it may not work as well with an adult some techniques include time alone, squeezing a squishy ball, taking a bath. I know how hard it can be living with an emotionally unstable adult, but if they know how much they are hurting you, they may be willing to change.
