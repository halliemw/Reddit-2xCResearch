I never even heard that anemia and heavy period is related. I have that extreme low iron level after my breastfeeding my firstborn for an extended period of time and doing frequent blood donation. 
I got tons of iron pills along with high vitamin C stuff to build up my ferritin level. Make sure your Dr is actually keep an eye on the progress though. Many iron pills are really hard to absorb and the unabsorbed iron can cause extreme stomach issues.  First my GP gave me 200 mg pill and it was awful. I went to see a naturopath and he told me that particular iron pill have an average 10% absorbency level.  He gave me a supplement called Hemagenics. It only has 29mg iron, but have a 90% absorbency on average. 
Also told me to try to eat more red meat with high vitamin c food, and  try to space out high calcium food from the iron reach food. Somehow they interfere with each other absorption.
