Guy here.
Leave him.
I don't believe you are truly happy together. (Your username says sad girlfriend in it) If you were both happy, this thread wouldn't exist. 

I think because you have some happy times together, it overshadows his bad behavior. Just because he gave you some happy moments here and there, doesn't excuse his emotional abuse. 

I think people hold onto abusive relationships because they focus on the good times, and the fact the good times happen fewer, they are more cherished and thought about, as compared to a partner that will give them more good times than bad. 

Telling women their place isn't my idea of a joke.

Example, typical bad boy who cheats on his gf, hits on her friends, etc, but one day he picks a nice flower and gives it to his gf. That one time overshadows the bad things he has done, because this seems so great in comparison to his usual behavior. 

There are people out there who will make you happy and also not feel the need to tell you about their desires to sleep with your friends.

Edit: Or have the desire to be with anyone else other than you
