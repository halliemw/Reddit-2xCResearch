I would've loved learning about female scientists who made a difference. I know they say girls do better in math and science now in school, but I honestly don't see this with my classmates. Maybe girls do better but just don't have the confidence?  Another thing I would've loved being taught about: (I'm not so certain this is science related) but, when to start wearing a bra, how to measure yourself for a bra..
