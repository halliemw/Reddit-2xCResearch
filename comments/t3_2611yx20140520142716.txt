How are you answering the questions?

Those are typically questions people use to make polite small talk, they don't really want or expect you to give them a detailed story of your life and weekend, just a "Fine" will do.

If you *are* answering with polite small talk, then I have no idea why they're acting that way, some people just never grow out of high school.
