> The thing is I need help understanding these prejudices and one of the ways to do this is to have an attempt at articulating them. Somebody, may, for example, point to other prejudices, a different way of expressing them, contest them, etc. 

Sorry, I'm confused.  What about the prejudices do you need help understanding?  Were you trying to start a discussion on prejudices to better understand them? Or do they logically not make sense to you? Or do you think there's more to it than the ones you originally brought up and you want to know more about them?  Apologies, apparently my brain is not working today and it's making me confused about what you're saying.
