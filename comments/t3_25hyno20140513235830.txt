It hurts a little, like a pinch, not Indian rug burn. You're not afraid of the pap, you're letting your brain follow your imagination, which can only go anywhere if there's something more creative than "Pinch. Nothin wrong here." Stop your mind from following that line of thinking and change thoughts for a bit to something that serves you in this moment. And decide that if you get any different news that you will deal with it then. You are smart enough to handle it later if the need arises.
