I'm really glad you posted this because I have the exact same thing going on. My gynecologist was super worried about a lump, so I had an ultrasound, and went to a breast surgeon who said it wasn't a fibroadenoma (because there was no shadow on the image) and that it was just "dense tissue."  I felt very sore for a few days after having my ultrasound. This is probably because of my cycle and I have the joy of having cysts in one of my breasts which hurt like hell. Did any cysts show up for you? 

Your concerns are not silly at all. You have to be an advocate for your own health. Dense breast tissue is hella annoying and frustrating. You're doing the right thing by getting everything checked out and talking to your doctors. Keep your chin up!
