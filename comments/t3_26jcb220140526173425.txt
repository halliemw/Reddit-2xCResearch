Exactly.  I have no problems whatsoever with a crisis pregnancy clinic run by religious people who are UP FRONT about who they are.  I'm sure there is a need for counseling, medical care, and resources from caring people who can help girls who believe abortion is wrong.  It would be a terrifying thing to be religious and pregnant, especially if there is a strong family stigma against premarital sex.

However, doesn't it weaken the message delivered to lie to women and girls about their options?  If abortion is morally wrong then why would they need to terrify girls with made up post-abortion problems?  Wouldn't "In the religion we both adhere to abortion is wrong so lets find a different solution" be enough?!  If they have to lie, doesn't it naturally raise the question if they're lying about the moral implications of abortion too?

Gah!  I used to be pro-life when I was strongly religious, and still deeply believe that abortion is a terrible solution to a pregnancy problem.  However, I also believe that the best way to reduce the number of abortions is contraception, education, and a large reduction in the amount of shame heaped on girls who get pregnant.
