That's awesome, thank you! And makes a lot of sense. 

The only comment I made on her weight was when she pointedly said she could drink like a 300 pound guy, but didn't look 300 pounds, and I wholeheartedly agreed. But yeah I figured it was best to not draw extra attention to her weight or food, that stuff is going to be on her mind enough as is. 

I just wish I had a more permanent solution like, how to help her have a positive body image, or how to destroy our culture that encourages these dangerous standards of thin-ness.
