Nah, dude's upset that his "I don't care about periods, and you shouldn't expect anyone to either because it's sexist" initial comment was poorly received because it was a total derail from the OP's topic.

I think his logic went (**and I do not agree with it**):

* Treating someone differently only because they're a woman is sexist
* Periods are for women only
* Therefore, treating someone differently when they're on their period is sexist because you're doing it just because they're experiencing a womanly thing

When the reality is that (and I agree with the following):

* Treating someone with care when they are obviously in a great deal of pain/ill is a kind thing to do and they appreciate it
* Sometimes people end up in a great deal of pain/ill because of their periods (and those people usually identify as women, but that's irrelevant to this logic sequence)
* Therefore, someone with care when they are having a really bad time with their period is a kind thing to do and they appreciate it
