Sounds like you've heard a lot of misinformation. I [27F] have only been taking BC for three years. Whenever I am taking my pills, my breasts are slightly fuller and my body is slightly curvier, and when I am taking the "period" (no hormones) pills, my breasts become their original size and I am back to my old skinny butt self from before I ever started taking birth control at all. I use the same size bras, same size clothes, and my breasts haven't become saggy.

I was concerned about my sex drive going down which DID happen, but I went from wanting intercourse daily to every other day instead. I still find the same types of men attractive. I no longer have the rocking roller coaster of emotions right before my period, my facial blemishes are much improved, and my period is SO MUCH lighter. So, BC actually *improved* my quality of life.

**The side effects you experience - if any at all - should be minimal and if not, you'll need to find a different BC.**
