Actually, step through frames are often heavier.  They use more material to be about as stiff as a week old salad.  Good job holding firm and not letting him make you get something you didn't want.  

Though I almost bought an old Peugeot step through.  Absolute beauty, great burgundy paint.  Fenders looked brand new.  Regret not picking it up, but I was saving for a new "serious" road bike at the time.  N+1 and all.
