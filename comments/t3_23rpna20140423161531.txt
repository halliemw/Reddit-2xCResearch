Before your post and link, I had never heard of the STSS.  

Reading the questions asked in the survey I would say that I used to be the type of person that silenced myself.  I was this way since I was a child.  In fact, my siblings would call themselves the "partners in crime" while I was labeled the "dream child."  

I think that all that has changed for me because I resented having to hold so much in.  I say no more now.  I bring up difficult, uncomfortable topics with my fiance rather than just avoid confrontation.  That being said, I'm silencing myself less, but there are times when I still bite my tongue, so to speak.  

I can't tell you how to change, but in my case I learned to speak up more because I know that that's the only way my relationship is going to work (my fiance is a self silencer too).  If I don't speak up, I know he won't and then it just grows into resentment on both our parts.  Be willing to say no too.  You can't do everything.  Sometimes you do have to put yourself first, especially if you're in school.  Ask people to help if you think you need it.  For example, while in my PhD program my older sister, who is very assertive, called my parents (who were going through a divorce) and basically told them to chill out and leave me alone, especially during finals.  Or just have someone that can help remind you to take time for you.
