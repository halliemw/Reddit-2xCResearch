Truthfully I don't remember my thought process at age 13 and I don't want to read through my teen deadjournal to find out, ha. But I grew up in the 90s and from what I see from my cousins and cousin's children - today's girls *need* to know about safe internet usage!

I know that parents nowadays usually didn't grow up with the internet, so they sort of skirt on that. I think while it's important that 11-13 years old know about career paths they can take there are other things that you should focus on that are more important: 

**1) changes in your body through puberty**

It's just nice that you're totally normal.

**2) body image in today's society**

maybe look at magazines, point out that pictures are all photoshopped and people get *paid* to look good. That is their job. Maybe showcase other women that are healthy and career orientated to show them that there are plenty other jobs. Then delve into what healthy bodies look like or nutrition.

**3) internet usage**

sexting, sending underage pictures on snap chat, posting every little thing on FB might seem important now but once on the internet - always on the internet. It might seem important to be as glamorous as models or entertainers but instead of making tons of pictures go out and do something fun?

(: hope there are some good things in this wall of text for ya!
