I think the issue is that this is a dumb movie. People are trying to make important social points on a dumb movie. The title of the article itself is even bad. I would hardly call any of the women in the movie "funny actresses." Is there a larger problem, yes, there is. But this movie shouldn't be the basis for grandstanding on the point that women are underrepresented or stereotyped in film. That's like saying 'Anchorman' is unfair to men because it portrays them all as sexist womanizers. It is a dumb movie with a dumb plot, it isn't meant to make people think or to question, it is meant to get laughs from sex and fart jokes.

I can think of several movies where actually funny actresses starred in, and they were great and the topic didn't revolve only around men. Focusing on one bad movie is kind of overstating the issue.
