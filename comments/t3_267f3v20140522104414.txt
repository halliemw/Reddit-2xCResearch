>BC convinces your body it is pregnant, so a test may show inconclusive results.

That's just completely inaccurate, *dangerously* false information to be spreading around 2x. 

Folks: BC **does not** cause false positives on pregnancy tests.

The only medications that would cause a false positive on a pregnancy test would be things that contain hCG, like if you were on an hCG diet or doing fertility treatments.
