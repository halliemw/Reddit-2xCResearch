I have to disagree with the video on this point. I think the more "feminine" villains are just an attempt to do something different from the burly male comic book villains of the last century. Still, I have to ask if the villain is disturbing mainly because they have feminine traits or because they are feminine traits grafted on to a male body? Would [Him of Powerpuff Girls fame](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130517082701/powerpuff/images/7/74/HIM-pic.png) be as creepy if he was a female that acted in the exact same way? Would he be as creepy if he was a female with traditionally male traits? What does that mean for this argument? ([Video for reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhtf2P6IgqA))
