I've never gotten asked if I'm pregnant but sometimes after food I literally have a food baby. I swear it looks like I'm three months along because anything extra in my stomach area really shows. I too am naturally quite thin 0-2, but I do have thick legs (naturally, not fat, literally thick, I can feel the muscles). I think that counterbalances any food baby I get.
