My aunt has untreated BPD and it's a terrifying thing. If your fianc√©e isn't in long-term treatment, I would seriously try to encourage her to get there. Probably couples therapy as well, because you're going to need support as well.  

Unfortunately, borderlines often lack the insight necessary to recognize that they need treatment, and/or they manipulate others into thinking they don't need treatment.  

There's a great book called Stop Walking on Eggshells about living with someone with BPD - worth a read if you haven't done so already.
