Or maybe, like the majority of Industries, Women our not supported or encourage to go into or stay in these jobs. Culinary is a very demanding, hardcore job. You have to be willing to work grueling hours, weekends , holidays. You have to deal with idiotic requests, multitask on a massive level and survive Stress that others would find crippling. The Food Network makes it all look so shiny and fun. Even in Michelin star restaurants, you have to scrabble from the Bottom, Deck brushing tile floors at 2 am, after a 14 hour shift.It's a VERY Macho atmosphere. I have had to develop a Bitch persona, just for work. Especially , without other females in the kitchen , I have had to become quite aggressive. Not all women a comfortable dealing with that kind of Bullshit. You have to LOVE Culinary. It has to be a CALLING or you would hate it.
