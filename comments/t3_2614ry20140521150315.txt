Riiiight. I am really going to trust someone who links to evidence behind a paywall.

What, do you think i'm stupid enough to fall for that trick?

"In fact, while real gender differences (whether biologically based or cultural) do exist, men and women overlap psychologically more than they differ, according to a new study published in February in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology."

This was recently dis-proven after the male and female brains were analysed, which showed that the male and female brains were wired very differently, although with *some* overlap. Whilst there are similarities, the way men and women think and what each sex is attracted in terms of hobbies and interests are vastly different

"Interest and talent in science also fell along a[overlapping] continuum, despite stereotypes that men are better."

Also dis-proven by study after study. A single study does not change the fact that the majority state otherwise.
