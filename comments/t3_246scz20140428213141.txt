I really hated Gravity and thought that the role Sandra Bullock played was awful. She just like cried and panicked while the men kept it cool. I know it's ok to have women cry and panic but it just really kind of turned my stomach. What if she and george cloony had switched roles? Could you even see george cloony accepting that?
