Mmm... maybe frame it to leave the bride a graceful out, just in case? Something like, 
"Hey, Sally, I had a great time at the shower, and of course I saved the date of the wedding... now, I haven't received a formal invitation? I understand that--in this economy--maybe you couldn't invite everyone you wanted, but I wonder if you could let me know by Sunday, so that I can make my plans for that weekend?"
