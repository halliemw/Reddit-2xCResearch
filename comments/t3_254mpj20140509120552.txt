Thanks for the good thoughts for my dad. I'll be sending good thoughts your way too!  

Dad usually has too much chemo brain to read, but I have been bringing him big ol' picture books (50 years of movie history, art books, etc.) that he has been enjoying. Mostly he just wants us there with him and I'm happy to do that :)
