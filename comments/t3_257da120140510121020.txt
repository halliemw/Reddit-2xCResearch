When I met my Bf I was 28 and he was 23. I had previously only ever dated older guys and was in the habit of dismissing anyone younger than me because I was just a snob I suppose. He was very persistent and just kept calling and asking to go hiking, to movies, festivals etc... he was adorable and eventually I have in to the persistence. Despite the age difference we have a lot in common and have been together to 6 fabulous years. Age is just a number, dint let it shy you away from what could be a great relationship. If you are attracted, get along and have common interests then there is no reason to not give it a try. Age is just a number.
