You're graduating from college, and it is a pretty immature reaction to get upset about something like this.

Be glad your boyfriend values you and values his family.  He did the nice thing -- his dad was interested in seeing the same movie you guys were already going to see, so he invited his dad along.

When you get older, and perhaps have children of your own, you'll realize you would absolutely cherish it if one of them invited you along like that every once in a while.

On the other hand, of course you want to have a nice night out with your boyfriend to celebrate graduating from college.  So why not just tell your boyfriend "hey, I think it is really nice you invited your dad to come see Godzilla with us, but I still would like to have an evening alone for just the two of us to celebrate, so let's pick another night and have our own little celebration!"
