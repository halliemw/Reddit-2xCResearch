Yea, I felt weird that there was no follow up sooner than a year. I'm hoping my appointment on Saturday will give me more answers and help the stress I'm going through right now. I've just mainly been freaking out cause my cervix feels swollen and I would just like a second opinion, since I feel like my doctor didn't do much to really help at all. 
So what is displasia?
