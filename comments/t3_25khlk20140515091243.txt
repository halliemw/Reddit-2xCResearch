Lol, it hasn't happened all the time or anything.  There have been just a couple of specific instances.  The first time it happened, it was while moving a washing machine.  I used to be able to, if it was on a hand truck, get it up a flight of stairs by pulling it up one step at a time.  It was gruelingly hard, but doable.  I went to do that same thing about 9 months into transition, and I could *not* get it up even one step.  I nearly pulled something trying, but it just wasn't happening.

The second time was very recent.  The place I am staying has its own well for water, but currently it's not working due to a whole bunch of stupid reasons I won't get into.  Well, needless to say, not having running water freaking sucks.  I was trying to fix it while my boyfriend was at work, but when it came time to unscrew the big plug on top so that I could fill the pump with water and prime it, I could *not* get the thing to turn.  Not one turn.  I was putting every ounce of weight and "ooomf" into it that I could muster, but I might as well have been pushing against a brick wall.

In both cases, boyfriend gets home and gets it done with relative ease, by himself.  I try to help, but he tells me to keep back because he doesn't want me to get hurt.  Smug jerk.  ;)
