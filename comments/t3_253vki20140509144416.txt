I grew up in the south and still live there. "darling", "hon" and "sugar" are all thing men call me all the time. I HATE it so much. I'm at fucking work and you are undermining my professionalism by trying to remind me I'm just a girl. I'm sure you don't think that's what you're doing but that is what's happening. I don't give two flying fucks what the people saying it looks like either. 
Seriously please just call us miss or something less condescending.
