Oh I'm not saying there was previously nothing available, I have never claimed that. I simply bbelieve that the existence of a dedicated clinic will help many more people than GPs are current capable of helping (dues to numbers and location as much as experience). 

The fact that this clinic is in the very centre of Dublin will mean it will be able to help many women who either cannot visit or do not have a local GP, and many women from such backgrounds tend to live in Dublin or other such large cities. Also it is a prime location for women entering the country as they are likely to do so via Dublin.
