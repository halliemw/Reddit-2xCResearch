Yeah I totally get that. Plus being the Default would probably ruin this sub for you gals (just stopped in to see what some of the new default subs are like) personally I'd be so pissed if /r/NFL ended up being default for nearly the same reason, smallish closed community with our own jokes and other things with discussions and trends that would be completely crushed by the hive. Good luck girls!
