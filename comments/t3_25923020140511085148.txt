So I was in college, and I go to a Columbia frat party. Am the laziest person ever so I wear pants and haven't shaved my legs in weeks, probably. 
But since this is the norm, I, of course, completely forget about it and drink lots of vodka.

I see this guy I sort of know, am so happy I see him, we start dancing and we pretty quickly head back to his room. We're both pretty drunk and about to have a really great time. He takes off my clothes, we're fooling around, and he starts feeling up on my legs. I'm like "oh shit, people care about that sort of thing, fingers crossed hopefully he doesn't notice"

He keeps feeling up on my legs, and as we're sort of getting serious and being like "yeah you're so hot let's bang" he whispers in my ear:

"I LOVE how hairy you are."

Uhh, didn't even think I was that hairy!

I did everything I could to contain my laughter, then he proceeded to bang me like crazy.

They're out there. Hairy is beautiful. Like so many other perceived flaws, just own it and all will be well.
