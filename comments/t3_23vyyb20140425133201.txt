But that's exactly exactly the point. If the reprimand for committing violent rape is 1 year suspension then the legitimacy of that system needs to be called into question. And yes I do have a problem with being encouraged to not file with the police, I agree it's an even more egregious issue with their current system of response. I think overturning his sentence is a small drop in the bucket in order to make this woman feel safer, but I think what really needs to happen is that this case should field enough outrage to get a reform started on their policies of dealing with violent crimes.

To put it into perspective I knew a boy who was a student at BYU. He got caught stealing a dvd from the university book store and what happened to him? Two semester suspension along with mandated sessions with a school counselor, watching a series of videos on theft, and writing an essay about why his actions were wrong and how he feels he can change in the future. So his University literally has a stiffer penalty for petty theft than Brown has for *violent rape*.

Odd side note: He went to court for it as well, but wasn't convicted (he's a bit lucky that his parents are both lawyers.) I actually might ask him about because I'm curious of how it was handled. It might be more clear cut in the case of theft however, because it was the school itself levying criminal charges against him. Whereas in rape it's two private parties.
