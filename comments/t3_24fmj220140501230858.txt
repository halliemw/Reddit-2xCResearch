Thank you!!! And the only classes I'm confused about are my religion class (he gave me extra points for perfect attendance even though I missed a class period, and there were a couple quizzes I didn't do too hot on!) and my psych class (I was supposed to end up with an A- in the class, after getting 205/200 points on my final, which I was also confused about, but she put an A in on the final grade site!) but yes, I did bust my ass this semester! Thank you! I'm finally getting into my major classes so I'm super excited!
