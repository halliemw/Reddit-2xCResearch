I think some of it is because we, as a group, can't decide on what we want to be called. 

A lot of us (myself formerly included) hang onto "girl" long past our teenage years, because we don't feel like *women* yet and because youth is associated with attractiveness which is of course heavily tied to our feelings of self worth. 

Girls don't like to be called women and women don't like to be called girls. Girls are fun and cool and immature. Women have kids and boring jobs and wrinkles and life experience. 

"Lady" has connotations that not all of us embrace. It implies a certain set of behaviors. 

"Femme" sounds, well... girly. 

And of course any term can be construed to be excluding genderqueer folks. 

It's the same with titles. Men are always Mister/Mr., regardless of age or marital status. A woman can be Miss, Ms., Ma'am, Mrs... and god help you if you use the wrong one. 

So guys think they are playing it safe by calling us "females," but it really comes across as if we're another species. "Female" and "male" are best used as adjectives. Used as nouns, they will always sound clinical and awkward.

If we had a female equivalent to "guys," a casual catchall term carrying no implications of age, maturity, or behavior, I think the widespread use of "female" as a noun would cease.
