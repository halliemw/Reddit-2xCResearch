Well, when you're in a healthy relationship, you support each other when you need it :) It isn't your job to be an emotional rock every moment of every day. Your partner should be able to step in and support you when you need it.

As for when you get a job - two adults sharing a space can share the load of work. The only time I think this isn't true is if one partner works crazy hours, like 60 a week, and the other only works maybe 15 hours a week. It's all about balance - you'll find it.
