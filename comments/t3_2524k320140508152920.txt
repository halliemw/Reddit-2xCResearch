Thanks for this. I'm a guy with some close female friends, and I worry that a lot of online spaces simply don't feel safe for women. I found out about this place when it was added to the defaults, and am kinda-sorta excited by the idea that my silly hobby (redditing) might be of use to one or two of my friends when they're going through a rough time.

I mean, I get the concern. Some Redditors are simply terrible people, and this has been a safe haven for a lot of folks for a long time. But if I was able to find this place, and they were able to find this place, then lots of women who *really* need a "safe zone" will be able to find this place too. And there really aren't enough safe places like this online.

Remember to downvote and report terrible comments. If you get harassed via PM, report each and every one of them. If harassment continues, report it to the mods via PM. And if that doesn't help, then this place *will* need to be removed from the defaults. And that's a shame, because this place could really help out a lot of people.
