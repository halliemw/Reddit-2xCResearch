Thank you so much!! I'm proud of the work I've put into my cosplays and I keep adding more to my "to do" list. Both Bulma and Lara Croft are my favorites, and someone actually thought I was hurt while I was applying the fake blood to my costume. It was in a parking garage and it's one of my greatest con stories.

I'm saving up to start going to more conventions so maybe we will run into each other!
