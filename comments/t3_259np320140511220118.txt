I sort of see what you are saying about survivor letting it define you but I like the word survivor because it implies that you are stronger than the situation. 

Yes, I am trying to grow from this experience but because I didn't think too much about this situation, I actually ended up dating somebody after him who also treated me badly. He was less sexually abusive, although still sexually forceful but he often tried to make me feel bad about how I look, and made excuses that he was just trying to help me look the best that I can. 

Thanks for the inspiration. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books, actually.
