I don't want to blame him if it's my hair not holding the dye. But it's a problem too that when I talk to him about it, he's rather offhand and doesn't seem all that concerned about it. He did offer once for me to come back later in the week if I didn't like how it turned out, but I'm worried about overdoing the chemicals on my hair. And I don't have six hours in one week to be at the salon! I'm going to discuss these issues more firmly next time I see him, and if nothing changes, I'm going to at least try someone new.
