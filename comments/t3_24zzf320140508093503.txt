You're confidence does not improve by your clothing or a haircut. It all depends upon your attitude while addressing people, but that does not mean you be over powering. You need to firstly believe in yourself, whether addressing young people or those older than you. If you believe in yourself, then people around you will also. 

You will always be confident when you know for a fact that you are right. But that will not always be the case. There will be times when you are wrong and then you should be ready to accept your mistakes. Listen to other people's advices patiently, whether in the end you take their advice or not. Being a good listener will make a good impression about you in other peoples mind and that will help you a lot. What I'm trying to say is that if you approach people with a very positive attitude thinking that you are right (but you can always be wrong) and ready to listen to their suggestions and advices, you will automatically feel confident. 

When you are right, speak like there's no one around you and when you're wrong, be patient enough to listen to others and accept the fact that you are wrong. And yes, when speaking to a person or to a crowd, look into the eyes and then speak.

Just be yourself and that will be enough for you to be confident! :)
