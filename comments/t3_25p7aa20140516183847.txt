That's great, not everyone lives in an area close to Planned Parenthood or they aren't near one with a sliding scale. This is seriously a thing and became a pain in my ass when I tried to find a Planned Parenthood clinic when I was in college. 

I'm pretty confident in emergency settings, so if it requires immediate attention I'd maybe be able to know it needs it. Then again I've been in EMS so I kinda know a thing or two. Just a few things. 

I mean I wouldn't trust anyone here either, but I understand the want to come here to see what other people say if you have no one else in your life to talk to.
