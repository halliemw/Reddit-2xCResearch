But she may look amazing today, but obviously she didn't the entire rest of her life leading up to this point. Just because you are working on your body and improving your health does not mean that one day you wake up going FUCK IM HOTTTTTT just because you've reached a weight goal or your jeans fit better. It is a process, a very long one and anyone that has been overweight their entire life battles body dysmorphia at some level for a very long time after they are seen as "fit" by the rest of society. Comments like the one I replied to just seem to remind women that we aren't allowed to be proud of ourselves for fear of seeming vain and boastful. Fuck that noise.
