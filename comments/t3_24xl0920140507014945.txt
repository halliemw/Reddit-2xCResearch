I agree in that he is showing abusive behavior. I am not going to stay to see if he continues or not. 

He is not the father of my two children, their father passed away. It's a good thing I've not introduced my children to him, stuff like this is why I am hesitant to. My children don't need this in their lives. 

If I am not able to get the plan b, I am already looking into abortion options.
