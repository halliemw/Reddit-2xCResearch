I agree that there are probably a lot more women than we think there are. That being said, the front page can be an appalling place with misogynistic talk and r/gone wild running amuck. If I didn't have awesome guy friends to show me the awesome subreddits I probably would have never stayed on reddit. Its not a female friendly place generally. 

I was so excited when I found 2X. I was so excited when I found out that 2X would be a default. To me it means not only showing women and gents what an awesome place reddit can be, but also evening the playing field. Women are half the population, we shouldn't have to shut our opinions into a subreddit for the pleasure of the select few redpillers and their like. 

Eventually, this down voting will even out. In order for us to move forward and inclusive in our community were going to have to jump some hurdles. Really, that's what were best at, being supportive and surpassing derision. I think this is what mods intended. 2X can be that for the whole of reddit if only given the chance.
