Umm, I'm honestly still trying to figure that out. About a week before I got the cervixitis, I took several bad falls off a horse and bruised my hip/pelvic region, so my doctor says the fall could have jarred the iud and caused my uterus and cervix to get agitated and inflamed. We honestly don't know why it happened, so I think we decided to just make that the basic explaination
