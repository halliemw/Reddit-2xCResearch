That's so weird then but I guess it makes sense. I was told every 3 years when I got mine, but last year was told I was due for one at the same office. So one doctor said 3, then the doctor last year at the same place was probably going by the every 2 years...I ended up getting really busy and a new job and just never got around to going in for one (I know...) but then with my doctor last week saying every 3 years or every 5 if it's normal...ugh. I really wish there was a more clear "regulation" on the time frame since I always seem to get different answers.
