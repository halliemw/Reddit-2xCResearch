I was at a frat party in college and a guy grabbed my ass. It startled me so much that I actually shrieked, and then a bunch of other guys asked what happened. They actually threw that one guy out of the party for his behavior (I apparently wasn't the first girl he'd groped).
And sexism...every fucking day. I went for a walk last weekend and was cat-called by three different groups of men. I was wearing a baggy t-shirt and jeans. 
I'm starting to realize that I like being a woman, but if hate being a woman in this world.
