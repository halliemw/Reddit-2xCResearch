Hi, 
Is there a wedding planner you can call? What about the brides mom or something. 
I'm an ex-wedding planner and I have run in to this a few times. Sometimes the invite does get lost or forgotten. Sometimes people are a.....in it to win it. People really rake in at these events. 

I will never plan another wedding again in my life. 

good luck
