I strongly suggest you call your doctors' office as soon and it's open and push for an emergency visit.  If you have an ob/gyn they'd be your best choice.

I've been to the ER for the problems you have (minus the birth control).  I had a few invasive tests, was catheterized for a clean urine sample, and after several hours was given a narcotic injection and a suggestion to see my doctor. The few hours of pain relief following the injection was a relief but it wasn't worth the ordeal.
