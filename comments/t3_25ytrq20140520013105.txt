I'm not talking about medical school.  Medical students choose to put themselves in a situation where they will have to confront and purposefully override their reaction to grotesque situations.  In other parts of the medical field though, many professionals have not made that choice (like OP has not), and it is *always* courteous to warn them and *never* considered unprofessional or socially unacceptable if they decide to put their head down or turn away during potentially disturbing images.

Plus, you need a citation for: "likely to result in an intensely bad experiences in her future".  There's pretty strong evidence that confronting people with an averse stimuli before they are ready can make aversive reactions stronger, not weaker.
