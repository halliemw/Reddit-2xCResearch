I have endometriosis and I just got a new prescription to help with my heavy flow and it has worked WONDERS! It's cut my period time in half and doesn't seem to have any major side effects.

Crap, I don't know the name of it because it's at home, but I'll look it up tonight and send it to you. Chances are if you ask your gyno she'll know what it is.
