I did this privately, via email. 
M told me that he does find D's work offensive, but that he doesn't want to dictate what can and cannot be shown during meetings; he doesn't want to censor anyone. I'm against censorship, but I think that, in this case, it needs to be applied to anything hateful - this includes (but is not limited to) art that is racist, homophobic, misogynistic, misandristic, anti-Semitic, etc. I don't want our group to be associated with hate.
