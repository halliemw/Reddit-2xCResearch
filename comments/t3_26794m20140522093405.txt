You are not wrong to be pissed that people are browsing and shopping while you work. Your boss either knows and doesn't care, or knows and is the sort of person to let that shit build up for way too long. 

You may do better in a different sort of office or other work environment.

I spent ten years in a small business- a sales office with no more than 8 employees including the boss. This office had an open floor plan- no walls, no cubicles- just an open albeit L-shaped room. This meant there was no privacy at all, and when someone did need that five or ten minute mental break, others could see them and see if they were internet surfing or texting or doing anything besides working. It also meant we heard each other on the phone with clients and vendors. It was a highly critical atmosphere. It brought out the worst in everyone- including me. I found myself spending too much time thinking about the people at work. There were some really extreme extremes that occurred in this office. The kinds of things that happened there don't happen many places one might work. I am referring to physical violence, verbal abuse, public humiliation, and more. Without getting specific about those instances (I have in plenty of other posts, and there's just too many crazy things to list) I mention them only to say that this office I worked in was on the extreme spectrum of what sorts of shit lies beneath the banal surface of the small time sales office. This environment was toxic beyond your wildest imaginings of an office. It was terrible for my health in several ways. If I were you, I would look elsewhere.

A boss that knows something is wrong and does nothing at all about it is going to be frustrating - even if they have a legal reason for it, like waiting for a bad employee to no longer be pregnant, or in my case- I got to endure a painful 6 months wherein we all knew the young employee in the office was screwing the old man at the biggest client's office. My boss waited a miserable 6 months because it was enough time for the old man to get tired of the girl and not take his business elsewhere when she was fired. During that 6 months, I got to endure whispering in the break room, collusion between her and the other younger ladies in the office- as if we had no clue they all partied with Mr. Moneybags and that tons of whispering in a supposedly professional office is normal... sexy Halloween costumes specifically engineered for taking cell phone pics and sending them to the old man (she was a sexy football player- of his favorite NFL team), her coming to work with hickies from an old man on her neck- and her fights with her young husband bleeding into the office. 

Anyway - like I said, ten years of this...at the end of ten years I was an overweight smoker with no energy. Now I'm a much healthier weight, no longer smoke, and work in a job that requires both physical and mental agility and work. I am a lot happier.
