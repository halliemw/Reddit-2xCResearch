I know :( I'm really tempted too but I'm mostly worried about embarrassing myself, and people thinking it's not really a real emergency? I have insurance thankfully, and just finished paying off my last bit of debt to the hospital. 

A few months ago I was in so much pain on my lower right side I thought something was wrong with my appendix. Nope! Went in, got scanned, they told me I probably had mittelshmerz and that I had fluid around my ovary and it looked like an ovarian cyst had burst. Then they sent me home. Gahhh :S
