Freya! The goddess of love and Fridays. :D. I too was not originally a cat person. I like dogs, but was very lonely for a pet and am away from home for long stretches. I ended up getting a cat who needed a good home. She is wonderful. Cats can have awful awful personalities, but they can also be wonderful. I am glad you got a winner.
