Jesus that was infuriating to read. So Emma decided that for her own good she wanted no contact and this is absolutely tantamount to emotional battery. He pestered her with emails until she asked him repeatedly to cut contact. He somehow **by chance** took a date to where she was working as a waitress and noticing her distress he stayed for the date. Then she threatened legal action with one last email. 

He thinks the only reason someone should initiate no contact is for abuse. In his own words, it's not like I boiled your rabbit so why aren't you talking to me. **because she doesn't want to**

God. The entitlement. It's the size of his ex Microsoft millionaire much older gentleman's salary.
