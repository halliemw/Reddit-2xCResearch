Wait...are you serious right now? 

To bring any marginalized group "up" to the staus quo does not mean that you have to bring the status quo "down" in any way whatsoever. 

In the end it would enhance the quality of everyone's lives. I have never met a feminist who wanted to "bring men down", nor would I ever care to. Why would someone who works against marginalization think its ok to start marginalizing anyone?
