I can't be too much help since I'm just in college, but when I was younger my parents took in two of my cousins when they were in middle school. They were in foster care and we couldn't let that happen. It was good for them to live with my parents who are stable for a few years. They eventually went back with their dad, and he was still a drug user. They spent a lot of high school bouncing between friends houses, but the time they spent in a stable environment during their young teen years helped them see what life should be like for them. Taking in your sister while your dad gets back on his feet could be a tremendous help.
