Anne Gus is a pen name for a guy who goes by AryanofValhalla on thoughtcatalogue. He writes a lot of this stuff because apparently it's suuuuuper funny. You can be SO grateful though at least that she isn't actually real. 

Gawker covered him a while ago, read about it [here](http://gawker.com/gym-bro-successfully-gets-fake-feminist-thought-catalog-1545530204).
