meetup.com has plenty of other meetup groups you can try. I'm sure there are even ones specifically for new people to your city, and ones for women in your city.

Personally I would tell other people about what happened, so that they can decide whether they want to continue hanging out with this person. If not publicly, you can send a message to the mods. Even if that guy is a mod he won't be able to delete it.
