Had mine pierced twice. At 10 and 11. Both times ended with them getting ripped out by a soccer net. Wasn't terribly painful but I just let them close up.

Ten years later I still think they'd just be an annoyance for me.

My great grandmother never had her ears pierced. She died when I was six and left a whole collection of clip on earrings to us in hopes that my mom wouldn't "deface our bodies" or something like that.
