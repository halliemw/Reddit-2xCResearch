I have the Mirena IUD, and I love it. I'm one of the lucky women whose periods stopped entirely (and considering they were a source of unhappiness and occasional dysphoria every month, I'm really happy about it). Apart from some cramping fire the first couple of weeks after I got it inserted, I haven't had any side effects. I haven't had kids, some doctors will refuse to do the insertion if you're nulliparous, but if you try a few doctors you'll find one that will. The reasons given to me that some doctors refuse is that the insertion can be more difficult (ask for painkillers and/or a numbing/dilating shot, they don't always offer these and it's truly painful without them) and that there's a very small chance it can perforate the uterine wall and leave you unable to have children. However, there's a small chance of fatal blood clots while on the pill (nothing is perfectly safe), and I figured it was worth the risk. My partner says he felt the strings at the beginning, but over the course of a couple of months (I've had it over a year now) they became softer and don't poke at all now. There's lots of horror stories about IUDs out there, so I wanted to share my success story. All methods of birth control have horror stories, you just have to find the one that works for you.
