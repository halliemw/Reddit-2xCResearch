> because it was the right choice for me

That's all that matters. Pro-choice doesn't mean one can't feel conflicted about abortion. It's a complicated and for many a loaded issue and there often is no easy answer. But the decision is yours and whatever decision you make, there is no shame in it!

What's a shame is that your bf reacted so poorly and now still doesn't support you. I think it was okay to tell your mother what you were comfortable with, maybe one day you will tell her, maybe not. I don't think you "have to" do one thing or the other, but since you hope you can tell her one day, I hope so too! 

It's a clich√©, but time does heal some wounds. Give yourself the time to heal, it seems you already made some big steps, there's no need to push yourself further than you feel comfortable with. I wish you all the best!
