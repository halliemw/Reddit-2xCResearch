I'm thinking the same thing about not being able to prevent her from having sex. I think her parents feel it's inevitable too. They are aware that she's considering it.

She is in counseling but I don't know if this issue comes up. There are other things having a greater emotional impact right now, but it's possible sex is related to those. I can suggest that her or her mom give the counselor a head's up.
