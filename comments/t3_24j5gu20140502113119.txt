I never really comment but I wanted to tell you that going off the pill was the best decision I ever made. I was on it for two years and your paragraph about not knowing which emotions are real is so spot on to how I felt. I was down randomly throughout the day, I was depressed and disappointed with life, but everything about my life is amazing, so it seemed extra sad to me. I would cry at will, for no reason. 

I went off it in February, and I'm so grateful every single day that I did. I got a copper IUD which is so much better and more reliable for me, I hated taking a pill every day. I tried switching pills after a year to a lower dose hormone, which helped for a while but then got worse. 

I worry I'm not explaining myself well enough, or that anyone else's experience with birth control isn't going to mimic my experience. But going off made such a monumental change in my daily well-being that if anybody ever asks me if they should go off the pill, I sing the praises of being on hormone-free birth control and take them by the shoulders and look them in the eye and say, "Going off the pill is the best thing that ever happened to me" while birds flutter around me with confetti.
