well, you aren't actively dealing with the effects of cleaning under your foreskin at work.

Most period conversations I've had with women we're just complaints about cramps/needing a tampon. Or embarrassing stories dealing with them. If you have your period a week out of every month for years...that's a good portion of your life dealing with blood, diarrhea, etc. Men who expect to have relationships with women cannot be so sensitive.
