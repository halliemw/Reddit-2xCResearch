You say it is a great job but seem to really not want anyone to dare think that is what you do.
If you think it is lower than you just be honest (to us not them -lol!)

Otherwise if you really see no problem with it, then what does it matter if you go to the lunch and people mistake you, if someone asks what you do be honest. If they ask why you are there say you got invited to a professional lunch and weren't sure of the details then you all laugh about it.

Even if you hold nothing against that position bringing it up will always make it seem that way. 'Its not that I don't respect admin people, but you know I'm not one of them, right? right?' No matter how it is phrased will always sound like 'you know my job is different therefore more important than yours right? right?'
