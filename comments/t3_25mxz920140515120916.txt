OMG, are you ever good.  You should definitely go.  

You're going through a typical artist's dilemma.  Even Leonardo second-guessed his choices, at the end of his life.  

The workshop may not do *everything* you want it to do for you, but it represents a major step in acknowledging yourself as an artist.  You'll be networking internationally.  You need to shut down this little nay-saying voice and throw yourself into all the fun of planning for inter-cultural communication (lots of different languages at that workshop, I'm sure - it's so fun to go to such events and figure out how to make friends/contacts across the globe).

So bottom line is my advice is you get that little voice to STFU by hardcore planning (worrying if you must) about how to use the workshop to your best advantage.  

(If you can do that work in your spare time, you can become a full time illustrator...)
