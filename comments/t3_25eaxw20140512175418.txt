I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. 

I'm young so I can't really leave any advice or anything like that. I can say that I felt deeply saddened upon reading. 

While its awful, at least you came to an agreement with your SO. Why don't you communicate with him that you feel this way, even though it was the right decision (your words indicate so, not my own)

I know for sure that if i became pregnant, my SO would press for an abortion immediately. He's a lovely man but we're (19 and 22) are not ready for it. At all. I'd still feel awful if I had to terminate a child of his.

I have been told time heals all wounds, and this wound isn't an exemption to that.  Treat yourself when you can. Stay safe.
