So just to clarify -- you've experienced that white students in inner city schools aren't racist, and from that, you're extrapolating (a) that white students generally aren't racist, because (b) other white students don't tolerate racism?  Even granting the premise, those are some pretty big logical chasms you're leaping.

And if we don't need logic, and personal experience is sufficient here, I can say that white kids in majority white suburban schools definitely tolerate racism in other white kids.
