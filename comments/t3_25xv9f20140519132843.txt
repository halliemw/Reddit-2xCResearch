Interesting. I'm a moderator in other subs and I can remove things but not actually delete them. The comment was not horribly rude but absolutely setting up to be confrontational. Based on the other comments of the user, I think they knew that very well.  There are lots of ways to have discussions that do not start out in confrontational ways. The users other comments did not demonstrate that they were capable of that. Again, the 'dumb slut' remark to someone who was sorting out a sexual assault incident is obviously a sign of someones inability to argue in a productive manner.
