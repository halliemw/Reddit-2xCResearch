He has the equal right to be kicked to the kerb as a friend.   What kind of friend would do that to you?   

I agree with alot of the other posters who say that if people are gay they sometimes get a "pass" on behaviour like this;I think it's just people are so afraid to be critical of their actions for fear of being labelled homophobic that they just say nothing so often that people like your friend just feel they can get away with anything.
