He definitely did not say "defer to your husband"; at one point he flat out stated that I'm the stronger of the two of us :) He has two kids of his own, so knowing both of us, he pointed out some personality quirks that are contributing to the problem. He said there's no easy answers (a with most things in life), but gave me some suggestions of how to speed things along to get my husband in the right frame of mind (i.e. don't a grumpy pants, enjoy your kids, pick up some slack, etc.).

I can't deny that this phase of relationship has left some lasting marks, though, and that makes me sad, because I have to let go of the image I had of him (and myself frankly) before.

TL;DR It's hard to give the whole story on the internet, and growing up is tough :(

EDIT: Sorry, I didn't mean to dismiss your point. You are correct, religious counsel can be risky, and occasionally some of what my priest says is a bit sexist, which I'm not crazy about (he's from Eastern Europe so different culture too =O ). I try to filter, for everyone's benefit ;)
