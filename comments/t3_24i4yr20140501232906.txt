Well, I move in on Sat and so I'm going to the new place tomorrow at ten AM to meet the Comcast tech dude so he can set up my service. Why this is necessary seeing as I know the previous tenant had Comcast also...anyway, I'm bringing my own router from my old apartment for them to set up so I won't have internet here tomorrow for my last night,  even though service doesn't shut off until Monday.
