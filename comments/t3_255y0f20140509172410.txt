I tied to make these: https://slm-assets1.secondlife.com/assets/5617591/view_large/Harem%20Pants.jpg?1337735120

but it was not to be.  My co-worker paid me a dollar to wear them to work after I texted her a picture.  Turns out they were so baggy I really didn't need a shirt at all.

Moral of the story: You can't eyeball everything.  Some clothes need a pattern, some just need a match and a lot of kerosene.

Edit:  Whoa, thanks for the gold!  That cost more than the price I paid for the fabric.  : )
