There's definitely a culture of self-diagnosis and romanticizing. Absolutely. 

There are books and movies like Girl Interrupted, where you see these pretty young things living these dramatic life styles and girls somehow manage to relate every moment of angst in their lives to these characters... Then, they take to tumblr or what have you, and the next girl relates to them and the cycle continues. 

I have bipolar disorder. It's scary. Sometimes it's debilitating. I wish I didn't have it and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. It makes me sick and sad to see the the way that some people view mental illness as something special. 

Of course I'm an adult now, in the corporate world. The folks that I see romanticizing mental illness are mostly online (although someone did recently tell me that having bipolar disorder was "cool.") My day-to-day struggle is with the stigma that mentally ill people are all crazy, unstable and dangerous.
