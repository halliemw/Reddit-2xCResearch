I don't know the extent of these "crumbling" episodes, but your boyfriend sounds more or less a lot like me when I was in my 20's. I eventually grew out of it. I'm still a fairly harsh judge of myself, but I take it all in stride now. My wife finds my negative comments about myself a bit annoying, but she knows that I'm a happy, confident person nowadays, despite my occasional harsh judging of myself.
