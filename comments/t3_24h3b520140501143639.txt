I am so sorry for your loss. I won't say I know how you feel but since my dad was an alcoholic (and more or less a drug user) and he died almost half a year ago very suddenly I suppose there is some common ground here. 

He did some horrible things and at the age of 14 I actually started wishing he would die. Well, he finally did, about 15 years later. I was somewhat surprised about how I felt. For one, I actually cried a little, which I didn't see coming and second, I started feeling sorry for him. 

I don't know your dad, but knowing alcoholics I would strongly suggest that you forgive your self. He may have had good intentions on contributing to an upcoming wedding and your future but then again alcoholics make a lot of empty promises and attempts to be kind and generous that in the end run out in the sand. That's the sad truth. It is not the person, its the addiction and/or mental disorders often associated with it. Once it is the drink or someone elses well-being, it will be the drink that wins. Had he not died, the chances are great that you would have ended up disappointed and hurt. I am really sorry to say these harsh words, but I am fairly certain that's the case.

Never the less, he was still your father and feeling guilt, sorrow, anxiety etc is normal. 

The following poem was helpful for me, I hope it can be helpful to you. I think it really fits well with the death of someone one had a complicated relationship to.

"When I am dead
Cry for me a little
Think of me sometimes
But not too much.
Think of me now and again
As I was in life
At some moments it's pleasant to recall
But not for long.
Leave me in peace
And I shall leave you in peace
And while you live
Let your thoughts be with the living"
