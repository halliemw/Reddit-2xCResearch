I believe you are defining prejudice, not racism. *Why* are black people the demographic most affected by poverty? Racism.


Dr. Beverly Tatum defines racism as oneâ€™s benefiting from **a system of privileges based on race** that are subtly ingrained in the surrounding culture, making it difficult to detect. In this sense, **all white people are racist;** we benefit from this system of privileges. I am a racist. It is possible for people of color to be prejudiced on the basis of race, but the social system is never in their favor. This is racism.
