Try using at least two methods, so if one fails, you're still covered.
pill + condom (when he finishes, but go without beforehand); pill + family planning (only works if you have a really regular cycle, but have him not finish without a condom when you are ovulating); pill + pulling out, etc.

There are also many BC options that do not stop your period (copper IUD, NuvaRing, many pills), so you can opt for one of those.
