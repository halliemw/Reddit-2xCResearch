Yeah sometimes this doesn't work. Or else people just like to tighten the lug nuts on my tires down obnoxiously tight. 

I have: Stood on the 4 way. When that didn't work... I bounced/jumped on it. Still no go. I'm not a lightweight. 

About all I did was manage to lift the car a little off the ground. I had a friend come to the rescue, and even he had a hard time getting them to break loose, and he did oil and tire changes for a living.
