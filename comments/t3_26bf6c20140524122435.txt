There's a great documentary (I think it's streaming on Netflix) called "This Film Has Not Yet Been rated." It talks a lot about what's wrong with the Hollywood rating system, but it does delve into sexism on screen, and it's better at it and more articulate than I am. 
(Unrelated, but the documentary about killer whales at SeaWorld - "Blackfish" - is also awesome.)
