Oh my god!! I thought I was the only one.. where do you get your designs?? I've been running out of new options. [This](http://www.crossstitchworld.com/cross-stitch-detail.php?RecordID=35153) is my pride and joy- not only is it a wonderful image but it has wonderful detailing with back stitching, couching, french knots.. I was so sad to finish it, working on it was so much fun. Are there any stores that carry a variety of designs? Or do you make your own?

Sorry for the excitement, I get a bit carried away on occasion. :)
