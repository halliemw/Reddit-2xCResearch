I read novels and comics, occasionally I paint, lately I've been watching Netflix and folding 1000 paper cranes for my brother's wedding. When I get home from work/school I take my roommate's dog on a 4mi run every other day. When I get really bored I'll cook something amazing or do a lot of yoga. I just recently got into a new relationship (he's amazing), but he's an undergrad in engineering (I'm a grad student in the same dept, but I'm less busy, haha), so he's working on hw and labs constantly. As an engineer I also pick up on electronics tinkering. I need a function generator for my masters project, but I know my adviser is going to take a month to get me one, so I've started putting one together with an Arduino.  Hobbies can translate into incredibly useful skills. My best friend writes a blog on book reviews and another blog on political commentary. She's got a masters in polisci, so the writing stuff keeps her skills up. Maybe find something enjoyable that translates into a skill that'll help in a career as well as be pleasurable?
