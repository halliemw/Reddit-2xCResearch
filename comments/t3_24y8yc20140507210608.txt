I admit it's partly psychological, but partly that the fabric in bathing suits is supposed to not absorb liquid, and the fabric in a lot of underwear is really absorbent. It's like five-second-rule-ing on a hard wood floor or on the carpet. It probably doesn't *really* make a difference, but it feels different.
