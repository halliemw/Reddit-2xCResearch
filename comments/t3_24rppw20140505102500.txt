I really dislike the purity ball movement, but do these photos strike anyone else as a little biased and forced? I recently saw a picture of a little girl who was going to church run ball with her stepdad and they both happy, very organic expressions of the promise of a nice father-daughter bonding experience (no idea if it was a purity ball, so that might be the explanation of why there is a difference, but I doubt these girls are old enough or are just barely old enough to understand the implications of what these photos stand for.)
