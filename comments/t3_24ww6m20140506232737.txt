At night in a car I don't think he could have told if it was a man or woman.

But overall I disagree, I don't see how approaching the car is worse than approaching on the street.  I don't see how a car ADDS a personal boundary, though that's not what were really arguing (and evidence by the comments it's really a matter of personal taste). Even if it does I don't think it gives cause to act rude, he wasn't actually violating her in any way.
