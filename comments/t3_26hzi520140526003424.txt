Yes concealed carry would be a gun. They aren't for everyone.

The main difference between a taser and a stun gun is the taser shoots two prongs at your target, which send electrical shock through your target and rendering his muscles useless. Thus, dropping the person to the ground. A stun gun on the other hand has to make contact with the target and does not shoot anything. It shocks the target much like a taser, but since there is only one point of contact, it does not render anything useless. It is basically the pain of a taser without the demobilizing functionality.
