And this right here is so much of the issue - the rapes that aren't "violent", per se.  It wasn't a dark alley, it wasn't a stranger, there wasn't a knife or a gun - it was simply without consent.  

I am sure your ex didn't beat you, he just decided that he was having sex with you when you stated that you didn't want to.  And he has no idea that that was rape.  The problem is, most men don't know that that is rape, and well, most women don't, either.  The difference is, the women who are raped in this situation come away feeling something - whether its dirty, betrayed, exposed, vulnerable, that's up to the individual - but the men just had sex with their loving significant other and have no idea what just happened. 

You're right - this does need to be talked about, because right now, we are only talking about the dark alleyways.
