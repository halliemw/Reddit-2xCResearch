>If she didn't like the rules provided she is more than welcome to create her own prom to attend.  

The thing is, she didn't break any rules. She followed the "fingertip" rule, as evidenced by the picture in the article. The fathers decided (based on their personal opinions) that her dress was "provocative" and causing them and the young men to think "impure" thoughts. If she was following the rules of the organization, why should she be reasonable for the dads and young men who were thinking about her in a sexual way? 

Also, considering she can legally get married, I wouldn't call her "just a child". She is a young woman who is about to go to college and be a full legal adult.
