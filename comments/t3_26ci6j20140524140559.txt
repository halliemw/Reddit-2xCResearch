Ahhh I know your right. I do my negative/positive pressure checks every day and I know that my seal isn't 100% because of my head band.... but my hair hated being exposed to concrete dust and the tyvek hood doesn't cover my head well enough. :(

If I wasn't working outside or was being exposed to more harmful chemicals (all I'm using the APR for is for the concrete dust we're producing) I would FOR SURE not be wearing the headband.... Regardless, this is duly noted and I will be reconsidering wearing it on Monday. :)
