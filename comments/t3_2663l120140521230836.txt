Is this among the group or in private? I'm curious because it affects any advice I could offer. I completely understand how you must feel though. Remember, you said yourself you aren't alone in your feelings. Encourage them to speak up and if you are comfortable make a point to reach out to anyone who seemed uncomfortable or scared away from the group.  Be frank and make it clear that there is more to your club than some jerk who likes to make rape comics. Ask M directly exactly his opinion. Don't allow him to give a politicians answer. I'd suggest THAT conversation in private though as I personally feel it's important to give him a chance as a friend, and not feel like he needs to give a leader's response.

I don't think you should have to leave a club you are obviously invested in. But, if you still can't reach a solution don't feel bad if you do leave because it's no longer enjoyable for you down the road. Also, I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. I hope it works out.
