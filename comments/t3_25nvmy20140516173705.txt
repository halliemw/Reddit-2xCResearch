I see what you're saying, but my original comment has 69 downvotes. If these people going to get butthurt just because I said anything other than "that cop should lose his job, what an evil piece of shit," then I don't want their respect. Also, anyone decently intelligent should be able to recognize that calling him/her an idiot in that situation was appropriate, because what he/she said was clearly idiotic.
