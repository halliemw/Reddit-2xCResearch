I have/had trigeminal neuralgia and was pretty sure I knew what it was before I got to the ER, not that I was discussing anything with anyone - I was in that much pain.  Partner had to articulate circumstances.  They sent me home with tylenol/codeine (which I'd already been taking, I never use a full prescription).  I knew I needed a different kind of drug, but I was at the point of kicking walls and talking through gritted teeth (incoherently, had already taken too much codeine).  

So, I ended up taking all of the pills in about 4 hours and called the ER to tell them that.  They said I could come in the next day for more!  I pointed out that I was just notifying them that they were aiding in my suicide due to PAIN.  Shocked silence, told to see a private doctor.

Fortunately, I was able to get into a private doctor's office early the next morning and he knew right away to give me a different sort of medicine.  Nerve pain doesn't respond to codeine.

They should have known that in the ER.  The other medicine alleviates the pain in tiny increments (which is all a person wants in that situation) and is very hard to OD on.  But no.  They gave an opiate instead.

I guess they liked me, because many people who actually want/need codeine can't pry it out of their hands.  The fact that I was banging my head and feet against the wall, blood pressure was sky high, pulse was up - all convinced them to "reward me" with an opiate.

/very high pain thresholds, migraines are terrible, but TN is way worse, in case you're wondering about my head banging - first and only time for that.
