Look I agree with you that some people shouldn't drink, but on the other hand I used to drink a lot more than I do now, and I have blacked out a bunch of times. The worst I did was eat too many hot dogs or something, I never became angry or violent at all.  Not all blackouts are "very scary". I also disagree that him stopping drinking might solve this problem, in my eyes this guy is just bad news.
