This might have been treatable with therapy. Professionals do in fact help people with destructive thought patterns. Psychopathy may be incurable, but this type of thought pattern can be broken if you just talk to the right people about it and they help you deconstruct it.

I'm not saying he's not responsible for his actions. I'm just marvelling at his lack of self-awareness. I have fairly common violent fantasies (like picturing myself stabbing someone who's texting in the movie theater), but I am fully aware that they are exaggerations of how I'm feeling and I keep them in check. I just don't see how you can sit down and *write out* a plan like this and not have a single moment of "Gosh, this seems extreme even to me!"
