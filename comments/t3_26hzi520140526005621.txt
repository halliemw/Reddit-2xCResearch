When in a high crime area be aware of your surroundings. Don't create a pattern, taking the same way home everyday, that makes you predictable and easy to target. If someone looks like trouble do not, let me repeat, do not make eye contact and remain aware. If a taser or pepper spray make u feel better than do it but being aware of what and who is around you will help a lot. Best of luck to you.
