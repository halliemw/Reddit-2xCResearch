You're welcome to PM me anytime. :)  It doesn't have to be now though that's fine too, it definitely doesn't have to be consistent, but if you're ever lonely, or just have something on your mind, or want to share something really great or very sad or rage inducing that happened, my inbox is always open.  I usually respond within a day or two.  

It generally starts out with frequent PMs, usually getting to know each other kind of stuff.  Most of them die off fairly quickly just like you've said.  Sometimes there's just not enough compatibility or there's real life stuff going on and that has a higher priority.  But sometimes you just find someone who's great to talk to and has a similar threshold for non-communication, will be there when you really need to talk, and doesn't take a long absence personally.
