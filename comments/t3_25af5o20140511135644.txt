You post just made me tear up. I too lost my mother when I was 8 and my little sister was 2. She was just 39. I love going through her things, through my old baby photos, notes she wrote for my dad, seeing reminders of her in things I do and things I see. I don't think she ever really thought of her own mortality, but I know she made the most of photos and diaries, as if she made them for the benefit of others, for us, later on. After she died, my dad felt the need to pick up where she left off; he started writing letters, diaries, he bought cameras and encouraged us to remember. He died too 6 years later; officially it was cancer as well, but I'm certain it was a broken heart. He left us knowing that we knew our history, how to love, to appreciate and to look back, as well as forwards. They were always a team, right from when my mum was first born (childhood neighbours), so it was inevitable that wherever one went, the other would soon follow.

Your comment about your wedding day hit me hard; I cannot wait to be married someday but I also know it'll be one of the hardest days, to know that they can't be there to share it with you to start your new life and to be proud of what you've become. 

Much love to you and your wonderful mother on mothers day x
