thanks.  I realized that I don't really care about the appearance of the inside of my shoes - I was just concerned that others would judge me or something lol.  I do care if they  begin to smell though - so there are powders that  fix that?


I just smelled the inside of my fave ballet flats and they smell exactly like leather! haha (because that's what they are made of I guess)
