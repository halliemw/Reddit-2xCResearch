Hm, my pros and cons:

Pros:

Periods are predictable and pain is manageable, unlike before

Acne completely cleared up, it was a miracle

Don't have to worry about getting pregnant

Cons:

Have to remember to take a pill every day

I have to take it at night, before I go to bed. Taking it in the morning kinda messes me up all day (heartburn, dizziness)
