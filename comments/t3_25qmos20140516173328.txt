I've been on the pill for about 10 years too. My family doctor says she's not worried about it for me and we're just continuing to monitor. I'm a non-smoker, no family history of clots or other risk factors, and my body tolerates it well, so your mileage may vary. But just wanted to give an anecdotal perspective that I've discussed it with my family doctor for me personally, and she wasn't worried about any long-term risks associated with taking it for a long period.
