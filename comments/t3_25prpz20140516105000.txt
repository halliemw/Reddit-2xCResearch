Nice! How's the kickback on that thing? My SO is teaching me how to properly load, use, break-down, and clean all his guns, and it's a ton of fun (surprising thing for a girl from CT to say).   
My only complaints come when I'm shooting the BIG rifles/shotguns, bc my right should is effed up from a previous injury and some of them leave me sore for days. I'm a huge fan of the handguns tho :)
