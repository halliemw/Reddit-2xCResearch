It's not coincidence that the mid-century era, during which arose this idea that women shouldn't leave the home (which was previously reserved for the wealthy, and infiltrated the middle class in this time), coincided with the automation of a great deal of "women's work".  Not merely computational tasks.

This wasn't the only factor in play, but it's often overlooked.
