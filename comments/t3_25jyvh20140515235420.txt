Myself. It's a necessary balance, to detach myself partially from reality, lest I go insane. It's a harsh world we live in - for me, staying always completely connected means, without fail, always considered the poor, sick, defenseless and all other utterly miserable people I can't do anything for. It's exhausting. It doesn't help, either, that small "tragedies" have been hurled my way for the past 2-3 years. But sometimes I slide too far down that slope and need to get my bearings again - and this place helps amongst other things.
