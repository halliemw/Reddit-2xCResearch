I work retail and I've seen people do this to my sister when she is shopping with me, my dad or other males and I know how irritating it can be.  My sister was once shopping for a laptop with my dad and the salespeople pretty much ignored her while talking to my dad and assuming that he is the only one of the both of them who is tech-literate and has money to spend... WRONG, it's my sister who knows more than him and was shopping at the time.  She ended up walking out of the store.   I make it a point to NOT do this.  If people are shopping as a couple, I try to give each of them an equal ratio of eye contact, switching it back and forth every few seconds in the conversation to make sure they both feel included on whatever decision it is that they are making.  One mental trick I use and teach to employees who are being trained is to tell them to simply assume that couples are splitting the bill for *xyz* items 50/50 unless one willingly defers to the other.
