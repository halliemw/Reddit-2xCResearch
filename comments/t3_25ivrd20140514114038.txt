It used to be the case that breaking off contact was the default mode of breaking up.  Hardly anyone (back, say in the 70's and 80's) tried to remain friends.  Certainly in my parents' generation, break-ups usually meant polite avoidance (often forever, and my aunts were really good at that).  

I'm only partly joking when I say that television shows like *Friends* and later notions like "friendzoning" had a lot to do with constructing a reality in which both men and women can insist that it is healthier to remain in contact, even if one person has very good reasons for not wanting to remain in contact.  

It is of course great if people *can* remain friends, but it certainly is up to each individual to decide.  Friendships can't be unilateral.  I'm glad the guy in your story apologized, but people (if they are feeling emotional distant) are supposed to act emotionally distant if everyone is going to get along in the long run.
