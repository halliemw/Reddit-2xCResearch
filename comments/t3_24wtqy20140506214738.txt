[Here](http://www.hiddenhurt.co.uk/bible_verses.html) is a list of Bible verses condemning domestic violence and offering support to victims. At no point does the Bible say anyone deserves abuse, and at every chance, Jesus makes it clear that even the worst people are to be treated with love and not abuse. At the absolute worst, they should be shunned, and that's only if they're hurting other people consistently and deliberately. Whatever her husband may say, God doesn't think she deserves abuse.

[Here's](http://www.womenshelters.org/det/christian-service-ctr-of-st-louis) some information about what seems to be a Christian-based women's shelter. [This](http://www.newlifeevangelisticcenter.org/100-years-of-christian-service-in-st-louis/) is also a place that looks like they could give you some information if you hit a lot of dead ends. I tried to stick to some religiously based organizations, because I know that sometimes religion can be twisted to excuse awful things like abuse and she may benefit from someone who can help her see it as inexcusable within her faith and can maybe approach her value as a person from a religious angle.
