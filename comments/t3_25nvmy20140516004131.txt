Normally I would agree with you. However, this is one of those cases where minds won't be changed. I never expected to change his/ her mind. I know that person's thought process involves little logic and a lot of emotion. If you just think about what the person was saying, you can tell he/she is hopeless. Calling me hysteric and calling false rape accusations "incredibly rare."

I wasn't trying to change her mind. I was trying to point out to other people how wrong this woman is.

Also, the definition of lost is "be deprived of or cease to have or retain (something)." I haven't lost anything. I know I'm right. Not a single one of my points has been successfully countered. I know I can't change people's mind here. My original comment is now -26. Nobody is explaining why I'm wrong, nobody is logically countering my argument, they're just seeing something that goes against their (ridiculous) beliefs, and going "ahhhh, I don't like this!"

You seem intelligent and I see what you're saying, and that would be valid if my goal were to change that person's mind. But it's not.

Also the person I insulted wasn't the OP.
