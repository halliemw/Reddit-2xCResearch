I forced myself to use them due to what almost seems like it should be a scene in a preteen movie. I was scared of them, but I had been invited to the popular girls end of school year pool party. My boyfriend was going, I had the cutest new bikini, and I was actually being included for once! Then of course I just had to get my period that morning, oh and my new bikini happened to be mostly white. greaaaat.

So I locked myself in the bathroom with a tampon and the instructions from the box and read them over like 10 times. It kind of painful at first and I wasted one, but I eventually got it and was super proud of myself :)
I have to say though, that was not how I thought tampons worked before I read the instructions.
