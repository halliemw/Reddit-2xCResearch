I'm a hostess at a restaurant in New York. There are a few downsides to being a woman here, the main one is that we're required to wear high heels throughout our shift, which can be up to 10 hours without sitting down. Also the main part of our job is to walk up and down a flight of stairs (to seat guests), which I have fallen on twice (could have happened anyway but the heels dont help). When I asked what we would have to wear if we were guys, he said "nice dress shoes," and when I asked why we can't just wear nice dress shoes he didn't really have a response.

The other annoying thing is that we are required to dress like we're "on a date," a short black cocktail dress or blue jeans and a top. I understand that we should look well groomed but I feel like on a date you are trying to attract someone physically which shouldn't be part of my job. 
Also drunk guys often entrap me at the hostess stand and stare at my chest and I can't really tell them to fuck off because its my job to be super polite. I can't help but think my appearance (shoes/hair/clothing color) wouldn't be so highly emphasised/exploited if I were male.
