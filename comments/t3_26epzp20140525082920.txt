Very fair point about your self worth being tied to your looks... Though I still feel there is an enormous amount of pressure on men to be good looking as well (or have a successful career when older, I guess).



Look, all your points are fair but I just think you're shooting yourself in the foot by painting men as the bad guy. The way you phrased "the patriarchy backfiring against men" makes it sound like you think all men are in on some conspiracy to drown women's voices out. Unfortunately, some men and some women are guilty of this. The dividing line isn't between genders, and you're only frustrating yourself and hurting your movement's like ability by acting like it is. 



Lashing out at every man and saying that we couldn't possibly understand isn't too constructive either. Oh, and every time someone tries to go swimming (men's rights movement) they get laughed at. Damned if you do, damned if you don't?
