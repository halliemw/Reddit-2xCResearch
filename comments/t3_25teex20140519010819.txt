> I've tried softcups for menstrual periods, and if the ring is anything like those, I'm not sure if I will be comfortable with it.

Personally, I can't even feel the ring, but I can always feel even the smallest tampons, which is why I use pads for my periods. However, some people report some irritation when using it. Hard to say how it would work for you, but it might be worth a try if you exhaust the other options.

Your usual side effects with BC sound really harsh. :( That's like what I got when I tried the patch, but at least in my case it happened right away so I knew what was going on. The issue with the side effects worsening over time sounds very difficult to deal with.

I hope you can find something that works better for you.
