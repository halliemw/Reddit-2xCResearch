Only you can decide when and how you want to eat and move. But you should be honest, because that's the only way to really look at yourself and decide that you are or aren't happy with who you are.

But 5' 3" isn't overweight, it's ~~morbidly~~ obese. While you may be young and not seeing any physical effects, morbid obesity is a serious predictor of your future health. 

Anyway I've always heard that physical health is 75% eating and 25% activity. 

You should try and find a way of eating that you can live with and is sustainable but is good for you.

And try and find a way to move that you enjoy. If either are work it will never work. 

I run, but I have friend who would kill themselves rather than run. Some swim, some play intramural sports.

Good luck.
