>My suggestion for finding more sexual partners is to ask more people if they would like to be your sexual partner, which I believe I did mention. 

I mean, telling people to be active agents is definitely good advice, but you're really drastically simplifying the the other steps that need to be taking before you're in a position where you can safely ask that question and not come off like a creep. You need to get a decent Idea of whether or not a girl likes you before you ask a question like that. These guys don't even know how to get to the starting line and you're giving them advice for the last 30 meters of the race.
