Exactly this. There's nothing wrong with having a large or small body; it's your body and it's okay no matter the size or shape. There is something wrong with lying and manipulating. So as long as you are honest throughout your profile, you will *never* end up someone's horror story.

  It's hard finding romance when society has "othered" you the way that women of size are othered. But the fact is that your size will not matter to some people, and other people are actively attracted to you *because* of your size. Being lonely is hard whether you are conventionally attractive or not, but just remember that you are perfectly acceptable as a person and deserving of love and respect. Best of luck to you, OP!
