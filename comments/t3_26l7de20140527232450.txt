I've gone to Toni & Guy several times now, It is $15 at my location for a wash, cut, and style. It might take longer than a normal cut but I've always had a good experience. This past time I went in and went from having hair that was just below my shoulder blades to a chin length bob (which was 8" cut off) and I loved it. My stylist was really happy and asked if she could use my hair in her portfolio. 

The best part about an academy is if you're not happy the instructors can/will fix your hair before you leave. Basically if I can help someone learn, have a good experience, and pay $20 for a haircut with tip I'm happy.
