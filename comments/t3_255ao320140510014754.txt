Large-ish city in the American South. I get catcalled a LOT. What I'm wearing doesn't matter, though how muscular I am seems to. When I'm lifting and look like it, I get catcalled hardly ever. When I'm doing more cardio for a while, the catcalls are CONSTANT, like multiple times per day constant.

I do live in and walk around in my city's downtown, though.
