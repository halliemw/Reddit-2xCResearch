Thank you. Like I mentioned above, I don't think I'm the level of pretty that most of those guys would be willing to get in any sort of trouble over, and I feel like it wasn't really them trying to harass me as much as it was them making fun of me and their friend playing the "pig party" game where you hit on ugly girls. That seems ridiculous when I type it out, but that's how I felt afterwards debating telling my husband. I don't know.
