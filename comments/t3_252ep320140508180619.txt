I also hid it for a year. I was ten when I got it and I have an older sister who didn't have hers yet. I was caught when my parents found a pair of stained underwear I had hidden under my mattress. My mom is still upset that I didn't tell her (17 years later). And I still feel like I would have rather they not found out. :P
