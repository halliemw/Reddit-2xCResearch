Thanks for sharing. I'm working on that now, so I'm trying to find ways to help me not focus on the desire and wanting to be desired. I'm doing the same things you're doing but I'm not really dating. I'm trying to see if there's a happy place where I can be happy with myself without feeling like a loser.
