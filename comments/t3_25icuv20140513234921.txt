Personally, I would post anonymously in the subreddit that the meet up was based in that this happened. Don't say the guy's name, or call him out. Just relate anonymously what happened, and that you and your boyfriend are no longer comfortable attending meet ups there. 

If I was hosting an event somewhere, I would want to know something like this had happened so that I would know how to prevent it in the future. It may start a system discussion, but it's better to talk about stuff like this in the open. It may be that the guy meant nothing by it, it might be that he was a  jerk groping your ass. The only way that people are going to realize that certain behavior is wrong & inappropriate is if somebody says something about it. You could also try to talking to the guy directly & privately for an apology if you like. It's up to you, good luck
