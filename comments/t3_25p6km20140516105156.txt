I like it very much, but I think the point is that it shouldn't really matter. Her job is a comedian. Why should everyone be gossiping about her appearance? Would people be gossiping about what Louis CK wore to an award ceremony? Maybe if he showed up in boxers or something. I think women are judged too harshly by how they look instead of what they do.
