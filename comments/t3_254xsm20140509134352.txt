One of the best things about this sub are the posts women make when they allow themselves to be vulnerable. Since being defaulted, many posters (including myself) have not felt at all okay with opening up to the trolling and ridicule that would come from a personal post. So that genre of threads has been put on hold. The TMI posts are funny and allow for a different sort of vulnerability - biological rather than emotional - which is harder to attack or mock. 

I'm glad people are still posting personal stuff at all. So many of the new posts yesterday were from users clearly new to the sub linking to news articles on "woman" topics, which are fine, but not what this sub was ever really about.
