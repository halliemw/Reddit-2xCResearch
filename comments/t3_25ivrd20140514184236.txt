Only around 1 in 3 grow up to have problems with the judicial system as adults as abusers. Just over half will bump into the juvie system in some way but that's teenage acting out of their trauma. But as adult only around a third with have violent tendencies. Which means, as you said, most children who suffer abuse (sexual and other) don't grow up to become abusive.
