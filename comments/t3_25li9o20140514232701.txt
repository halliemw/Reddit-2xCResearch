Interesting! 

I donated some of my hair about two months ago, now. I went with Pantene Beautiful Lengths donation. 

My hair was to the small of my back, and we cut it to just about shoulder length, a bit longer, so I could still pull it back. Pantene requires eight inches for the hair, and I think mine was about ten or so. 

I cover my hair, and when it gets that long, I start to get annoyed at it, so I figured, send it to someone who would get more use out of it than I, and make someone else happy with it.

I intend to keep donating it whenever it gets long enough to do so.
