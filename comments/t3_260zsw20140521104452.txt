It probably really depends. My fiance's grandparents are in a unique situation when it comes to that. Her grandmother is very religious in a very conservative branch of the Church of Christ. And all their children and grandchildren (with the exception of my fiance and myself) are conservative Church of Christ. CofC believe only CofC are going to heaven essentially (and they don't play music in their church and don't have any kind of kitchens or anything like that.) But her grandfather is not religious. He goes to services most of the time with her grandmother, but he doesn't take communion and hasn't been baptized in the church. Which means he isn't a member of the church, and is essentially "lost." 

My fiance has asked her mother whether they think he'll go to hell and stuff, and her answer was kind of a shrug and a 'well no one really knows for sure.' Honestly, I think if pushed most of their family's answers would be along the lines of "yes, he's probably going to hell, but we try not to think or talk about it." Which is the same thing they would say about us. Which must be upsetting and why neither of us ever push the subject or really ever bring up religion.
