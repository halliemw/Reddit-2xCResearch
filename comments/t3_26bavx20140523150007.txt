I don't know. I don't believe this guy thinks he's 100% innocent - he gave that away when he pre-emptively lied about OP's consent to being fondled. But I do believe this guy thinks that that it's a minor bad thing that most guys do - a small oopsies, rather than the Big Fucking Deal that it is. I think that's why he reacted to strongly when OP said or implied that he's a rapist. He doesn't think of himself in those terms.
