The thing about abortion is that it IS another form of birth control. Saying that some abortions are more valid or reasonable than others is like saying that one person's reason for taking birth control is more valid than someone else's. I get the warm beautiful baby thing, I've been pregnant and have a wonderful daughter, but honestly I'm even more pro-choice having experienced pregnancy and motherhood. Being pregnant is hard, being a mother is even harder, "I just want an abortion" is the only reason anyone needs imho.

That said, I'm glad your so amped on pregnancy and motherhood! The whole weird journey is pretty cool, it's good to stay jazzed about it.
