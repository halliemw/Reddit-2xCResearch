I'm a very new Redditor, and honestly probably wouldn't have stuck around had it not been for this sub-Reddit and maybe a couple of others. I hope that when I've contributed (still dipping in my toes) it's been constructive and kind.

I can absolutely understand that for established members, it's frustrating to suddenly be bombarded with a load of hostile or disingenuous posts. But it's also heartening for those of us using the site for the first time to see a supportive space for women where nonsense is swiftly and decisively shut down.

So, swings and roundabouts, I guess. I've not got around to personalising my preferences yet, so I'm still clicking through to this comm. If it goes off the front page, eh, I'll search for it and sign up. But I suspect lots of other people won't get the chance to, because they simply won't know it's here - as you said, Reddit can come across as overwhelmingly a "boys club".
