Support you will get! I became a "domestic engineer" over ten years ago. My husband supported me before we were married and continues to do so. I'm depressed and have very low energy, so I do what I can for our household but it requires lots of breaks and napping. My family keeps asking me when I'll "start my career" and give me pitying looks when I tell them I'm actively working on becoming an author.

I feel bad about myself when my husband has to pick his clothes out of the laundry basket some mornings, but at least they're clean. I feel bad when we don't eat what I planned for dinner because I didn't make it, but we keep healthy options available rather than pizza or take-out.

It feels like I'm subsisting rather than living my life, and I have a good cry about once a month. But it is what it is and at least I can get out of bed in the morning and be grateful for my husband. I don't have any instructions for feeling successful, just support. You're not alone and not worthless.
