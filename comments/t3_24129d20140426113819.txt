You're right, it is a terrible way to think and feel. And you don't have to. Your bf right now doesn't care, and guess what? Even if you do have it, the majority of men simply don't care. And for the stigma, take it from someone who lived through it. It is not the end of the world. You will continue to live the life that you want. Pleasure will not cease to exist. All your dreams and aspirations can still be realized. The people who would ostracize you aren't people you need in your life anyways. And they could probably stand to gain maturity via life experience. If an insignificant bump on your labia means developing an unhealthy dependence on your bf, it seems there are bigger issues at play here. Consider seeing a counselor.
