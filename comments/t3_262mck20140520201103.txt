It's going to be fine! Weddings are easy to make conversation at. Here are some conversation suggestions:

- "How do you know the bride/groom?"

- "Don't you think bride/bridesmaids look gorgeous?"

- Talk about the decorations/location/food

- Talk about your cousin/any memories you have about her

- Ask people questions about their job/family/travel/study/children

People love talking about themselves. Old people especially love someone to chat to, so if you're feeling a bit panicky, maybe go up to one of your older relatives or anyone old and start them off with some family questions and they'll usually carry you away with chatter.

What I like to do is find a group of people and sit down with them, so that I can be "in" the conversation without having to contribute too heavily or lead it. If you want, you could ask your cousin to introduce you to some of the people she invited. If she doesn't, you could always just go up to people and introduce yourself as the bride's cousin, seeing as people love meeting everyone else at weddings.
