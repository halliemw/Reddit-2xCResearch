On some level you have to accept that this is your medical condition and there's only so much you can do to manage it. The consequences for not accepting this fact is a lifetime of self-loathing and the string of side effects that come with it: struggling with negative relationships at work and with men, failure to take calculated-but-useful risks out of fear, etc. But if you can learn to accept yourself, you can cultivate a happy life with people who value you as much as you value yourself. 

The "not a real woman" comment is inappropriate and hurtful, but you sound like a wreck already. And there's no man (or woman) alive who can fix that wreck but your own self.
