It's funny; when I was pregnant (with a wanted child), I became even more pro-choice. I think I realized how much investment a pregnancy was, and how much it affected a woman's body.

Also, my son was born premature (32 weeks) and my husband and I agreed that if we had a child born at 24 weeks we would probably withhold medical care unless there was a strong reason to believe that it would be effective -- we couldn't imagine putting a child of ours through that kind of pain. 

I don't think it's right to use abortions as birth control, but I don't think it should be illegal - would it be better for a woman making those decisions to have a child? How do you distinguish between a woman who got pregnant accidentally and one who was using abortion as birth control? And most importantly, how do you justify forcing a woman to give over control of her body and her health? Would you also regulate what she can eat, what medications she can take, how she gives birth, where she can travel in order to produce the best outcome for the baby? Those sorts of things are typically only regulated for criminals.
