I think you should take a photo of yourself today. Write down everything positive about yourself today: all the work you have done, all the gains you have made. All your dreams. 

Keep the photo and the lists close by, so that when difficult days come and self doubt arrives to knock on the door, you will have a strong image of your very best self to remind you that you can succeed. You can totally do this. Fear and self-doubt are just freaks that likes to show up now and then. They don't own your life any more!
