Try not to blame yourself. It's a horrible thing, but you needed to take care of yourself. I don't know what the procedures are like if you were to tell the police, but if it would make you feel better than perhaps you should look in to it. But mostly I think you should try not to feel guilty. I also let someone get away with sexually assaulting me. I now wish I had done something at the time, so I could prevent it from happening to others, but it's been so long that I'm in the same boat; I could never prove it happened so the pain it would bring me would be for nothing most likely.
