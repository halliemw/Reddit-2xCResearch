I just don't think it had a place in this conversation. There are many different reasons why they could have been so forcefully accepting of their daughters suspected homosexuality, despite her insistence that she is not. Who knows what inspired it, maybe when she was a young child they expressed homophibic views in front of her, only to regret doing so when they later began suspecting that she might be a lesbian. Who knows. I don't pressume to understand the motivations of strangers. I certainly wouldn't assume it had anything to do with "white guilt". We don't *need* to call it anything, to tie it in a bow and give it a label. They're human, sometimes humans make decisions that can't, and shouldn't, be easily categorized and explained, we're just to complex.

I just seems so troubling, to attribute any kind of benevolance shown by a white person to some kind of guilt of being born white. Dismissing peoples actions in this way is the very definition of racism. Assuming the worst about people that you have very little information about speaks more to your own character than it does to theirs and even more toubling, it feeds a culture of hatred and suspicion.
