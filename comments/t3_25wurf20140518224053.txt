It's rough to make friends outside of a spoon-fed situation like college. Another question you could consider is how good you are at understanding social cues, body language, etc. If you really want to, read How To Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie for an in-depth look at social situations.


It kinda sounds like you have your shit together and are just frustrated at being alone on the friend ship. I feel ya. You just have to keep putting yourself out there and tell yourself that you might have been lame in middle school (weren't we all?), but you're now an educated, kind, intelligent, hard-working bad-ass bitch. Putting positive energy into making friends will eventually reward you, and you just have to keep pushing yourself to be social even though it might seem like people suck. 

Investing time in people leads to friendship, so if you have acquaintances, ask them how they're doing and if they want to check out a cool thing happening in the area! I hope you find some bad-ass bitches just like you :)
