Maybe I should work on my explaining skills ha. I can totally empathize with you an your post. I do the same as you in friendships and the girls who I have been close with have fecked off for want of a better phrase, but its the guy friends who have always been there. They dont make snide comments or give you the eye when your out haha! Of course again Im not saying ALL girls are like this - just the ones I have been around haha. 

I used to feel really self conscious about being only friends with guys and got the whole 'slut' thing in school so years. But its at the stage now where.. why would i WANT to be friends with anyone (Guys or girls) who make me feel bad about who I gt on with?? It is ridiculous!
