If you haven't had a kid, insertion is going to be more painful because your cervix is more firm and tight. But it doesn't affect the rate of complications or anything.

To deal with the potential for increased pain, they can either inject a local anesthetic or insert it while you're menstruating (when your cervix is softer and more open.)
