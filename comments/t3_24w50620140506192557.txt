Unless they're not legal - there was a short documentary that talked about abortion in my country and one of the places where abortions were performed was an old and very unsanitary building with cats going in and out of it.

I myself had to have a medical abortion done, with illegal pills. It was done at my house and nobody knew what to expect. My mom had to take me to the ER when I lost so much blood that I lost consciousness.

Otherwise, yeah, you're right.
