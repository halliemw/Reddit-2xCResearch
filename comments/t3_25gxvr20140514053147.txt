I really, really hate the phrase "strong female character", because it conjures up an image of the stereotypical spandex-and guns-type that we pretend is super-progressive but is mostly just about T&A. A *good* female character is just like writing a good male character. Interesting. Multi-faceted. Flawed. Motivated. It's really not that difficult. At least, not any more than writing is in general, which is admittedly pretty hard to do well.  I think it was Neil Gaiman who said it best, when asked how he writes such good female characters: "I write about people." 

Y the Last Man has a whole cast of awesome female characters, and Sabriel is pretty cool too.
