I think it's more of a 'last straw' kind of deal. Women's feelings, behaviors and appearance are very often criticized by the general population in many subtle ways and it gets overwhelming quickly. Being told to smile does all three in one stroke and often comes from a place of ignorance, someone not knowing why that behavior is a problem, which is very frustrating. Its certainly not the worst thing that could happen, but it just makes everything feel so much more tiresome and insurmountable. How can we tackle larger issues, if such small slights are still so pervasive? It's defeating to think about.

Some women don't think much of it at all, just like you, but that doesn't mean that its acceptable behavior or that this woman shouldn't feel how she does.
