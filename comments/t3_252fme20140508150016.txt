Well, the pictures can be of whatever. They aren't typically posted for a critique one way or the other, but rather to share something though the image. I don't think all guys are critical or judgy, and my concern isn't just with men.  Being default will expose these pictures to more people of all genders. Many people won't understand why these images are being posted, so I'm interested/nervous to see the response.
