>debate is not what this subreddit is for

And yet there was plenty of debate before yesterday and there will plenty tomorrow. If you don't want "debate", post in a private sub. Or, safer, don't go on the internet and enjoy a debate free life.

That having been said, is there any way the admins can throttle PMs in the mean time? Do offensive PMers get banned immediately on review? They really ought to be.
