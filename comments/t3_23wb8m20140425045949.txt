Dude seriously don't worry about it! As someone with Mediterranean heritage and a greater than I'd like allotment of body hair I totally sympathize. But there are a few things to remember:

1) Ultimately, if potential sexual partners have a problem with it, they are not worth sleeping with. Yes, others are entitled to have their own *preferences* about their partner's body hair. But that is just that: a preference. You are the one who ultimately gets to decide what to do with your bush.

2) There are lots of people out their who like a full bush. Although I am fairly sure that this was not my current partner's original preference due to his fondness for performing cunnilingus, and because he loves me, he thinks I am sexy as with a hairy bush and now doesn't even want me to wax. This also stems from an understanding of point #1 above - empathetic people will understand the kind of work, time, and pain required to keep hairless, and understand that for some people, it's just not worth going through.

3) Related to the end of number 2 - when trying to keep your pubic hair "under control" uses up a large amount of your resources (money and time) and ends up being painful, is it really worth it? Is that really something you need to invest in in your life?

Sounds like you keep it trim and groomed. I think that is the best compromise. If it is something that is really affecting your self esteem I would look into a more permanent solution like laser hair removal. But just remember that porn-star hairlessness is not the be-all end all of genital appearance - and as someone mentioned - people often groom before going to the OBGYN and the sample of vaginas you've seen is not an accurate representation of the general population.
