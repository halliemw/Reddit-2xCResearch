In some countries other than the U.S. it's tradition for the bride and groom (or their families) to pay for the bridal party attire. I wish that's how it was here. But I've kind of accepted that it's not. I've spent so much money on my friends' weddings between gifts, bachelorette parties, bridesmaid dresses, and travel plans. If I ever get married someday I'm going to try to keep it extremely reasonable for the bridal party-- cheap dresses, local bachelorette party, etc. But I'll be on a tight budget since I won't have any financial help from my family and I don't make that much money. So I probably would expect them to buy their own dresses and shoes. I feel like this would be a fair exchange since I've done it for all of their weddings and I'll probably be the last one of our group to get married. But if someone couldn't I would understand if they didn't want to be a bridesmaid, or I would do what I could to help them afford it.
