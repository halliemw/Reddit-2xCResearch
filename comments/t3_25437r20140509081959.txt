Congratulations on your achievement! I was in a similar situation. Not dropping out but I've been dealing with a mental illness for a while--doing much better now!--and I wasn't able to complete the work for most of my classes. Luckily my program has very accommodating instructors. Came back for another year and I'm finishing everything up. Graduating in May! Feels good! 

Congratulations again!
