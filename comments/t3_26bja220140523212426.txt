I met most of my best friends online, all around the world (including my own neck of the woods), through shared interests. We are all pretty much introverts - I think one of them is not.

It's good to push yourself to try new stuff and to go out a little, although remember to listen to your limits too. Being terribly uncomfortable around other people because you've been surrounded by too many of them for too long is not going to help anything.
