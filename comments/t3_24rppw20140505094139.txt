Huh. I'm glad my father wasn't like this. Totally creepy, and makes sex look like a nasty thing you shouldn't enjoy, just endure in a marriage. My father's advice when I was 18 and still a virgin was "You should probably sleep with the guy you want to marry first... then you won't have any weird surprises when it is too late to back out." He was trying to be funny, but there was sincerity in his voice. Sex was never off limits when I was a teen, I was just told be safe about it. Mom got me birth control when I was 17, mostly for cramps, but she said she would rather me be safe than sorry whenever I decided to have sex.
