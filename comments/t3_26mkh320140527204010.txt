...As a survivor, I strongly suggest a safe word.  Something that would absolutely not come up normally during intimacy whether in good times or bad.  That way if she is uncomfortable or has a flashback she can end the encounter without mixed signals.  Also, make sure she is responsive throughout the encounter.  If she freezes, goes limp or her eyes glaze over then you need to check on her.  It is common for for survivors to go away inside during attacks and it may take time before that response dissipates.  Make sure she knows she is here, now, with you, safe and loved.  I very strongly recommend therapy to help work through this.
