Oh man, I had a major girl crush when I was about 17 and questioned my sexuality for months. I ended up coming to the same conclusion as you... loved being around her, wanted to adopt her qualities. It could be that this is the just the same thing, but it happens to be a man. I think that's where it gets confusing though! Thanks for your input :)
