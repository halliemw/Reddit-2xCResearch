Osama Bin Ladin?  Some people found him so sympathetic the joined his cause and were inspired to take other people's lives.  I'd say he's a real life male villain. 

Edit:  To be clear, I'm not saying I find Bin Ladin sympathetic, I'm saying the society he lived in did.  That doesn't mean he wasn't evil.
