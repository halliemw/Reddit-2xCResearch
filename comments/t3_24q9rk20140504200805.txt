I avoid using the "I have a boyfriend" line if it's someone I'm going to see regularly. My reasoning? They think that that's their only obstacle. Therefore, if I end up single again, they might take it as an opening, when really I was not romantically interested in them in the first place.

I used to do the same thing when I was a TA. Saying "I can't have dinner with you, I'm teaching your class" implied that once the class was over, they should try again. I don't like leaving loopholes.
