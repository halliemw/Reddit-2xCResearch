Dogs are great for people who  tend too much to live in their heads like I do. Dogs make you pay attention to the external and the right now. Walk me, now. Feed me, now. Pet me, now. Mine nudges my hand off the mouse if he thinks I should be playing Frisbee instead of redditting....

For me, recognizing that it isn't just me, but almost everyone really, that needs to make and keep their world manageable- whatever it means to the individual - well, that's what a lot of us want. I try hard not to want that so much- but instead to be open to what will happen if I'm experiencing, rather than trying to engineer my life.  Any how, you and I may have some things in common, and I'm way old, so I'll just say- it isn't so bad, because everyone is flawed and fucked up to some degree and maybe it might be something like this for you too: I found my insular tendencies to be more of a buffer between me and all the crazy I have encountered as I get older. Probably I'm a little crazy too, but there's some kinds of crazy that I just can't help or handle, so I protect myself from that.
