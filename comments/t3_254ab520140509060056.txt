* Most of the potential side effects can go either way depending on the person. In particular, the pill often makes PMS *less* of a problem, and sometimes it's even perscribed just for that reason. YMMV.

* It's totally safe to stop taking it at any time (as in, you'll have a period suddenly and you should stop having sex or you might get pregnant, but you won't have withdrawal symptoms or anything dangerous), so if you do have side effects, you can always stop and talk to your doctor and try something else.

* On that note, talk to your doctor. You need to see one anyway to get a perscription, it's their job to answer all these questions, and they'll have better answers than Reddit can give you.

* In case you're not already looking at this, typical use effectiveness rates for different methods are important. For most people it's easier to mess up NFP than the pill.

* There's nothing wrong with continuing to use condoms, instead or in addition! You can get them for free at your local Planned Parenthood.
