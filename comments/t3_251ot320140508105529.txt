This is one of my favorite videos.  Movie Bob does a great job of analyzing gender/sex representation, as always.  I've watched it before, but I'll happily watch it over and over again because he's right on a lot of points.  He also wrote that article that was posted yesterday about Tina Belcher of Bob's Burgers being a revolutionary TV character for young girls.

I don't think it's inherently bad that Katniss is coded as "male".  Like Tina, we see Katniss experiencing the world in a way that we identify as being "male" but the beauty is in how different their "maleness" is.  Tina thinks about butts.  Katniss doesn't.

Movie Bob is right in that the problem lies in femininity being an unwelcome "other".  Why else are discussions like women and video games relegated to /r/GirlGamers or other niche subs that focus on these "fringe" discussions?

It really comes down to "people are people too" no matter if that person wears combat boots or stilettos.  I don't care what's between your legs.  Femininity and emotion are not worthless.
