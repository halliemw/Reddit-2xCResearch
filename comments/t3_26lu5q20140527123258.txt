I deal with the ads about losing weight, etc by thinking: "Those ads are not talking to me. They are talking to someone else. My body represents what I love about life, and I'm fine with it the way it is." Repeat this mantra to yourself every time you start to feel influenced by society's pressures on your body image. Even if you don't believe it, think it to yourself! Over and over. Eventually it will become true, and the ads will not affect you anymore. They will seem like strangers trying to tell you things that you don't understand.

Keep in mind all of what you see that's pressuring you to feel bad, they are only trying to make you buy things. They don't really care about you as a person. You care about yourself, and you know what you want in life. Go get it, and give cultural pressure the middle finger!
