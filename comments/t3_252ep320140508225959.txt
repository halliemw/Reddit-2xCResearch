Yep, #1 surprise right here. I had 3 periods thinking I was crapping my pants before my mom (who did the laundry) told me she thought I got my period. Until then, I was putting toilet paper in my crotch/butt thinking I was having anal leakage a couple days a month. "Are You There God, It's Me Margaret" never said it would be brown. I read that book probably 10 times and not once did Judy Blume make it seem like it'd be anything but bright pinkish-red. 

Nope, looks like yoiu've got poopy racing stripes in your undies.

MAN I wish I'd had 2X in the 80s....
