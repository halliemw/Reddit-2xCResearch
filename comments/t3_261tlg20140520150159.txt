It sounds by your post like you enjoy spending time with this co-worker, and have spent quite a lot of time with her and her family. If you two are friendly, I would hesitate to just blow off the invite. 

Could it be that this was just some kind of communication problem, not a personal attack? It occurred to me that maybe it was a clumsy effort to instate a more covered-up dress code. Maybe she felt it was an awkward thing to request as hostess, hence the unnecessary explanations about stretch marks and staring husbands. I would try to just let the comments roll off your back and take it as a compliment. If it were me, I would just wear some cute shorts and a tank top and if someone complains about your stunning cleavage just laugh, tell them to lighten up and pour them a drink :)
