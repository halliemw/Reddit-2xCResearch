You are absolutely not the only one who still misses a parent after years and years, especially at big milestones. My dad died when I was 11, and it still hit me hard after I got engaged and called all my relatives and realized there was one person I would never get to tell. They will always be part of us, whether they're here or not. There's nothing wrong with you still missing her.
