First, I would ask your doctor if she will write you a one time prescription, just so you can stay on track.  I've had doctors do this for me in the past, especially when I already had an appointment scheduled.  If that doesn't work, you can always go in a buy birth control.  You don't need a prescription for it.  However, be prepared to pay a higher premium.  Birth control is only cheap with insurance.

If all else fails, then no, being off the pill shouldn't change your cycle too much (although every woman is different).  However, you will definitely want to use a back up method of birth control for probably the next 6-8 weeks.
