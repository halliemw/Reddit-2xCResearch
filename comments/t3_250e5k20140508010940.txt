Um, according to [here](http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r670_1.pdf) women's hair

'May be no shorter than 1/4 inch from the scalp'

And short hair is defined as

'Hair length that extends no more than 1 inch from scalp'

So basically what I'm getting is, that you can have 1/4 inch hair, or to fit better, 1/2 inch hair.

Is 1/2 inch hair really that hard to take care of of? (Honest question)
