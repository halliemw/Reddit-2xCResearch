can you clarify- the medical examiner said there is "obvious" trauma and "forcible entry" verbally. But is it in her chart? Has she requested the medical records?

Asking who else she had sex with is important because her boyfriends DNA could have contaminated any evidence left. It's standard. 

Additionally, rough sex, or sex without proper lubrication, or sex with a girth-y person, can sometimes leave tears in the vaginal cavity. So if her story seemed off, she was having sex, and the medical report didn't speak of large tears and whatnot, it could have been weighed against her report. Not saying that's what happened, just that it's a possibility.
