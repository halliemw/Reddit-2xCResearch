I get your point, but it is frustrating to have mine so misunderstood.  Of course, being unclean where others can see is embarrassing. (I always thought the worst was having a glitch, not knowing about it, and seeing it for yourself much later...like a bunch of gunk in your teeth, or a stain somewhere.)  But a period is not dirt, cannot be helped, and she was not in public, she was in a hospital room with people who should be able to take it all in stride...and it sounds like they did.  The thing that would bother me as a patient is them not closing the door.  The few times I have been hospitalized, the staff were incredibly polite and protective of my privacy.  Sometimes, when I read comments and posts on Reddit it seems to me that there are many women, mostly young, that seem very squeamish about their bodies and especially menstruation.  This seems sad to me, and so unnecessary.  I could understand her being upset if angryhaiku had been out in public and her period surprised her, but not in a hospital, not right after surgery, and not to the extreme of "I want to spontaneously combust and burn to ashes out of embarrassment. I want you to be stricken blind for having witnessed my humiliation."  This reaction makes me very uncomfortable, and more than a little weirded out.  Maybe being raised in the matter of fact way regarding medical stuff and bodies that I was has given me a more blase view.
