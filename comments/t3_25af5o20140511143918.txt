I'm so sorry for your loss OP. Your story is exactly the reason why I started a journal for my daughter the moment I found out I was pregnant. I still have my mother living but when I ask her stories of how I was when I was a baby or when I was young, she can't remember quite as much cuz memories do fade after time. I wanted my daughter to always have something to remember me with and how I was when I was pregnant not just for her first child, but for when I'm gone as well. I truly love your story and glad you still have something of you and your mom.
