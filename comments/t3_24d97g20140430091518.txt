I didn't read it that way...

> He's not that into sex. Okay, some of you may consider that a plus. He never pesters you to have sex. If you're not in the mood it's never an issue, **and you never feel pressured.** Except ... come on, a guy who never initiates sex? Who never brings it up? Who never tries to seduce you? You need to look into that, because it's definitely atypical.

To me it seems like she's saying "although it's nice to never feel pressured, it's worrisome if he never initiates."
