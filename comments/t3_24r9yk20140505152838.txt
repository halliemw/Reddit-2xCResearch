How's this for an easy rule?

If they're drunk, and you don't know if they would, or know they wouldn't consent when sober, don't.

If they're drunk, and they've previously consented when sober, but you don't know their thoughts about drunk sex, don't, and talk to them about it when they're sober.

If they're drunk, they've previously consented when sober, and they've made it clear in advance of this event that they're cool with drunk sex at this time, and they're eager in the moment, go for it.

(But if they're drunk, they've previously consented when sober, and they've made it explicitly clear in advance of this event that they're cool with drunk sex at this time, but they're **not** eager in the moment, don't.)
