There are 20 [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/findCenter.asp) locations in Wisconsin.  Are you near any of them?  Call the closest one and ask about what kind of emergency funding might be available (some states have it, some states have better funded PP's and may be able to help.  At the very least, they should be able to provide available resources you can get in touch with.)  Most of their services are provided on a sliding scale commensurate with stated income but I don't believe abortion falls in that category.  It's always worth it to ask, but you're probably looking at about $300 - $500 for the procedure.  That doesn't include an ultrasound if they require it, an initial screening with urine test, or of course any time off work and transportation to and from the clinic. 

Do you have any friends you talk to?  What about your parents or relatives?  Is the father available?  Having a support network, or even just one person for support can make this seem so much less scary and overwhelming.  You're welcome to PM me, I've done this rodeo a couple of times and I know how dark it can get when you feel like you're all alone in this.
