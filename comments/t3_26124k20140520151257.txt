My last pregnancy happened while I was on nuva ring.  I am now on an IUD and very often freak myself out with pregnancy symptoms.  It is really very easy to do this...  

Now, if your pregnancy symptoms start to get more freakishly real, like let's say your boobs are extremely sore (like more sore than you can remember) and you are feeling dizzy or having dizzy spells - you may want to take that test.
