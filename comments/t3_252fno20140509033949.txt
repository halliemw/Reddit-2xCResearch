> I like to think of this sub as a highly gender neutral and equal environment for everyone, whether they are male or female or trans or whichever gender they choose to identify with.

I was seriously hoping that would be what this sub was when I first heard about it becoming default. I was excited to find a place that focuses specifically on the issues and things women have to deal with. However, I'm disappointed that it also seems to be very hostile towards men, with several members outrightly stating that male opinions are not welcome at all.

I don't really see how that's gender neutral and I think this sub has a bit of an identity crisis. Is it geared towards women's issues or is it geared towards women's perspectives? It seems some people claim it's one and some claim it's the other?
