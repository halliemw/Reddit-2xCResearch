Yep - my doctor gave me a numbing injection and then made a small incision and tried to grab at it with forceps. It had wrapped around a piece of scar tissue and she couldn't get a hold of it. Took over an hour and during the anaesthetic would wear off so I needed a few top-ups. I lost weight on it (I think due to the constant bleeding). Getting it out was much worse than getting it put in. It's definitely on my list of "never again" contraceptive options.
