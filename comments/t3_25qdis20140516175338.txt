I really don't think it's absolutely necessary. Most employers these days don't even offer paid days off specifically for "sick-leave." Most I've seen will allow X-number of paid days per year of "personal time." You can use it for menstrual cramps, to get over the flu or to take your kid to the dentist â€” your call.
