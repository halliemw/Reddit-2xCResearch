There are definitely lines between "male" work around the house and "female" work. The problem lies in the female work being daily and time consuming, even if it's relatively light labour. Male work is usually something that happens weekly, monthly, yearly. Frankly, I'm glad I don't have to do that stuff. I don't want to be getting up at 7am in the middle of winter to move the garbage can to the curb. But is it fair to trade 3 minutes of moving a garbage can for 2 hours worth of meal preparation and cleanup?
