As much as compromise is necessary for a functional relationship, it should only be necessary to a certain extent. In theory, you guys ought to have enough in common that the two of you can both have fun while out with either one of your friends. Perhaps instead of compromising by having both of you do stuff you would rather not on a regular basis, compromise by doing stuff the both of you enjoy?
