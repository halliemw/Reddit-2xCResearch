When it comes to reserving a venue or getting a photographer, be prepared for everything to cost crazy amounts (make a reasonable guesstimate then double it). I'd recommend having a friend do the photography (if you want any) and doing the whole justice of the peace for the ceremony, and someone's house for a reception thing instead of using a church or actual location for either thing.

Take a look through Pinterest or the internet in general to see what is happening and what all the aspects are of a traditional/secular/outdoor/whatever wedding are and then start crossing off stuff you don't care about to figure out what really matters to you and your fiance.
