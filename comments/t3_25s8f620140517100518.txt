Seconded. In the picture from the article, I thought she looked quite nice, and then seeing the full outfit, people need to get over themselves. She looked great! She should wear that dress every year.

Also, because all I googled was "Sarah Millican dress" I got lots of pictures of her in other outfits, and she has great taste in clothing imo. I am in love with these shoes: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/03/article-2533419-1A67278100000578-102_634x910.jpg

TL;DR: people suck, this woman is awesome.
