From the original story, it sounds like there's no evidence the men ever actually said this, one woman said she'd give them impure thoughts.  This one woman seemed to have a vendetta against this girl.  It's also clear from the original that she wasn't particularly provocative compared to others:

> I was informed by more then one friend who stayed at the prom throughout the course of the evening that there was some truly dirty dancing, and that there were several couples making out and grinding on the dance floor, and yet out of a group of 500 people, only one person, (me) got thrown out for inappropriate dancing.

I wonder if it's really about the fact that it was an interracial couple, and this "impure" stuff is an excuse...

EDIT:  Also I feel bad for her that her blog post is now a big national brouhaha, dunno if she wanted that.
