It's more than an inconvenience, though. It's basically a prison sentence. I personally think removing the ability to have a choice takes away important rights of the parent. Surely one day we will have a 100% foolproof way to prevent pregnancy, but until that time are we to force people to take care of a child they didn't want to have, and a lot of the times are unable to adequately provide for?

As a pro-choicer I do not justify murder on all accounts, for example I am strongly against capital punishment. I think a person who can survive on their own, meaning not in the womb, should have the right to stay alive no matter what they are accused of. But if a person is physically dependent on another person to survive, and is physically inside of someone, that parent should have de facto "power of attorney" to decide the fetus's fate.

It's also a convenient time to think the decision over. When we place arbitrary early deadlines on abortion we force women to decide quickly to just terminate the pregnancy instead of being stuck with it. Give women time to think about it - but don't force them with bureaucratic regulations and hoops to jump through. Parenthood is a big decision and should be a personal one.
