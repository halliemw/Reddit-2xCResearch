> I think a good antidote for nerd misogyny is to learn how to have non-romantic relationships with others (male and female). Learn how to be a friend with someone, without an ulterior motive.

THIS! This is the crux of it I think. Many people seem to assume that if they like a member of whatever sex they are attracted to, they ipso facto should be dating them but that doesn't have to be the case. I have always believed that one should befriend a person before trying to bed them, at least if they want a relationship out of it. Strong relationships that last tend to involve two people who are friends *and* lovers (and in that order too)
