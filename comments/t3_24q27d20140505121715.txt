It sounds like you covered a lot in this talk... and meeting our partner's friends can help with jealousy issues, mostly it just feels like no one's hiding anything that way. Some of this is sounding one-sided though... what's the deal with his friends & your interaction with them? Needing to meet & approve of anyone you're hanging out with is still controlling. I have guy friends I don't live near any more - so my bf isn't going to meet them any time soon, and I'm not going to stop communicating with them in the meantime. It sounds like you've been doing a lot of compromising, but he's not really doing as much for you. Just be aware of how much you're giving up to please him. As long as you're not making out with them, hanging with your guy friends or having conversations with guys you meet at the gym or wherever, should NOT be dictated by anyone but you.
