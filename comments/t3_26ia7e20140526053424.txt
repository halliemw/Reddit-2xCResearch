I always wear a bra with the exception of sleeping. I've been every size from 34A to 38DD and my opinion hasn't changed.

I feel that the vast majority of women look sloppy without a bra. Clothing doesn't fit as well . There are very few braless women whose appearance wouldn't improve if they simply put on a bra. I think it just looks better.

Besides that, I personally find bras comfortable when I'm awake and moving around. I prefer the feeling of having everything held in place.
