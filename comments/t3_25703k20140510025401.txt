First, get off of 4chan. Second, get a new boyfriend and a new set of acquaintances. Once those two things are out of the way, consider therapy so you can figure out why you associate with people who treat you so poorly. Start treating yourself like you would a good friend, and distance yourself from anyone that doesn't show you respect. If you have all of that in place, it's 1000% easier to get over things.
