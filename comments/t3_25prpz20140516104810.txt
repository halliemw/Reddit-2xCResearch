Oh my goodness, yes; I need to work on my stance like whoa. The first time I shot a pistol, it looked like I was trying to run away from it while still holding it. -_-

What I was shooting was a K98k (with some Waffenamt stamps hiding on it), but we are inheriting a 10/22.

That program looks like a lot of fun! I'll have to check 'em out.
