He doesn't feel like he is entitled to it because he is male. It seems clear that the entitlement is just a rationalization due to rejection. He sought a narrative that empowered him, so he spewed that hateful nonsense because it soothed his ego. But he did not feel women should want him just for being male, instead it was for fitting into what he thought was the standard for male attractiveness. In fact, he questions the decision of the women to date men who are "inferior", so it definitely it isn't about being owed something for being male. Those other guys are males too, only they're broke/ugly according to him and therefore unworthy.

He overcompensated for his issues with material goods and by focusing on being physically decent looking. If anything, it shows that he did everything he could think of in order to attract women and dedicated his whole being towards fitting what he perceived to be their standards. It was his repeated failure that drove him deeper into his anger. If he really felt entitled he'd have acted confidently and been more assertive. How can you mistake the narrative for the fact? Taking the shit he says at face value when he obviously just constructed it out of desperation.

The whole alpha male shit is a broken rationalization, a narrative of empowerment from an angry kid who faces chronic rejection and nothing else.
