I've dealt with similar feelings. My mom is also very overweight and has numerous health issues, including hypothyroidism which exacerbates her weight issue. When I was younger, I used to feel guilty for my mom's weight because I couldn't help her get healthier (I wasn't very healthy myself). As I grew older and realized the importance of individual choice, I came to the conclusion that I couldn't make my mom be healthy. I can do what I can to encourage her, but ultimately, it's her choice and she needs to decide to do the work if it's what she wants.
