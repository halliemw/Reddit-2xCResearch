I would talk to your doctor about it. Your body is basically already "confused"- you're giving it extra hormones to trick it into doing something it's not supposed to do. With skipping periods, you are keeping the level of the drug constant, there's no sudden lapse where your body goes "Oh.....it's gone? Guess it's time to bleed now!" 
It doesn't really make a difference to your body if you skip one cycle, or a bazillion of them, it's not a "real" period anyway. 
The only thing that gives me the jeebies sometimes is that because I never bleed, I always think there's rank uterine lining up there that's been there for 2 years. YECH! When in reality it doesn't just sit and rot up there, much like the eggs that don't get used, it (I think) gets reabsorbed back into my body. 

(Someone with more at hand medical knowledge can flesh the details out?)
