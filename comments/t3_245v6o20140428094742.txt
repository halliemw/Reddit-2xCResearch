I leave my gender unposted on any gaming site that allows me to. That way, people meet me as "Cloudedguardian" before they know me as "The young lady, Cloud."
People generally assume I'm a guy, and those that figure out are usually fellow girls, or the normal, sane gamer, who is happy to walk a newb around and talk about One Piece.
