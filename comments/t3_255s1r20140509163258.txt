<<<If you are the type of Christian fundamentalist that fights for legislation imposing your beliefs on mine, then you and I will not get along.>>>


Like you, I vote in line with what my values are.  

However, a relationship with Jesus cannot be legislated nor would Jesus want that.  

If I don't like people just the way they are, then I am not a very good follower of Jesus.  That's my take on that.
