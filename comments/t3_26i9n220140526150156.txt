It doesn't 'easily' count as neglect.  Neglect did not occur.  The child was not unattended.      
 
>CPS is mandated to do what's best for the kid, so if they decide the parent is fine, no harm done.

Agreed that there is no harm in reporting, but other commenters calling for OP to make multiple reports and calling this "tremendous" neglect are getting a little circle jerky.  Lady took advantage of a babysitter.  No need for pitchforks.
