I can see that view, but discrimination in an industry is pretty shitty, and we shouldn't limit ourselves to only criticizing or fighting *the shittiest* things on the planet.

Should we not fight discrimination that keeps women in lower paying positions or prevents them from getting hired because they're of child-bearing age and *might* get pregnant because there are women who are forced into marriages and beaten and oppressed in other parts of the world? I don't think so, but maybe you disagree.
