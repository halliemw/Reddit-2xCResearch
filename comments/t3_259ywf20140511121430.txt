It's more of a thing that happened in the past, when weddings were smaller and no one was expected to invite as many people as we invite today.  It was a chance to acquaintances to celebrate and shower the bride with gifts and no one used to take offence, well, not officially anyway.

BUT since you got a "save the date" for the wedding date I'd assume there was a mix up and your invitation got lost.  Do you know any of the bridesmaids or her mother?  If not I'd ask the bride directly.
