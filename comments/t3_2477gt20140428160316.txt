Ya it's a weird feeling that it was so easy to build a life together but so hard to take it apart. 


Did you break up and move? or was it a break? I could stay with my family temporarily but in the event that we break up, I don't have a problem finding a place on my own. I guess it's just sad that not that long ago I was on my own, and now I'll be alone again. I guess the difference this time is that I'll have a cat.
