"You see corgi_sloot, your mother and I always wanted a boy. So when we had you, and found out you were a girl, we were in a dilemma. I said we should just throw you out and try again, but your mother grew attached to you after seeing you. In the end, we settled on giving you a sex change. Now go grab me a beer and take the trash out."
