Your story is full of massive red flags. He impregnated you against your will - he's willing to put your body through pregnancy in order to get what he wants, and he's going to try and deny you your right to choose whether to continue with the pregnancy. This sounds incredibly abusive. Please tell someone you trust about this. He sounds very controlling and you've said in other comments that you want to leave him. You need support in case his behaviour turns even nastier.
