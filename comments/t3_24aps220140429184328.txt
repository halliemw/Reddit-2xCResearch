The Yoko one makes me upset also. People shit all over Yoko Ono without just cause. Yes, the Beatles were a great band, and yes, Yoko and the other wives might have contributed some friction, but when you have four very opinionated people working together, the odds are that that arrangement won't last forever, especially if each wants his own avenue and creative niche.

Being mad at Yoko Ono for breaking up the Beatles is like being mad at Eva Braun for the Holocaust. She was, at best, tangential to everything that happened.
