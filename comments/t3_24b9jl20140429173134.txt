I got off hormonal birth control and switched to a copper IUD two years ago. I acted like a different person when I was on birth control. My mood swings were crazy. 

Now that I have the copper IUD, I just get really cranky and emotional before and during my period. But it's a *steady* stream of cranky and emotional â€” not tons of mood swings. 

My periods are heavier and more painful but at least they are my own. I don't have high blood pressure anymore (the BC was raising my BP). I love not having to worry about taking my pill or getting my shot.
