I'm sorry this happened to you.  

Assuming that you're in the US, you need to check your state laws immediately for the statute of limitations in your state. I believe you can press charges at any time, even though without evidence there is probably not much that can be done.  It is still beneficial though, to have his name on the record in case he tries to do it again to someone else.  I would also suggest you to get some type of counseling so you can assess the best therapy for you, if you wish to do so.  Also please remember that it was not your fault.  Nothing you did or didn't do could have invited this.  I wish you all the best and good luck.
