Armpits... maybe once every week or two, and whenever I wear a tank top on top of that. So, more in the summer, less in the winter. I wouldn't shave at all outside the summer, if I weren't such a monstrous sweatbeast. 

Legs/bikini, maybe... once a month? Six weeks, even? I dunno, rarely. I only shave downstairs at all to prevent period gore nastiness, and very occasionally as an extra special treat to my boy-person.
