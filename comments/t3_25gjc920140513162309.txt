We've talked about it before in depth. He's got his pros and cons. And I definitely see where he comes from. 

Let me start off with saying I am leaning towards his point of view based on what we discussed. He had good points, a lot of which did apply to me. 
He didn't make his decision based on religion, which I believe is a good thing. He mostly chose not to have sex before marriage because of pregnancy scares and partially because of trust issues in his past. 
The pregnancy scare thing is a real concern for me since I have had that happen before. And I have actually had a miscarriage before (which is pretty much the worst thing to experience in your early 20's). So I am totally on his side with that. 

But I can't really make my body/hormones think logically and agree with my brain, and that's what I'm struggling with.
