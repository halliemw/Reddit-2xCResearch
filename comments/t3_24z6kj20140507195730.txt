My point still stands. People who make irrelevant comments on posts demanding/threatening that we meet their expectations else be labeled a circlekerk are not welcome here. That's what is happening here; they post something they know is going to set people off and then accuse them of being close minded; this is a classic manipulator tactic. It is a manipulative move/trap so yeah I'm not gonna stand for it and label it for what it is; a hostile invasion.
