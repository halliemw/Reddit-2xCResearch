Talking to the guy about what happened could work, at least you might save another from being groped if he didn't realize he was being a major creep. But reddit isn't your only social opportunity. Take some classes together at a community education center, volunteer somewhere or try another meet up website. You haven't invested that much in the group you can start over even though it sucks.
