No I haven't, but I might, because a lot of people is suggesting and I think you (and them) are right about this being some consequence of a deep fear/traumatic event. The latest of one I have lived, and I thought it wasn't affecting my current life that much, but now I see it might have lead to a deep fear I'm not aware of.

as per my bf part, is not that I want another boyfriend. I am happy, I love him, I don't want to lose him. But sometimes I ask myself if that's all, if that's the maximum happiness I'm going to have the rest of my life. No novel-like romance, no love adventure, no more first-kisses... at 25? But maybe I'm just expecting too much from life. And I know that probably, with all my relationships I will get to that point. So why throw this one into the bin if it's not a problem of the relationship itself, but a "problem" with me?


He's embracing my changing lifestyle and supports me wholeheartedly, but he does it to make me happy. His personality is totally oposite of mine. If he's good at some place he doesn't need to make changes. 0. Me instead, if everything is good, let's be joyful for it during some time.. and then let's try to improve it. I keep looking from jobs/apartments from time to time even though my job and apartment are top notch. I know that changes makes him feel insecure, because he's afraid at some point I'm gonna "change" him as well.  
He supports me into going to pursuit my happiness, wherever it is, even if that hurts him, but I just don't want to be that selfish.
