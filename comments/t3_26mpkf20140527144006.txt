I think they look pretty normal. I won't tell you whether you should or shouldn't like how they look, but I do think you are being quite hard on yourself. 

Unless they are causing a functional problem (with breast feeding in the future for example) I would just try to come to terms with the fact that they look "normal." Normal doesn't mean you like the way they look, it just means they aren't weird or abnormal.  People have all kinds of nipples and yours are certainly in a normal range.
