> Although I don't think geek men of the 1980s and 90s were a paragon of feminism, geek culture was nowhere near as infected with hateful misogyny as it is now.

I don't disagree with you at all. In fact, my post wasn't arguing that things aren't worse. It was arguing that pointing at "Dude-bros" or "new people" as the problem is inaccurate, in my opinion. The real problem now is that the internet is large enough to focus the misogyny in the same spaces. To have a circle-jerk of douchebaggery that allows you to start with a shit opinion and allow that to grow to a whole series of them. Rather than in the past where that shit opinion was likely to be shot down by some other random person in your much more limited circle of influence.

The problem is that the internet's popularity has allowed the shitlords to coalesce into similar spaces and breed more shitlordery.
