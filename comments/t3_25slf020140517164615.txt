When I worked there,  I had a GM who would throw things on the floor for female staff to pick up.  The worst was customers though.  I was one of the only female salespeople,  and I was full time. I'd have customers ask specifically for a man and I'd be like well if you want to come back tomorrow at 5, there will be a man working.  I was totally shocked when at one point I had a woman who asked to speak to a man.   Women can't know anything about electronics!!/s
