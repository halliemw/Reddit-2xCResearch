I live in Vancouver... it's a city where Asians are actually are a slighty bigger % of the population than white people (I can't remember if this is in the metro area or just the city itself) and there are *definitely* white guys who self-proclaim that they have "yellow fever." And what do they like about it? That these women are apparently more reserved, worship them, treat them like they are their children (feeding them, doing their chores), etc. Seriously, men who want these kinds of women just want a mother they can fuck and boss around. It's ridiculous. There's a fine line between what you described and what I described versus a guy who tends to be attracted to more "girly girls" and if a guy wants a girly girl then that's fine, honestly. But I don't think being feminine should encapsulate ideas of worshipping your male partner and being submissive to him because he's The Man and the idea that some guys target an entire race because that's their expectation of the women makes me grumpy. I'm sorry you have to deal with that :(.
