Chalking up someone's professional success to an insinuation that they've used sexual favors to get it is absolutely sexual harassment and as long as you ignore that fact, I will patronize you until the end of my days.

You'd have to be willfully blind or just an outright misogynist to not see the sexual factor in that type of workplace inappropriateness.  Champ.
