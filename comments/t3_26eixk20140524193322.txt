Its conclusions? I have never been one to argue against it but I have heard people that say it isn't a real science and all that stuff, I was just wondering how you usually combat that sort of criticism. I guess [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#Criticism) are the kinds of things they are critical about, but I can't say I have listened much to the people that doubt it though because psychology has never interested me much.
