It hurts so badly the first time! But stick with it and it will get better...you could always do a French wax or something similar for the first time if you can't handle it. I wax myself every other week and I absolutely love the results-it is way cheaper than going into a salon and if you do it often enough there isn't much hair so it's not painful at all.
