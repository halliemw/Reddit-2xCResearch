Can I please just say that I don't think your experiences are male only? I can identify with a lot of what you've said, and I'm a woman. I had plenty of guy friends through high school, but none of them were interested in me in "that way". And it really sucked. I wondered if I'd ever find someone who found me attractive. I'd heard all this stuff about girls being able to get sex whenever they want, but it wasn't working for me. I wasn't overweight, I wasn't particularly pretty but not hideous. What was I doing wrong? I felt so lonely. 

I eventually lost my virginity a few months before I turned 20. Still with that guy. And realised that it really wasnt a big deal - I just hadn't really matured enough to be ready. I realised that there was practically no difference between being a virgin and being a not virgin. An arbitrary social marker doesn't matter.
