...yes? Would you be saying the same thing if this were any other crime?

The judicial system, including the police and a jury, determined student A did not steal student B's laptop. We should still force student A to move to a new home?

The judicial system, including the police and a jury, determined student B was not killed by student A, as student C claims. Evidence points to accidental death. Student A should still be removed from class?

Edit: Sadly, false rape claims happen. Anecdotal evidence, but a friend of mine started fooling around with this girl in undergrad. One day she told him that, if he didn't make the relationship more serious, she'd claim rape. He told her he wanted to stop seeing her. A few days later, he was moving all his stuff out of the building.
