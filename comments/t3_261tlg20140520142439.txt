I don't think it qualifies as adult bullying, if so you need thicker skin. But definitely pull your coworker aside privately and let her know that you're uncomfortable with her request. If she and the rest still insist on it, then just don't go. Why should you have to spend time and money to pander to their insecurities? 

And learn to not let anyone guilt trip you. That's just something you need in life.
