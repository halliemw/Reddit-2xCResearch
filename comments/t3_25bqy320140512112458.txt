A lot of men I talk to have no idea this happens to women or they don't think it's a big deal.  I didn't know for a long time that it didn't happen to men too.  I just thought everyone got yelled at by people passing by.  It took me a while to figure out that it's generally men yelling at women because it's not an advertised incident. It happens, you react or don't react, you go about your day.  Maybe you think about it later and feel angry.  I just think we should talk about these things more so more people are aware of how prevalent this is.
