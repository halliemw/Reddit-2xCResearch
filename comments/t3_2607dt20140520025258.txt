I had one inserted about 3 weeks ago now, and am still getting the occasional cramp and am *still* bleeding - which I would usually be worried about, but my doctor told me it could take a while for my body to get used to. I have a check up in another 3 weeks to make sure everything is ok and it's still in place though.

From everything I've read, lots of different people have different reactions to it. However, if you're really worried, go see your doctor. :)
