My two child-free friends have one as do I (one vaginal birth). My childless friends seemed to hold up better with the whole thing than I did!

I don't know how you react to pain meds, but for me if I took them before the procedure I probably wouldn't even remember why I was there until after it was over. Percocet AND xanax? You'll want to go back and have another one put in. You'll be fine!!
