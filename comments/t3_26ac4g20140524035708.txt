Interesting - what you say is pretty contradictory to the vast majority of research on the wage gap. 

Yeah, yeah, in general but you see...in any statistics, you control for moderating factors that may alter the relationship. 80% pay gap is actually shown to be fairly accurate. 

Here's a little citation for you: "Family-Friendly" Fringe Benefits and the Gender Wage Gap"
Lowen, AaronView Profile; Sicilian, PaulView Profile. Journal of Labor Research30.2 (Jun 2009): 101-119.
Read that and try to tell me a factor that was controlled for?? BTW: controlling for something means that you make sure that factor is identical in both the groups you're comparing). 

Also: yeah of course education has to do with the pay gap. Hence why you control for it, and demonstrate that at the same level of education, pay gap favors men. Obviously, if one gender is more educated, that needs to be addressed, but that doesnt negate the pay gap. 

Side note: I really miss when studies listed the probabilities that their results were due to change.
