I thought it was the case they could click a button. I get the vibe the main complaint is that women talking about women things with other women, is hugely offensive to a select few men, who think that somehow by talking about our experiences we invalidate their experiences. And they are just dropping in to let us know they feel invalidated, you know because we might want their advice about how a woman centric sub should go because it is just impossible that a woman centric sub could be run by...women.
