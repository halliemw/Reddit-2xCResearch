Oh honey, I'm so sorry. I know you are portraying this as the shock you needed, but I realize it's got to be really rough and I'm sorry you are going through it - not just catching him cheating, but the whole relationship. I'm glad you are out.

The first thing that pops to mind is that some HIV tests can detect in 6 weeks - you should look around and try to find one. It's a lot better than waiting 6 months on an old test. Chlamydia and gonorrhea should show up pretty much immediately, I don't know about syphilis.
