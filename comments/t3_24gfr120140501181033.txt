Professional comedian here! 

A lot of writing is to establish "callbacks," and even on one-liners what you're looking to do is create "in-jokes" with your audience. All comedy is something you can identify with. Mostly gags will get cut if not enough people can identify with them. 

No matter how oblique or surreal the gag: you're always the person on the outside looking in and thinking "How WEIRD."
