What the victim and her supporters are calling for is a punishment that fits the offense. They are saying that being suspended for just over one semester is not proportionate to what the school found him guilty of. There is no call for him to go to jail or to have to register as a sex offender. There is a call for the victim to be able to finish her education without having to worry about running into her attacker on campus.
    
I agree that issues like this should not be handled by schools. Personally, I think victims often choose this route because they want to minimize damage to the attacker. If there were more "criminal" options besides having to testify in a court of law and the attacker being labeled a rapist for the rest of his life, then-I think-more victims would take that approach. Instead, the victim chooses the school route so that the punishment to the attacker is minimized but the victim does not have to be "re-victimized" by the court or by having to see her attacker regularly.
    
In a sense, getting rid of the school option before generating other options may be "worse" for attackers in that it will encourage the victims to bring criminal charges even when all the victim really wants is to finish her schooling without fear. I am not making a judgment on this, I am just making an observation.
