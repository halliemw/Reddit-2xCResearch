I think you are majorly over reacting to this. There is currently no legal precedence set for this type of thing. Men are not legally required to pay for half of an abortion or for half of maternity care. You would also have no way to prove the pregnancy resulted from sex with your significant other from a legal stand point. 

You can ask him to contribute and it would be nice for him to do so but he is in no way obligated to. You can try to sue him if you feel it's necessary but odds are all this is going to do is end your relationship.

My advice is to go to the hospital, apply for charity care, and work out a payment plan with them.
