I mean really.. just insist on meeting his friends at a time when other SOs will be there. Doesn't have to be out of the blue or last minute - honest talk, you want to meet his friends. They're important to him, they bring SOs, shouldn't have to be a big thing.

If he's worried you're going to start crashing every guy's night out, you can emphasize you just want to meet them, not go every time.

But if he really starts acting weird or trying to avoid it... that's weird. Don't let it go. Don't just let him "not follow through". Bring it up before the next time he's going to visit - ask if the next weekend trip you guys can both go. 

There is really no good reason to not ever meet his friends. If it's just a "guy's night out" ask him in advance to do something different. Whatever makes sense for you guys. Dinner. Clubs. Movie. Drinks. Wine tasting. Hiking. Doesn't matter - just something that isn't a "guy's night out" and with expectation SOs would be brought.
