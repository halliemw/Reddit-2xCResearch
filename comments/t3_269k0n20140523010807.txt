For some reason I feel really uncomfortable about the fact that every photo in this article is stolen from a dead woman's Facebook or screengrabbed from the very porn that might have put her over the edge. Is it ethical to take these images? Is it legal? I honestly have no idea, but it just doesn't feel right to me somehow.
