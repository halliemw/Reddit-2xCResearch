It sounds to me like you've got some anxiety issues. I have the same problem, but with my friends and family. I constantly worry about them, and fear that something bad will happen to them. I would honestly consider reaching out to some counseling resources, and maybe researching some tips about managing anxiety. There's no simple way to get out of this way of thing, it's a long process that requires you to challenge yourself and to re-train your brain to think logically and rationally, and you will still have days regardless where you feel anxious about these things. But you can learn to manage it, I promise. Therapy has helped me immensely, but I obviously understand that that sort of thing doesn't work for everyone. Play around with some different techniques and ideas; a quick google search will turn up tons of information and resources for you.
