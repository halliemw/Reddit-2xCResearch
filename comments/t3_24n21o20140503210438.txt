It's juvenile manipulation and it's best to ignore him. He sounds like a little kid who got told off for calling the girls poopie heads, was told to be nice, and decided to take all his toys and play with the boys instead. That'll show them. Look what you're missing out on! I'm ignoring you! 

Someone like that isn't long for the employment world anyway. He sounds resentful of what others get, which means he isn't focusing all that much on what he's offering.

You may have spotted a redpiller in the wild.
