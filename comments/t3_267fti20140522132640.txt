> I believe the main criticism is that these women have bought into an inegalitarian belief system rather than they are being forced.

Sorry, but words fail me. Your statement shows a lot of ignorance about the various shades of the muslim feminist movement. 

Many many Christian women consider themselves feminists despite the mysogynistic stuff that is in the bible. 

Why can't you trust muslim women to do the same? 

Your statement is a prime example of the thinking that is the problem behind struggle number 27 above. 

You also might want to read the writings of Fatima Mernissi, she covers some ideas on the feminist muslim spectrum of thinking.
