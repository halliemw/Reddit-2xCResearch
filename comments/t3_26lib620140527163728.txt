It's almost comforting to know someone else went through similar things I did. Comforting is probably the incorrect word; nonetheless, it's good to know. my best friend in elementary/middle school had a fascination with writing erotica, and using dolls, as well as other phallic items. It ultimately led to me becoming involved out of fear of losing my best friend, then our friendship dissolving altogether. It's interesting to know there were other people out there like her.
