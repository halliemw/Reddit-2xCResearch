Well that is still true. The idea is that you have freedom of beliefs. On whichever subject you like, and really, there is no limit on that.

When you start acting on those beliefs and that it starts affecting other, however, that's where the problems start.

It works for everything. Drugs? You take them, your own choice. You make someone else take drugs, there's a problem. Sex with underage people? You can believe all you like on it. When you start acting on it, with other people, that's a problem.

Abortions? You can believe it's totally wrong to have an abortion and no one should have them, or that it's totally right and everyone should get one. Once you start trying to make either happen, by coercing other people into it - shame, guilt, shady morals, and that goes for either side - however... there's a problem.
