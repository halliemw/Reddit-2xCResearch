I know this is a bit harsh against guys. But In my experience its SO hard to get a guy to keep using condoms once he's tried going without. It feels different, most say better, for them.

I think I just gradually grew to feel safe when nothing bad happened. and I found I could follow taking the pills almost exactly right. 
 We don't use condoms much anymore, but my SO is very good at holding back and pulling out, and doesn't seem to mind finishing himself off. If he wants to finish inside he puts on a condom. 
  If I've missed a pill or been more than a few hours late, we use a condom. 

I think I feel more comfortable now mostly because I have a partner who's very respectful of my wishes to be careful and does his bit too. a previous partner was a bit of a dick, trying to coerce me into risky situations and showing little regard for if I got pregnant. I completely could not relax because of it. 

I'm also in a country where abortion is illegal. While I probably would be able to get to the UK, the whole ordeal of having to fly over and stay is just so much worse than getting it at home. I never want to have to go through it.
