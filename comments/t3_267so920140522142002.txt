there's an episode on the podcast Inquiring Minds where they talk with Mary Roach, a science writer who has written a book about our digestive system and poop.

Anyways, they do talk about probiotics, and I believe Mary says that its most likely more or less ineffective due to the small amount of bacteria you're introducing into an already large, stable ecosystem inside of your gut.  I'd guess that the best way to change your gut flora/fauna is a combination of a diet change and probiotics.  Or a poop transplant.
