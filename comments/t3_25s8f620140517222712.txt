Magazines that target women are full of this and the ridiculous thing is that the majority of the writers are women. Its not just men that contribute to gender inequality but women too. How can we expect gender equality when proponents of the opposite are of all genders? Even reading the experiences of transsexuals makes me believe there is a powerful stereotype of what the female gender should appear as and how those of this gender should behave. It's cool to see this comedian talk shit about this problem but I bet the ones criticizing her appearances were mostly women. Makes it hard to believe.
