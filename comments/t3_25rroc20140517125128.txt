Of course this is just an opinion and I may get downvoted for expressing it. (quite a few posts are deleted here - a bit worried)

I understand the message and no one should ever throw anything at you, but it's still vulgar.  Children attend the event.  Parents attend the event to watch their children graduate from 4 years of hard work.  Not to have their pictures and memories marred by sexual organs drawn on graduation caps while they watch in the stands.  There's a time and a place; this isn't it. 

If we were supporting breast cancer, would it be ok to draw a pair of breasts on the top of my hat?  If I were supporting rectal cancer, could I draw a detailed anus?  

Edit: for grammar.
