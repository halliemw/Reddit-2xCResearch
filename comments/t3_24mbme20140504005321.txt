Went out of town for a month for work, so I wrote letters to my SO. Of course, we talked on the phone and texted and everything, but it was still so nice to have something of his to read and keep on me. 

May I also suggest /r/fountainpens? There's nothing like writing a nice letter with a gorgeous pen!
