If it's only about money, I would've gladly worked with them to figure out a solution.  I think that my COO, given that we had worked so closely for so long, should have had enough respect to discuss the situation with me.  We'd certainly come up with unorthodox, yet successful, solutions before, so I'm really disappointed that it didn't happen this time.
