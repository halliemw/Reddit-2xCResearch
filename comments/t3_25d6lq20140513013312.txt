Marriage is more than a title. It's a big bag of legal benefits and protection tied with a fat rope of social recognition. It's also putting the unspoken promises (of  loyalty and cherishing and love) into actual spoken words. 

It gets pretty jarring when you think of your SO as the love of your life and your life partner and then you have to name him to others with the same title a 14 year old uses for a 2 week fling. 

Just go to wikipedia and check writers or famous people personal life sections. Automatically wives get much more prestige over even a 20 year old "friend". 

And if titles don't matter, why do people get PhDs and not just work as a research associate.
