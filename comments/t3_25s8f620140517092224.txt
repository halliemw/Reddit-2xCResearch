I googled her dress after reading this (the full outfit, not just the photo shown in the article) and I honestly don't understand what all the fuss is about. She looks gorgeous, that dress is lovely, and honestly who gives a fuck about her shoes, considering you could barely see them? I'm pissed off that assholes on Twitter made her cry, and I'm pissed off that this kind of thing happens ALL THE TIME. She made an effort to look her best, she purchased a dress that made her feel beautiful, her pictures show her beaming in happiness, yet people tear her down. And why? 

I just don't bloody get it. I'm glad she wrote this article, and I'm glad it was shared. But I'm so angry that she needed to write that because of the asses of the world. 

Also, did I mention I REALLY like that dress?
