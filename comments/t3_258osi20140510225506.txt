Thank you for bringing this up. My mom shot herself when I was 21. I'm now going through feeling pretty angry at her. I've been engaged since October, never had a father, and it's pretty fucking hard to imagine getting married since I've had difficult relationships with the rest of my family. The hardest part is not having someone be completely on your side. Loving you no matter what. And you're right, it's hard to never be able to get to know your mother as a person.
