Many of us have had to deal with this.  So stick with it, it gets better.

Also, you should stop and think about what is important.  I know it seems like you are young and you have lots of time, but people asking about this may be thinking about you.  Having kids does "cost a lot of money", if you are concerned about living a certain lifestyle.

Saving money for a house, a wedding, etc may seem like something very important to you.  It may seem like the most important thing ever.

Put it this way, if you decide to wait another 3 years before you start thinking about kids, you'll be 27.  If you start immediately, at 27, and go off birthcontrol, chances are you can get pregnant right away and have a health baby.

But if you put it off, and put off, by the time you get to age 30, and decide to start trying your odds will take a deep dive.  If you've still not had your first in 8 years, chances are you never will.

So, work on your plan, but do put kids on the plan, whether or not all your hopes and ideals are realized.  There may never be a perfect time to have a baby.  But if you wait too long, you may miss the opportunity.
