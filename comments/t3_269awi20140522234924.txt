One thing you could do is go see a nutritionist. I did when I was pregnant, and I learned a lot from it. Also, drink water. It's important sometimes if it gets overwhelming and personal to take care of yourself, think of your body as a machine or an object to take care of. You may not psychologically think you need to eat, etc, but if you can grasp cerebrally that you need to feed your body, and keep it nourished, maybe that would help.
