How do you feel about having blood drawn? It's less invasive than a full on pap and pelvic exam, but you still get the full gamut of STD testing done (just be sure you state you want to be tested for *everything*). This would also be a good way to check out a doctor's office you're interested in, and you wouldn't have to really be examined.

If you were my friend I would really encourage you to get 1) counseling and 2) at least a pelvic exam, but if they're all up in there anyway might as well get a pap since it takes like 2 seconds. I would even volunteer to go with you and sit there and hold your hand while you get examined. I would also sit with you while you were at your counseling session if that would help you feel more comfortable. It's something that I view as extremely important.

My family does not go to the doctor unless they've broken something or are close to death. This leaves me with very little medical history for my family. At the point my family members died it could have been from a whole host of things, because they all *thought* they were perfectly healthy. If they had a doctor they could even call up just to be like "Hey, I've had this headache for the past week, is this something I should have you look at, or should I just keep taking my advil?" They might not have run into as many problems down the road.
