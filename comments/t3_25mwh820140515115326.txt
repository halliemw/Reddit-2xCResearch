Oh man, please don't stop wearing your short shorts when you wanna, and don't blame yourself by saying "this is what I get"! God, society is such a bitch for teaching us women that it's our fault when someone else is a dick. 

You don't deserve abuse hurled at you. Ever. Even if you were walking down the street stark naked singing "I'm Too Sexy." 

Fuck the haters. Rock your short shorts. I wish I had the confidence (or the thighs, for that matter). One day I will. (Um, the confidence, that is. I'll never have the thighs. I like beer too much.) Until then, you've gotta wear yours proudly for me, okay?

I know it probably won't help, because the guy's intentions weren't nice, but I think being a hussy is awesome. I'm gonna cross-stitch it in girly script for my wall. HUSSY. Because if you're a hussy, rockin' your short shorts, it must be pretty cool, right?
