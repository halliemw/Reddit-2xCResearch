>Ask your fucking superior for a demonstration

I agree, unless your superior is a man who is allowed to shave his head or a woman who doesn't have coarse/kinky hair. You're the one who said it could just get "pulled back in a bun" which demonstrates your lack of knowledge. I'm not "bitching," I offered a practical solution that you didn't address--offer women the option to wear their hair the way men in the army do. How can people "improvise" if they can't chemically straighten their hair in the field and aren't allowed very short hair?
