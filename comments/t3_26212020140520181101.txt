I don't think you can label the actual feelings of disgust as right or wrong, no.  Why would you?  Personally, I believe that the switches for what people find disgusting are, in part, genetically set (see Chomsky's views on this, he's not far off).  So, while I think that people who feel disgusted at seeing X in public are sad (I start feeling sad), there is no instant billborad in my head that says THEY ARE WRONG or THEY ARE BAD.  No, instead I feel sad, and, if they make their disgust really known, I feel irritated.  My feeling irritated does not make something else wrong - I need more than my feelings to make such a judgment.

To me, right and wrong are judgments, I am not sure what you think they are (I'm guessing, reading between lines, that you think they are feelings).  I do not think they are feelings.

Similarly, notions of validity, truth, sound argumentation and the like *do not apply to feelings.*

Feelings flare up in the brain in the limbic system in complex ways.  How we connect up to those cognitively is a separate issue, the feelings just are.  They are there.  

I don't really care (no feeling involved) if you feel that some part of my post detracts from another part.  You're not using the word "valid" in a way that's familiar to me, so you're using it in your own way - which is cool, but I certainly do not know what you mean by it.  To me it's a construct from statistics, and my comments are not related to statistical norms - or to argumentation.

I'm just stating some observations and feelings.
