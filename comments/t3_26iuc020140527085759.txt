Personally I don't think it's possible to work full time and be an incredible parent; mother or father. I would agree that to gfully immerse yourslef in your childs life then it is neccesary to take time off. I think career choice has little to do with it as long as the house hold can be supported during the break. I also think an excessive nest egg should not be an excuse to those who wish to justify not taking a break in order to be mor invlved with their kids. Just my two sense.
