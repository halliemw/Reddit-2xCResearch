I think to start you should avoid using the term "faking". You said it yourself that you enjoy sex you just don't climax. Let him know that your responses to what he does are still enjoyable you just aren't able to finish and that you still greatly enjoy having sex with him. Don't put him down by saying that you've faked it, making him feel as though the sex was disingenuous. If you are willing to try new things thats something you and him can discuss, but don't make climaxing the focus of sex, this could lead to much disappointment and a feeling of failure if you do not find something that makes you finish. Sex should be fun and it seems like you have fun having sex with him, so emphasize that and don't make the climax the end all of sex. To be super cliche, its about the journey not the destination. Hope that helps, and you are able to have a healthy conversation with him about it. Best of luck to you.
