So this popped up on the reddit front page and I doubt anyone will even see it at this point but I just wanted to share. I am a guy and in college I was an RA. During my time, I had 3 girls report a rape to me and a 4th who didn't want to press charges. On top of that, I stopped a girl from drinking a drugged drink at a frat party my junior year. Anyone who believes in the false accusation bullshit has never actually dealt with a girl who went from the happiest person in the world to insanely depressed in a spam of hours. This shit happens almost regularly and its disgusting. The issue is societal. Many men have been taught that their masculinity is based on their sexuality and this has given many a sense of entitlement that they don't deserve. This is extra prevalent in frat communities where groupthink keeps the guys from calling each other on their predatory behavior and in the military (of which I'm a part). To get at the rape issue, you first have to address the societal issue that allows many perpetrators to not even think of it as rape. 

As an aside, I knew a couple of the rapists I had to deal with as an RA. Many of them ARE charismatic and that is the other issue. People find it hard to believe that Joe,  the nice guy down the hall, could do something so evil but what's the first thing the neighbors always say about serial killers? "He was such a nice man and I didn't expect it"

Sorry for the rant but remember that many men are not rapists and a lot of us do not condone the false report BS either.
