MagicShave. 


I swear by it. It's like veet but the smells of chemicals are much less, and it has never burned my skin. I use it in lieu of a Brazilian bikini wax at the salon.


It was originally made for black men with bald or shaved heads to remove the stubborn regrowth. It looks like a lotion tube. You will probably find it in your black men/women hair care aisle.


I promise it will change your life.
