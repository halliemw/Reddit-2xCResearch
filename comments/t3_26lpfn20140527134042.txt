> If I had kids to take care of 24/7, I think I would feel less useless, but kids are like 4-5 years down the road for us

The work your boyfriend is doing now is setting himself up for success down the road.  The more he can front load his career, both the higher he can climb that ladder, and the more money he can bring in for the family.  It also means that when you two have a family, he's in a much better place to support multiple people, not just you two.

You are working as a team.  He can't front load his career unless *you* give him that opportunity.  That's entirely on you, and that comes from working together.  In other for your household to operate, there is a set amount of work that has to be done.  That work has to be done regardless of you being at home or you being someplace else bringing in extra money (dishes, vacuum, grocery shopping, etc).  If you are at home doing that work, A) you two get to spend more quality time together, b) you don't take a big an income hit when you have kids, c) as I said earlier, you two are setting him up for a better career, which will enable him to provide for you and your family better when kids come into the picture.

You are very lucky.  

*edit* another way to look at it is this way....  think of how many executives have the same assistant for 20 or 30 (or more) years, even between multiple companies.  Why is that?  The assistant may make a lot less money then the executive, but that doesn't mean the executive doesn't lean on them any less.  Every great executive assistant that I have seen speaks AS that executive.  They are a team.  The assistant isn't a secretary, they aren't a gate keeper, they aren't just someone that answers the phones.  They are someone that operates as half of a whole.  One can't do their job without the other.  When one leaves, the whole things breaks down.
