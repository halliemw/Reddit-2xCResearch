Wow, holy crap. I feel like the overall message of this was "give your husband lots of blowjobs, and never ask him to do anything".


How about, relationships are about give and take, and people of both genders are different and have different needs?


The bitching one pissed me off the most. Literally nobody cares about the goddamn toilet paper roll, that's such a cliche. But if someone says they'll take out the trash, or that's their chore, and they don't do it? You have a right to address it. Geez.
