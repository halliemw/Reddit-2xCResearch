That's fantastic! I started at 260 and am right at 208 right now myself, lost in about the same time frame as yours, so I definitely know how you're feeling; it's absolutely incredible! How are you getting that dress to lose weight with you, though? ;D Because I've definitely got a few gorgeous plus-size pieces that I will be a bit sad to shrink out of.
