More likely scenario, some guy mistook it for his place.  Key wouldn't work or forgot it, was going to climb in the window thinking how lucky he was.  Chances are there's a very embarrassed person out there right now thinking 'shit I nearly broke into somebody's home'.

Happened to me a couple times when I lived in an apartment.  I was home, suddenly someone just walks into the place.  They got the wrong door.  Oops.
