I relate to my mom fairly well now that I'm an adult, pretty well even, but it's still kind of weird.  We're both people who were diagnosed with autism at a late stage (pretty recently for me), so that made for weird relations when I was a kid.  Like, I didn't even like for my parents to touch me.

We do still get on well though.  I realize this isn't very similar to your story--just wanted to reiterate that there's a whole spectrum of relationship types that people can have with their parents.
