That's where the appetite analogy comes in. In the long run, it doesn't matter if you feel hungry because you saw a picture of a Big Mac, as long as you choose to eat something way better for you than a Big Mac. Or you could compare it to style inspiration: it's fine to want to look like a Chanel model, as long as you stick to your budget and buy your clothes from H&M instead of running up credit card debt.
