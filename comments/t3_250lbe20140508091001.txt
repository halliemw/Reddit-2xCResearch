I have hair similar to what OP describes. Very, very thin and and extremely fine. In my experience, dry shampoo seems better for people with normal hair that has some weight to it. Usually, when I wake up in the morning, my hair is already looking oily and because it is so fine and thin and has no weight to it, it sticks in whatever shape I slept on it. Like this morning, I woke up looking like a blond, less stylish  Edward Scissorhands and it's not going to settle down flat again in a bob unless I completely wet it and restyle it, at which point I might as well wash it again. Also, dry shampoo looks really powdery in my hair because it is so incredibly fine.
