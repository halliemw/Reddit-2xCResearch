Refrigerator pig is supposed to be kept in your fridge. When you open the door, the light turns on making it oink. It's a not so subtle way of saying "You are a big fat fatty who doesn't need to be snacking" probably meant for the chronically bored snackers. 

I don't know why someone would buy that for themselves...
