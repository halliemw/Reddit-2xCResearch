Dear Brother,

Sisters are always cute and the obsession of care is pretty obvious for brothers and fathers. I luckily have both daughter and sister. So can understand your concern. 

However your culture is very different from mine as children of so young ages are not promoted (sort of not allowed) to use internet, social networking sites etc. which have other benefits (discussion on this is beyond scope). 

I would like to ask you do a harmless experiment with your sister. 
Find out that from what things (good things or habits) she is frightened of. 
Like going near to animals such as dog, cows, deer etc. or fear with water or fear with big machines, fear of going out alone, fear of interacting new people.

After findings, ask her to confront that fear (obviously in your full supervision and sometimes hidden supervision). If she overcomes the fear 10-12 times. She'll gain much confidence. Ask her to use this confidence against her bullies (in constructive manner).
Like ask her to be confident in whatever she wears. Because whatever she wear makes new fashion. Tell her fashion models every time wear new things. If they think same then new fashion trends would never come. So for gym shorts ...hello Ms. Atheletic. Try to tell her to love herself as much as possible.

Your problem very much seems of having less confidence in herself which need to be nourished as you can never be with her everywhere and in every aspect or time of life. So need is to make her confident enough to face odds of the world.

Abhy
