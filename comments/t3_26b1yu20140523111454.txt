Work on loving and accepting your body as it is but change what you eat and how you exercise to improve your fitness if that's what you want. You wont start magically loving and accepting yourself just becaus there is a smaller number on the scale. I think dieting in the traditional sense can be really detrimental to confidence and self-esteem. Restricting and calorie counting and all that is something that people can rarely stick to. Whereas changing eating habits to be more healthy and well-rounded and doing physical activity that you find enjoyable can continue for a life-time.
