My first car was a piece of junk, but I loved that 89 Riviera. First, everything was controlled by a computer touch screen, but the screen didn't light up. So, I had to memorize where everything was. That was always frightening to passengers. 

One night the poor Riviera wouldn't start. Got out to check the battery and realized the battery cable had a short. Wiggled it and got on the road. Problem? After so long on the road the vibration would move the battery cable around again. The car would die, everything would shut off, including the headlights. I had to coast to the shoulder, pop the hood, and wiggle it again. Did this all the way home. 

All of these car problems would pay off when I see a young woman who can't get her fairly new car running. The car won't crank over and I can see that she is scared. I went over to her and told her to lightly flutter the gas peddle while starting the car. Bam! That engine started purring and she looked at me like I was a god!
