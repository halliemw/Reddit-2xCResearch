I'm a man who is a former janitor here, and I think I might be able to shed some light on this:

I asked about those machines in our building once, since I wondered if restocking them was on my list of things to do when I cleaned the bathroom, and was told the following, more or less:

"Those were a bad idea that are stuck around in just about every damn building like this in the country. They were broken into so much, the company who originally sold them went out of business. But it costs too much to rip them out and rebuild the wall. So, they just sit there. I don't think one of them's been restocked in decades, I can't imagine anyone taking it upon themselves."

There you have it.
