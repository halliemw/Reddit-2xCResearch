Unbelievable! S/he should have their licence revoked. 

I hope, OP, that this person hasn't turned you off counselling all together. Of course I can't presume to tell you what's right for you, but I just wanted to say I found counselling really helpful after living with an emotionally abusive family member.

Thank you for sharing your story, and I wish you all best.
