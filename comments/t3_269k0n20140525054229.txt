I'm not arguing against laws banning continual harassment or stalking by an individual, so none of what you just posted has any relevance.

I'm saying that you can't ban online bullying without restricting legitimate and non-harmful speech, largely because the "bullying" would likely be a group effort by many unrelated individuals, many with no real world connection to the victim.  I fully believe that legitimate harassment and stalking can be treated just as it is in the real world, but that doesn't mean that unintentionally coordinated actions by a bunch of mean people online can be legislated against without banning anything "mean." (i.e. if you espouse some terrible political view and I call you a fascist, should the legal system silence me because I was mean to you? even far more ugly cases with the possibility of a civil lawsuit shouldn't mean that some private party could benefit from an organized system of censorship for unverifiable insults)
