It's not too say that I'd want to know out of anger, but rather deep concern at my child's growth and development. It's sad that we do have to fear strangers and I encourage making connections, but I would also want a daughter to have a healthy instinct to not let things get so far. As soon as I hear swimsuits, I'd nope right out of there because that would hit an alarm I'm my head that something is not right. It's a reality that young girls get preyed on, as sucky as that reality is.
