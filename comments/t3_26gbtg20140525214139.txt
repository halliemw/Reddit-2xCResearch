Grow a pair and just say no.  I would define the experience as you being too afraid of being alone to deny your ex-partner sex.  If you can't be around your partner without ending up having sex, just stop hanging around him.  If there is any other reason to be around him, there shouldn't even be an issue with just saying no since you obviously have some sort of emotional connection.  If  your relationship is just sexual there is no real reason to continue to be around him unless you want to have sex with him.
