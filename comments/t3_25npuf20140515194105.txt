Seriously try an epilator. I'm hispanic with lighter skin and my pit root hair would show under my armpit skin also,  I saw this video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twf1oNpceF4

I was apprehensive at first, and immediately regretted doing it after trying it...it kinda feels like torture at first....but after a week I noticed I hadn't shaved all week...and when the hair started to grow out again it wasn't as thick.

That was about a year ago and I still use an epilator every week. I recommend doing it at night before showering. I just wash with soap and water.

They're about $40 on amazon.
