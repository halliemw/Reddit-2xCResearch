>But I've always felt a disconnect between us.

Same here.

My parents aren't monsters, but they aren't the nicest people either... although they pretend to be. Because of this, I spent much of you childhood keeping out of their way. I never formed a connection or any trust or love for either of them. Our entire family participated in birthday and Christmas celebrations, however the entire thing always felt like a theatrical production.

My mother had a nasty childhood and I suspect she wanted children so she could vicariously make up for what her childhood lacked. I think my mother was able to satiate this need early in my childhood and continued to raise me because she feared being judged as a bad mother.

I haven't spoken to my parents in over a decade.

I severed communication with them for several reasons: because I'd had enough of the pretending and watching them pretend, I realized that, if I were rushed to hospital in need of major surgery, they would be the last people I would want to entertain and I would never want my parents to come anywhere near my children.

I have never missed my parents or sought advice or comfort from them, although I do occasionally wonder if they are still alive.

I have as much interest in seeing my parents again as I do with any other anonymous strangers.

These things just happen in life, so please don't feel bad.
