If you are a full time college student, I highly suggest looking into the counseling services at school. If you feel alone in this issue and just need an objective opinion or listening ear, that could help. My college allowed walk ins for any reason, and you weren't obligated to schedule multiple appointments.

This is your choice and you obviously don't want to have deep regrets about deciding either way. Sometimes it is just helpful to talk to a real person and say your fears out loud. If you decide to go through with it, then a counselor would also be helpful.
