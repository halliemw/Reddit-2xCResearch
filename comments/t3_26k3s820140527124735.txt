We do tell folks that they are entitled to a lot of stuff. That sense of "entitlement" is usually just a pathetic thing to see on children and young adults. I saw it in my brother's ex-wife, and she spent some time in prison because she "deserved" what she took and was resentful towards the victims for not giving to her what she stole. 

That "amazing and happy life", that gets called "The American Dream". It gets pushed by lots of social propaganda. 

Two words we need to eradicate from the American vocabulary are "deserve" and "entitlement".
