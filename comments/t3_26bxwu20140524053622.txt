It's goddam terrifying. I'm a 6'3", 285lb man and if I had that level of aggression coming at me from multiple assailants I'd retreat into a storefront or into a group of nonthreatening strangers immediately. If it was an everyday thing I'd get series about utilizing my concealed carry license. 

Last summer my mother had to stop walking in the mornings because a man driving a car was basically following her and repeatedly circling whatever block she was on. And this was at six a.m. in a rural community. She fortunately had the good instinct to step onto a porch and call for dad to come pick her up. Retelling the story curdles my stomach.

I can only imagine with the constant potential threats a young woman would deal with in an urban environment. Just thinking about it makes me want to check my window latches and get a pistol out of the safe.
