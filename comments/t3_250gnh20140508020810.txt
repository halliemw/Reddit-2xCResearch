I call them rubber bands sometimes, but only if the context is very clear that I don't mean, you know... the office supply. Also, my grandma kept using actual rubber bands in my hair when I was really little, and then my parents had to cut them out at home, so I'm always quite wary of calling hair thingies rubber bands, lest some hapless person, you know... stick an actual rubber band in their poor child's hair. Traumatic stuff.
