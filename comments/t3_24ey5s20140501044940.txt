I have sort of a bubble butt, and I had a big problem finding slacks as well. I wear a pair from Ann Taylor Loft (they have pretty good sales on occasion)that I really like. They sit right above the hips (so slightly high waisted) and while loose from the hip down, look good and elegant. I'd suggest there.

Honestly, I found clothes at stores that are marketed towards women aged 30+ (I'm 24, so not the usual stores I'd shop at), as opposed to a younger market, have clothes that are designed to fit a more developed body. I also looked at Talbots and Macys and found some I liked there. The only exceptions to this rule I've found are J. Crew and usually Banana Republic.
