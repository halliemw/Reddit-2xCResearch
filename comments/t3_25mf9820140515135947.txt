I don't have my ears pierced, you're not alone! :) Personally, I don't think I'll ever get my ears pierced. I'm just not interested in it. Originally, my dad wouldn't let my mom when I was baby because he felt that it was my choice. I'm glad he did because as a child, they kind of grossed me out :P

So did the dot for a lowercase "i". I was an odd child.
