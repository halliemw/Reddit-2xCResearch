I actually didn't read that one! 
The books I read were more explicitly "this is what puberty is" - 

The Care & Keeping of You and The Care & Keeping of You 2 - these are published, I believe, by the American Girl company

I had another book that I think was a YA offshoot of Our Bodies, Our Selves... when I googled that, I came back with "Changing Bodies, Changing Lives" - the title is familiar, but the cover image isn't what I remember it looking like, but it could be the same book.

I bet if you go into your local children's/YA librarian, this is probably a request they've received before.
