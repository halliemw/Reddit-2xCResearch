It was just changed. Sergeant Major of the Army Chandler's biggest focus for soldiers seems to be appearance. New tattoo standards, new hair standards, civilian hats may not be worn indoors when off duty, nail polish is forbidden, and a bunch of other stuff. DA PAM 670-1 is another place you can look for updated rules.

Based on the SMA's demonstrated priorities, I would not expect any changes without Congressional involvement.
