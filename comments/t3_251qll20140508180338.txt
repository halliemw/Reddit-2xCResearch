I think feminism is stigmatized. That's it, though, point blank: if you care about women's health, ideas, opportunities, and safety as much as a man's, then we need more people you! Feel comfortable to identify how you want, but that's what feminism is to me. If you've been reading along, you probably noticed the **huge** majority of feminists commenting here, men and women alike, aren't out to bust balls and rule the world. They just want equality.
