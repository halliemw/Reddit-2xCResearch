^ This. I logged on to say just this. Only about 25% of women can actually achieve a g-spot orgasm during intercourse.  But a huge portion of men think that every woman can and if you can't, then you're fucked up. Society has it so backwards.

That being said, you should let your man know that you haven't (and maybe can't) have a g-spot orgasm. And let him know there is nothing wrong with him, and there is nothing wrong with you. He should know how much you enjoy sex with him. At least that's my opinion, take it or leave it.
