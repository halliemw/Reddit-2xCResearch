Tell the department. This is completely unacceptable. If you are worried about evaluations just wait until you get your grades back and then go let the department know directly. Someone needs to let them know (Im surprised someone hasn't yet). There was a professor like that in our program who would routinely inhibit the progression of women students, often to the severe detriment of their research projects. Im sorry to hear about this, good luck.
