My male partner plays games like that but whenever I have it was gender ambiguous or I was playing on his account and not using a mic. He plays one game a lot and the people on there say the most horrible things. I'm sure this is in a lot of games but it really disgusts me that all these people are calling each other f**s and n-words and all that kind of stuff just constantly and he told me the offensive things they said when there was a female voice on there one time. I don't know if it's supposed to be funny or what but it's sickening that these games bring that out in people. Sometimes I want to go on there and question them about it but I guess when you're anonymous you just want to troll and not have a genuine friendly conversation with anyone. I can play a game without insulting my rivals and especially without resorting to such offensive vocabulary but it seems like it's a competition with who can be the most offensive on there. So even though the idea of playing games with other people seems somewhat appealing it's just a given that they're going to be horrible to you if they know you're a woman so I don't bother.
