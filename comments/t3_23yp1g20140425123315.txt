Congrats!  A big bonus to nursing older babies is the weight really starts to fall off.   If you are thin already break out the chocolate because you will need the calories.  My youngest was born May 15 of 2013 and is still nursing too.  Our babies are pretty close in age.  I usually nurse until 20 months or so.
