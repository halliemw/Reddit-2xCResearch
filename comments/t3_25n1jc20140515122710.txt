You should go over to /r/tryingforababy.  =)  

It is weird, the first few weeks.  You spend your entire adult life avoiding pregnancy and suddenly you're actually trying for it.  It takes some adjusting for sure!  TFAB has tons of great info and a really supportive group of people.  I don't know what I would've done without them!  I'm 9w pregnant right now.  =)
