I've bought plan b a couple of times and the first time, in my small, southern, conservative town, I figured I would be judged harshly for buying it. However the clerk was incredibly nice, asked if I'd ever used it before, then told me how it would work. She also told me about possible side effects and wished me luck. I was pleasantly shocked. The other times I've bought it I have never felt judged or shamed at all.
