Outdo him.

"I can't imagine why you're single"

"Its so sad how you never learned how to associate with women"

"1950 called. They'd like you back"

"Have you ever been around a woman that didn't find you annoying? Besides your mom, I mean"

And my favorite for such situations:

"Fiance doesn't think like that. That's why he's getting laid and your not"

That last one usually leads to vehement denials and insistence that they are getting laid. That's when you sarcastically bring up their many girlfriends in the Niagara falls area, breakfast club style. Adjust to your locale as appropriate.

That method tends to shut up sexist, but has very little effect on non-sexists who are making those jokes just to be ironic. But if he's the second type, they usually listen and tone it down when you say flat out that it bothers you.
