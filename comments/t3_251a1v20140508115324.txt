this has to be carefully thought through. Anyone making minimum wage is almost certainly receiving food stamps and some other assistance. If they make more money then they would also pay more in taxes and possibly get less in benefits each month because of the raised wage. So who wins in this instance? The government does because they are a)getting more revenue in the form of increased taxes and b)they are paying out less in benefits. It also serves as a control mechanism to mask inflation.
