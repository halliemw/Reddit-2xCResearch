I'm really sorry this happened to you. :( I was honest with my mother at 17 about having sex with my boyfriend of 2.5 years and she pulled the car over and cried. I completely understand regretting being honest with your mother. 

However, don't let her make you think any less of yourself! Don't let her reaction stop you from speaking your mind in other situations! You have every right to speak your opinions and your opinions are valuable!
