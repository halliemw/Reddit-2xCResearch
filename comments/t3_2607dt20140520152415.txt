Your uterus is getting used to having a foreign body stuck inside it so it's to be expected that you'll be cramping for a few days after. The cramps shouldn't be severe any longer than like four days though but you should expect some lighter cramping to be going on for about a week.

Even after having a Mirena IUD in for the full five years I was still cramping for a few days after getting the paraguard inserted. 

Perforations are excruciating I hear. About as painful as you'd expect a piece of plastic tearing through your uterus to be. 

Take some ibuprofen and have a hot water bottle handy and you should be fine.
