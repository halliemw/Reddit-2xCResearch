Yea I know... It just doesn't make any sense. When you think about it, they can't put someone in jail which means they can't carry out any meaningful justice, and if it IS investigated by police and found to not have enough evidence or the accused is exonerated, disciplining the accused just means they are going to get sued (and they will very likely lose). It's a lose/lose for the university and for the victim (and possible future victims). If my daughter had this happen in college, I'd encourage her to go to the hospital and then the police immediately. In real life high schools don't handle rape trials and neither do employers... Why should universities?!?!?
