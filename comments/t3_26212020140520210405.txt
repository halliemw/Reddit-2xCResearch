[Support] threads are the online equivalent of when your friend is going through a rough patch and asks you for a shoulder to cry on and some positive words.

Sometimes in such a situation, you might give some friendly advice/context your friend might have missed, and that's probably ok here too.  Use your judgement and proceed with caution.

Where it becomes not ok is when it crosses the line from "hey, here's some extra information that might help you be less upset about this" into "you're wrong to be upset/you're a bad person/you did something wrong"

Does that make sense?
