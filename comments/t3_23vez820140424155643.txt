Thank you.  I in no way was trying to start shit or saying, "lol no, you're stupid and wrong you dumbass" I just had one problem with how something was worded and I really do regret even saying anything about it. 

If anything its been an insightful glimpse of forgoing polite discussion in favor of the tactics OP was making a point about. I mean, it's kind of funny in a post about how shitty people can be on the internet and lo and behold, once someone posts something that's not a glowing agreement then it's fair game to use abusive language.
