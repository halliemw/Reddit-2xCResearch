I love watching women's weightlifting. So inspiring. I have a friend who's been doing a lot of lifting with her personal trainer and is well on her way to competition. I don't live that near her anymore but I told her if her first competition is on a day when I'm not working I promise to be there. 

EDIT for grammar
