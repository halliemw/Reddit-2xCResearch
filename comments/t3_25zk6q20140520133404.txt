Ms. specifically does not connote marital status, and replaces both Miss (as used to name a woman who is no longer a child and also is not married) and Mrs. Just as men do not change their title upon marriage, the use of Ms. allows women the option not to do so. 

I am a little surprised I have yet to see any mention of the old feminist dialogue about "woman" as a word being based around "man," and the use of womyn being preferred.
