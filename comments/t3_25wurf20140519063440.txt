Holy crap I got 42, anything above 32 is apparently definite :/ I could feel my heart sinking as I answered the questions though. Like...yup. I never even considered something like this until now. Just thought I was weird :(

At least you've noticed improvement in yourself though, and you know now that you can work on your skills :) best of luck to you!
