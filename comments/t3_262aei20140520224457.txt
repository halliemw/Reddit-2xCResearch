Look, I got pregnant when I was 17. I seriously considered abortion but I just knew I could not go through with it myself. I loved that little bean more than myself already and it wasn't even a thing yet (found out at around 2 weeks pregnant) and it turned out to be the best decision I have ever made. I get where your coming from. 

But I'm still pro-choice. Some people just are not in a position in life to make good parents, and adoption doesn't always happen right away, especially if they have medical issues (and the older kids get waiting to be adopted the less likely they are to ever be adopted). I come from an area with high teen pregnancy rates and a lot of my former friends who now have kids are fucking terrible parents and I feel really, really bad for their kids. I also know people who have adopted children and are shitty parents because they had this idea of what having a baby would be like, spend so much time, money and energy on getting this baby and it turned out not to be this fairy tale so they become totally lost on how to take care of this baby. 

Just think, your friend who has had 4 abortions, how could she be a responsible parent at this point in her life. She can't even be responsible for her own contraception how could you trust her to raise a baby? I mean sure, she could totally get her shit together once she had a baby because sometimes children do that to a person, but is that really a good roll of the dice?
