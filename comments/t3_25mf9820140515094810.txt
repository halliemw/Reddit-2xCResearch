I have really sensitive skin and a nickel allergy, and possibly another undefined metal allergy.  I've found through a lot of trial and error that I can only wear sterling silver or fine silver, surgical steel, or platinum.  I can also tolerate a stainless steel watchband, though that took a lot of trial and error - I had a watch that was labeled "stainless steel" but it was really only stainless steel plating, and the plating wore through and the underlying metal gave me an allergic rash on my entire forearm that took over a week to go away.  My current watch is a Skagen with a woven stainless steel mesh band - very obviously, nothing plated or hidden in the construction.  I have ultimately found that I just can't get more affordable jewelry pieces if I want to avoid reactions - I only purchase items where I can be assured of the proper quality and labeling.  I also have prescription steroid cream that I keep on-hand in the event that I do have a reaction.

I've noticed that I have to be careful about checking the actual jewelry when it comes to sterling silver - sterling silver should always have a "925" stamp/mark on it somewhere (for rings, it's generally on the inside of the band), though sometimes earring hooks won't have the marks and still are sterling silver.  For my engagement ring and wedding band, I worked with a custom jewelry designed and she used a platinum alloy that is less known to cause metal allergy issues.
