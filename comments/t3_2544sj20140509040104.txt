I'm worried it has to do with the fact that it's always a talking point, so presenting it as news and getting people's opinions will always generate clicks/sell papers. I quit reading SMH a few days ago when they posted one woman's opinion piece on how she didn't want her children sitting next to men on airplanes, and presented it as front-page news.

There's always going to be a vocal minority on issues like this, particularly when other nations like the US are talking about it and it makes world news. What we can do is write to and call our state and federal politicians and express our opinions when things like this come up, and be mindful of who we vote for.
