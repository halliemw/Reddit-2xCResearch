>No. In my country, there is only maternal leave. No paternity leave. It isn't even a concept. Men are expected to have nothing to do with babies for the most part. The leaves they get aren't given to them by law but by the companies (private ones mostly) because people give family a LOT of importance here.

Then your country is far from progressive, it's downright backwards.
