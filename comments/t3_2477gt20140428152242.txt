the example really is what happens every. single. time we talk about anything. I'm not exaggerating. There is never a good time. The discussion always goes the same way it does as the example, I'll raise an issue, he'll get defensive, then we fight. Then he'll apologize for being defensive and then we'll have a rational discussion. I don't understand why we can't skip the miserable part if the end result is the same. At this point I'm not looking to salvage the relationship. You have the same kind of fight for 3 years it's just not worth it anymore.
