The concern as a male is that you will be viewed as a threat. If I am going through a ghetto area, I have to be careful to avoid eye contact with the wrong people, who might try to start something as a dominance play.

I do carry a switchblade when I go out in public though, so I am confident I can take care of myself if someone gets too threatening.
