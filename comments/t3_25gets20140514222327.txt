try to take anything i say with a grain of salt. i am very rationally minded and am not good at recognizing my own emotions. i realize that most men don't share my preferences for women. i think i will go move to the philippines and go find some youthful looking 25+ year old pinoy catholic girl who is a closet atheist. 

so yeah, not exactly common for other guys to have my interests. i want a girl who looks young, has an old mind, has a lot of life experiences, has seen the rigid rules of society and conforms enough, but still thinks for herself. thats a tall order to be filled. a little too particular, but thats the type of person i am.
