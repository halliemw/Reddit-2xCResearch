I feel like I'm struggling with my bf with that right now. I feel like death from the period, he says things like "oh when I'm feeling drained I look at my diet"...um no. That won't help. Actually I'm so nauseous I can't eat a lot. Thanks though.

Bless him that he's at least trying to relate, but it doesn't help and I find I get bothered by it.
