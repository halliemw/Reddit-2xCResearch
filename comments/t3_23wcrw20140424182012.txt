I'm 53, my sister is 4 years younger. She looks so much older than me.
I am a techie nerd and work a ton. My sister was one of those blonde tanner types. She had Gorden Ramsey forehead lines and just had them removed. Now she looks like bozo the clown.

I don't have any except fine lines around my eyes. I've always dabbed vitamin E on my face and stayed out of the sun. 
Even in blazing Texas.
