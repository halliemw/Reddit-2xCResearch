I'm not trying to argue with your experience at all, just trying to share mine. The guy who told me to smile didn't stop and make a connection with me either, though what might have set him apart was the "everything will be alright" that he added after it. He DID call me beautiful if I remember correctly, but it didn't feel objectifying or sexual.

I don't think it's often meant in a malicious way by other people, but I don't doubt that it CAN be malicious. All in all, I'm sorry your experience was so hurtful :(
