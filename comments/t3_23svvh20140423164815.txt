Not to be a dick, but I thought Tinder was used for casual sex. If she got all these messages on OkCupid fine be mad, but, maybe the men think that since she's on a sex site, that she'd appreciate some raunchy message from them, since I guarantee the men on there would be pretty stoked to get a raunchy message from a woman.
