My mom was 41 when my brother was born. Of course she's younger than your boyfriend would be, but now she's in her early sixties and still keeps up with both of us very well. She's always taken care of herself, and I think if your boyfriend takes care of himself, he could probably physically handle being an older father well. The person you really need to discuss this with is him. You should also know that men do have declining fertility and that as the man gets older, risks of some developmental disorders do rise, but not generally to an unsafe degree.
