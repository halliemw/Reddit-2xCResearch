God that sounds so incredibly frustrating.  He really is acting like an idiot if everything is as you describe.  He's potentially causing himself permanent harm just because he can't bear to stop working out for a few weeks.  

He doesn't have to stop working out forever, but after a concussion you really should take it easy until you recover.  If I were in your shoes, I'd never stop screaming at him.  It's his choice in the end, though.  I wish you luck in talking some sense into him, but if he refuses to listen to reason I'm not sure what you can do.
