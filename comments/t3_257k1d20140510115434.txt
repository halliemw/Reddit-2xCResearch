Nuvaring veteran here, just to check in about that method. 

I have used the Nuvaring for more than four years and prefer it to combination and progestin-only pills. No, I am not paid by Merck. I loooooong for the day that it goes generic. 

A couple of things to note about the Nuvaring: 

* The ring is a vaginal insert made out of plastic, which releases small amounts of oestrogen and progesterone, absorbed through the vaginal walls. 
* Same as with the Pill, you need to make sure you insert and remove the ring at the correct time. This can take the pattern of three weeks in, one week out (Sunday start) or you can use the ring continuously for four weeks at a time and then change it. 
* The ring is easy to insert, and cannot be felt if placed properly. It can be left inside the vagina during intercourse (no effect on contraception), or removed for comfort. 
* **IMPORTANT** : If you remove the ring for sex, be certain that you re-insert it within three hours! Effectiveness starts to go down after that. 
* As with all hormonal birth control methods, talk to your doctor about antibiotics and other medications. Do not take St. John's Wort, as it can affect effectiveness. 

Downside first, then good things. The Nuvaring costs more than the Pill. It made little difference to me when I lived in the US, because my insurance didn't cover contraception (or ante-natal care, or pap smears). I chose to pay a little more because of the good things below. 

I prefer the Nuvaring because I was always stressed about taking my pill on time. I carried mine with me everywhere, but it was difficult to always be on top of it. This way, I build my Nuva into my Google Calendar and get alerts on my phone twice a month. 

In addition, I suffer from anxiety and depression which can be made worse by hormonal shit. At times, the Pill wasn't great for me in that regard (Increasing amounts of oestrogen each week? LET'S CRY ON EVERYONE!). My doctor who first prescribed me the Nuva said that the low, local to my lady-parts dose of hormones in the ring might help with that. It might be placebo, but I notice a difference. 

Added bonus: my "period" (withdrawal bleed) is shorter than ever. Three days tops, when I choose to have one. Almost no cramps. No breast tenderness (a major issue before). 

**Ask me if you have questions about the ring. Happy to help!**\
