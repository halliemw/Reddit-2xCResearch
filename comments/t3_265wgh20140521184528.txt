How recent? 

I'd imagine the woman, the professor of the class, the department head and student affairs/the provost/whoever you deem the appropriate representative of the university itself would want to hear about it.

I'd provide them with a matter of fact account of the story and a list of names (who took the photo, and anyone who may have asked for it).

Let them sort it out, but at the very least, the woman deserves to know.
