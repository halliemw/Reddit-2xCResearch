This.  My ex was like this, and it was horrible.  Don't feel guilty for saying "no" to something you don't want to do.  If you want to keep hanging out with him, do it somewhere where you can walk away, and he doesn't have to chance to keep pressuring you.  Stick to your guns, stand up for yourself.  It's hard, but if your "consent" is only obtained by badgering you until you give in just because it's easier than continue to say no, it's not really consent.
