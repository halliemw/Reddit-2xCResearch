it's a mistake *in your opinion*. You fail to realise that not everyone in the community agrees with you... while simultaneously accusing the mods of the same thing. 

I've been subbed to TwoX for two+ years... every week there's a post "DAE think TwoX is going down the pooper?" and ... hey, people still post, it's still a good environment, nothing exploded. I think that more exposure is good. It will draw lots of good people into the community who may not have otherwise found it. There will be many trolls and assholes, but there are many *more* people who will downvote them and defend the target, and mods who will delete truly inappropriate content.
