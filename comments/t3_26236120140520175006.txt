This is a really important distinction, and is consistent with a lot of what I see regarding race in the U.S. I recall some time back there was a study in which psychologists had actors of different races fall down in a crowded, mostly white train station, and there was a significant disparity whereby people in the crowd would consistently help the white actors, but not the ones of color.

I think "favoritism" also relates to "privilege" in an important way, and is a necessary basis on which we need to expand our understanding of discrimination. However, there are ways in which this study seems incomplete, and I would like to see more work done on this.
