I'm really concerned they won't prescribe you the drug that makes insertion easier (I can't for the life of me remember what it's called) *or* pain killers.  What the hell?  Why not?  Both of those are fairly standard for the procedure.  This will not make you feel better, but a friend of mine got it done without the cervix drug and had a seizure.  Since then she loves it though.  Other friends who've had it with that drug did fine.
