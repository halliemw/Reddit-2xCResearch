The problem is that "sluts" is not just a subset of women. The definition of a slut (just like the definition of "too much sex") changes all the time. If you ask my grandma what a slut is, she'll have a different point of view than if you asked my little brother. If you asked a conservative person how much sex is too much, they'll have a different answer than someone who is more liberal. It feels like "slut" means a particular type of woman, but all women are in danger of being put into that category by someone else, just because they don't meet that person's standards. It's a sexist framework. Someone who has not had sex can be called a slut just by wearing a short skirt. So to me the term slut has an inherently sexist history and is used in a sexist way, when in fact the definition is so fluid because there's no such thing as a slut. It's just used to police women into "acceptable" sexual behavior. Why buy into the term in the first place?
