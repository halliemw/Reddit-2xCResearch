Not really, some like it some don't, you'll have to look long and hard for a guy who wants to swallow period blood though. Not all bodily fluids are equally as disgusting and I'm not sure why this is being pushed as some gender issue, plus on a male dominated site you expect guys not to be shocked by some period stuff? :P I mean it's good they get told some of the things that really happen but they're bound to be disgusted by it at least a bit.
