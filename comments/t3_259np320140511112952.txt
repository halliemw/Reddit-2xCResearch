No, I didn't think of the "finishing" possibility.  But that does seem like a miscommunication.  If some guy asked to do it from behind and then I felt him try to go up my butt I would freak a bit but I wouldn't think he was raping me, just that he misunderstood my consent.

>f someone has said "no" you previously you better make sure they have changed their mind and not just assume 

I agree.  They seemed like people who communicated about this, (she asked him to stop, he did).  So I think he assumed she changed her mind because, to me, except for her inner monologue, it seemed like she did.  I mean, she didn't give him consent for him to "finish" on her either.  

I wasn't there and have no idea what really went down, but also she said she stopped because she was bored and she seemed to stop being bored.  She feels how she feels.  I can't judge, but I don't think the guy was being too out of line here.  It is the rest of the dating that he seemed FAR worse.
