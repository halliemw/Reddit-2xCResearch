you drew a clear boundary and he crossed it. he crossed it when you were so intoxicated that you were no longer able to make clear decisions. i cannot answer 100% if it was rape or not. the answer depends on how drunk he was. if i had to guess i would imagine that the most likely scenario is that this was rape. this would be difficult to prosecute in a court of law, and would likely result in him not being found guilty UNLESS you have some type of video of the events that took place that showed that he was not impaired (phones video ability are awesome for 'he said she said' court cases). 

this is one more of those cases that makes me believe that we should be pushing for development of MRI equipment that scans the brain in real time and reads minds. we have crude versions now that can read minds to a very crude degree, but future advances in technology will be able to clear these things up. they will be great for cases like this one. perhaps in the future you will be able to prove conclusively once and for all about this night. and if he did intend to do what he did then hopefully they will lock him away so that he does not do this to other people.
