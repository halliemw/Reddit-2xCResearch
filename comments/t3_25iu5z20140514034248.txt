Everyone makes mistakes! Relax and let it go. Now you know that this kind of thing isn't for you. Be grateful you did it, because this memory will steer you towards what does work for you. 

And, most people feel lonely. Don't worry too much about it. Find a nice hobby, spend your time on it and you'll meet more like minded people. Also you will find that you do not need romance / sex to fill up the hole in your heart.

Everything will work out. Now forget about all this and enjoy your day.
