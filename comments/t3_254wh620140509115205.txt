My point is that they haven't responded. Any time they want to provide  new response (anything more detailed or interesting than "we think this is good, trust us, give it time") that would be great. 

My point is very much that whether this is a good move or not, the way it was handled was shit. And I'd like to see that addressed, before any more requests for trust and patience.
