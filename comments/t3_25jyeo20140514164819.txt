I agree with /u/letsbreakstuff. A self-defence class is worthless and will only give you a false sense of security. Even if you successfully mastered X, Y, Z moves you'd still most likely freeze up in the face of a real attack. People do that.

Pepper spray and/or a gun. Be sure make some Tweets and Facebook statuses about trying your new gun out at the shooting range, maybe your aggressor will back off.

**DO NOT THREATEN HIM DIRECTLY. THAT IS STUPID AND WILL GET YOU ARRESTED. THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM RECOMMENDING.**
