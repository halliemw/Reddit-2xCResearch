If it's the problem with getting a job, just make sure it can be covered I guess... I had a similar conversation with my girlfriend (who has some tattoos)... This may not be the same issue but, I don't like too many tattoos on a girl... And large tattoos that cover an entire section of your body, that can be hit or miss. Don't get me wrong, I think tattoos can be hot as fuck, but there is a limit (My personal opinion). He could just be making up other reasons to avoid telling you this because he is supposed to see you as beautiful no matter what... yes it is your body, but if your married, its both of yours, as is his(May not be true)... Or maybe he is worried about the job thing, I don't know, I'm not a doctor.
