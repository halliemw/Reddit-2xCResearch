There isn't much you can do because there's no logic behind their actions, only a sense of entitlement and the belief that they're always right to the point of blatant hypocrisy. They'll message you, calling you an ugly bitch, but if you respond and call them an ugly douche, they'll say you're a loser with nothing better to do than insult strangers on the internet. They play by their own rules, and you can't even use their own rules against them, because the rules are whatever the fuck they feel at the time
