Sorry, but you can't pick two obnoxiously obscure examples and call the case made when you have many more examples that are exactly just unpopular opinions.  (and nonsense hyperbole)   

GOT's is one of the most popular shows on cable TV right now.  2nd or 3rd highest rated.   Breaking Bad, Soprano's and The Wire *are* all WIDELY regarded as being some of the best TV every made.  From critics and audiences alike.   

No one ANYWHERE that I've ever read here thinks that abortion in any phase is 100% acceptable.  Stupid claim on the face of it.

Yes, the tide is turning on marijuana, gay marriage, fundamentalist religion, and atheism as whipping dog.  Sorry you're upset that those are now popular opinions but I would suggest you get used to it.  People were upset when prohibition ended and alcohol could be consumed again legally and when interracial marriage became socially acceptable too.  

ISP's ARE despicable for many, many reasons and yeah, that's a very popular opinion.  

It's also a very popular opinion outside GOP enclaves that one should be pro-science and there's nothing wrong with that.  If fact, being ANTI-Science is indefensible and utterly ignorant.  

How about you stop whining about meaningless down votes you've received for voicing unpopular opinions.  Maybe you should be spending your time at conservareddit.com.  I'm SURE your opinions would be very popular there.
