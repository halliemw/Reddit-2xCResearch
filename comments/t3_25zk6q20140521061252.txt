In Germany the "Fräulein” (the diminutive Frau title for unmarried women) died of completely somewhere in the eighties. It's nowhere to be found on forms or letters, and actually using it is now considered an insult in most contexts. So it's definitely possible to change these things even if they are deeply ingrained in society, but it needs a concerted push.
