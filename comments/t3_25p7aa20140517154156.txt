 > I don't think you quite got the gist of my point here. Although, it's amusingly clear you spent a decent amount of time proving you do in fact care a bunch. 

No, I understand. I DON'T care if you care about the downvotes or the meaning of it. As far as everything else in the argument, you're absolutely right, I do care a bunch, and I never said otherwise. I thought you were out of line and it bothered me. I don't feel like my time was wasted. I spent a whole 10 minutes reading and responding to you - big deal, I would have wasted that time watching TV or masturbating anyways. 

 > Sorry, your subjective opinion on validity and levels of bluntness is just that. No different than mine and any fantasy you have about being more valid is just another opinion. You know what they say about opinions I'm sure.

Honestly, I would really consider being more tactful in how you respond to people. It's fine if you want to keep your opinion on what is respectful and rude. You're entitled to do that, but why do it if it make you come off as a jerk? You can either expect everyone else learn how to receive your form of "blunt" criticism, or you can just be a cool guy and not use condescending, demeaning, negative words. It's your choice, but you'll get a lot farther by doing the latter.

 > Do go on and have a good weekend anyway. 

You too.
