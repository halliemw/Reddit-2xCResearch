Books I would have to say Annabeth from the Percy Jackson series.
She's very take-charge and smart, she definitely does not let anyone walk all over her, but she's also a very good friend. Not to mention that she can sass with the best of them.

I honestly can't think of one for movies, like, there are plenty to admire, but I'm a whole lot of snark and there is, unfortunately, a lack of female sass masters in movies, I think.
