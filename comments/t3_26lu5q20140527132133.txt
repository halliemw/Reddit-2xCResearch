Maybe for you, the body isn't as important as eating out and having more free time for other things.  That's fine.  Find some other things that make you feel good about yourself and do them instead.  There is definitely a healthy living movement out there in the media, but you need to remember that if it makes you feel bad, that's because it's *exactly what they are intending to do*.  Make you feel bad and visit X site for page views or buy X protein shake or join X gym.  Marketing is designed to make us hate ourselves so we consume things to feel better.  It's actually offensive and if you really look inwards I think you'll find so much of your identity and what you value is rooted in advertising/media telling you what to think and believe about yourself and your place in the world.  Fuck them.  Live your own life and do whatever it takes to love yourself.  Media is all just a bunch of bullshit - intellectual pollution.  

On the other hand, if you really do want to get fit, don't give into the defeated attitude that you'll "always be this way, and never that way".  It's a cliche but you can do anything; sometimes our demons just get in the way.
