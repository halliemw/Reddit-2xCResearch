I get that its super important to be assertive and toot your own horn. But I'm sick of workplaces that are un-emptathetic, cut throat, and individualistic, as if we are here on this earth to compete with each other.  It's depressing and I notice that it affects morale.   It's bullshit - studies SHOW that team work is more effective.  Yet we reward psychopathic behavior.  My mother said she noticed this trend beginning in the 80's - people are less good to each other and I think it's dividing people. But I have no idea how to change it!!  


Being a psychopath is one way to get shit done, but certainly not the only way.  I did PR/marketing in a big corporate company, and and other co workers literally tried to sabotage or one up each other during presentations or in front of the boss.   They would think of ways to trip each other up during presentations, or take credit for someone ease's work and stuff.  One day our boss offered up a new project and I confidently assertively said that I would like to it so he said "good job on being assertive - it's yours!".  Then the guy next to me stood up and slammed his hand on the table and said "NOO I WANT IT!!!".  THe boss smiled wistfully as if he was remembering the 'good old days' or something, and said "It's yours, son!"



 Now I do PR for a women's health centre and I feel much happier.  I never get headaches or panic attacks anymore.   Everyone works together instead of competing with eachother, while still being assertive about their accomplishments.
