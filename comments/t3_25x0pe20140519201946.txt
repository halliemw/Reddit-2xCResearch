Same! I had sex for the first time (at 21) a few months ago but didn't tell my bf. We're still together and he doesn't know he was the first and only (I didn't bleed or anything, and neither did a lot of my friends on their first time.) Virginity is socially constructed anyhow - I didn't feel like "a changed woman" afterwards at all.
