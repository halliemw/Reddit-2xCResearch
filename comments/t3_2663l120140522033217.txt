I don't know if you'd be at all interested in this, but you could make a comic showcasing the after effects of rape/assault. It would not be funny, but it would make a point. You could have a part where the survivor sees/hears a trigger (like, I dunno . . . a comic that graphically depicts rape) and has a PTSD reaction. The few studies that I've read on the topic stress that depicting male and female victims increase male attentiveness to assault lectures drastically. 

But yeah, I totally agree with /u/Then_I_got_rabies. Speak up, you have as much if not more right to say how you feel than he does to bring that stuff into a group where it's not the focus.
