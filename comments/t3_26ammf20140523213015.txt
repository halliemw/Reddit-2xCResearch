No, he needs to be removed from the college.  If he is such a threat that he is sexually assaulting people, he doesn't need to be in a college.  Either he is able to understand it is wrong, and thus should be punished, or he doesn't, and thus should be kept in an institution that has trained people to keep him from harming others.  What if his victim was a woman who froze or broke down?  What if it was a learning disabled girl who didn't have a clue how to stop the assault?  What if it was a child?

Either the individual understands what they did was wrong and thus should be punished or they don't and shouldn't be in the general public.
