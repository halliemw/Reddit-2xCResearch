I've had 1 biopsy and 1 LEEP, luckily my PAP's went back to normal after that was done with the exception of an inconclusive one which was apparently nothing. From what I understand just because you have displasia and follow up abnormal PAP's doesn't necessarily mean cancer progression. Many things can cause the abnormal cells and if left long enough they can *eventually possibly* turn to cancer but it's not a guarantee. As long as you continue to go to your appointments you should be alright because they'll continue to remove abnormal cells if they need to. And just for reference, although yes I only had 1 LEEP, I'm now pregnant and haven't had any fertility issues. They most likely won't do a hysterectomy on your request, it's a major surgery with many possible side effects.
