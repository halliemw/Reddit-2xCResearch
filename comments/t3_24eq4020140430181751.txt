I have never been pregnant, so bear that in mind. But my take is to be informed and then make your own choices. Parents get judged for an absurd amount of stuff, so I kinda see pregnancy as the start of getting comfy with when you take advice, and when you dismiss the "best advice" in favor of what's best for you & your family.
