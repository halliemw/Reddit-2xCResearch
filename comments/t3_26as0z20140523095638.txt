 Talk to him but don't nag him about it.  He will pick it up as it happens.  Maybe he grew up in a house with hardwood floors.  When I talk to my wife about the importance of car maintenance her eyes just glaze over.  When I put an electric tire pump, can of fix-a-flat and a small toolkit in the trunk of her car she rolled her eyes.  She eventually needed it and it saved her a lot of time, but she eventually got it.  Is there stuff he does that you have no clue about?  Like (just an example don't flame me) car maintenance?  Does he mow the lawn or do anything else that you don't?  Because if you ask him to split everything he might start to get ideas.
