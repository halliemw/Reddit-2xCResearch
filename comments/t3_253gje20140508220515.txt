1 in 6 women have been been raped or the victim of an attempted rape. That number is probably higher when you add all the unreported accounts. Add in the number of men who are victims of rape and sexual assault, and you're looking at a pretty large number of people who have been directly affected. By joking about this very real issue, it makes it seem less serious and invalidates people's true experiences.

Street harassment occurs when people think they are entitled to comment on someone's body. They think they're just allowed to make you uncomfortable and scared. Street harassers sexualize bodies in situations that have no sexual context, without the victim's consent. It the objectification of women in action, and it happens everyday.

Porn, especially the growing genre of "gonzo" pornography, are showing more and more violent acts. You don't think that people being exposed to the idea of "this is what sex looks like" when there's hitting, choking, rough penetration, name-calling, rape play, etc. is not affecting sexual violence? The fact that an average gonzo pornstar's career is about three months because her body can't handle any more should say something. I'm not saying all porn is bad, nor am I trying to kink-shame people who like rough sex. But to say that all people are in no way influenced by porn might be a little naive.

Of course false rape accusations are horrible and the accusers should face consequences, but more often than not people will jump through hoops to not call someone a rapist (Woody Allen, Jameis Winston...)
