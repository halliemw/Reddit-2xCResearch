That is great! And so true. A few days ago my mother said something similar to me. That she thought that because this relationship was the only major one in my life that maybe I was attributing a deep love to something that didn't deserve it. (She was clearly right now that this has come to light) And that one day I would find a good person, who loves me completely and it will blow this so far out of the water I will be stunned.  I really hope that is the case.  

Also, I find myself looking at a lot of these motivational banners right now. So this is doubly appropriate!
