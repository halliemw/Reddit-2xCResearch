I'm not sure where you're located, but in major cities (like here in NYC), they have salons with experts that specifically evaluate your eyebrows with regard to your face shape and preferences. They're not always worth the money (the one I found was around $80), but if you do your research, it could be a really good place to start. I started plucking mine in 7th grade and had the WEIRDEST SHAPED EYEBROWS for like 8 years. Going to a brow bar or brow salon would have saved me from my awkward L-shaped eyebrows. It's quite possible that it could help you figure out where to start while also enabling you to bypass the terrible figuring-it-out phase.
