How about just telling him? "Hey, I like you a lot, but I would like to take it slow. I would like to build this relationship with you a bit more"

If you get a frustrated reply and he demands that you give him sex, probably the guy doesn't want a relationship anyway, and you can move on.

I hope you'll get an understanding reply and a follow-up date etc.
