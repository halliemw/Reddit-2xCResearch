Male working in software for 2 years....have finally started working with a female that we hired last week.

There is a serious problem with bad developers out there that either can't code easy problems, or can't talk through problems at a high level. In fact we both interviewed and turned down more women than men in our recent hiring spree, and we interviewed and turned down a lot of men!

Any woman who is a good developer and knows her shit will have 0 problems finding a good job at a place that values them for their brains and not their bodies.

EDIT: Can anyone who has downvoted me please tell me why?  If comments by men are unwelcome here, even when we have a perspective to offer in regards to the topic at hand, perhaps there should be a rule on this.  I think it's clearly relevant according to rule 4.  I'm talking about my experience interviewing people, specifically the anomaly of having interviewed more women than men for our position, and yet I'm downvoted by a good number of people at this point.

EDIT2:  Also, we actually discarded a lot more men than women in phone screens, but since we had more women in the office, we ended up turning down more women than men there.  These were for front-end developer positions.
