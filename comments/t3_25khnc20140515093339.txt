>But the point is, *hiring* discrimination isn't the problem. You can't reasonably expect companies to have a 50/50 split in gender of their engineers if <10% of people graduating from programs in that discipline are women, and I have never seen any data to support the idea that there's an immense amount of gender discrimination in hiring for engineering jobs.

You're constructing a strawman.  Hiring discrimination to women in STEM fields,  even if there are additional obstacles to women that discourage them from entering the field at all.  And the research indicates there is hiring discrimination.  [See here](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/study-women-who-can-do-math-still-dont-get-hired/)
