I understand what you mean. It's a situation you've never been in. I worked at a cemetery for a summer doing landscaping. My crew was half summer students and half full timers. The full timers were all adult men and made lots of inappropriate comments to the female students. The manager did a "sensitivity" talk but it didn't do much. I loved the work and I mostly worked alone, so it wasn't a terrible situation. This is one very specific situation and there are a lot of guys below saying how they treat everyone with respect, which is awesome. I don't think it's awesome that you've been downvoted like your feelings aren't valid.
