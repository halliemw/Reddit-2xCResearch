I was raped and for years blamed myself for being in their room. It all happened so fast and I kept yelling no but I couldn't fight both of them off. These were my closest friends too and due to unsafe home situation at the time I was staying at their place for safety. I'd been doing this for months and it had been wonderful before. I just couldn't believe what happened and didn't admit it to myself for years. However I felt so sick and sad no matter how hard I tried to repress it I couldn't and never went back. Years later one of them apologised for raping me and I can't pretend it didn't happen anymore. 

I shared this story with Reddit once before and received messages saying I just regretted having drunken sex and was just trying to ruin someone's life and needed to take responsibility for my own choices along with some nasty comments about my character. For the record I did none of that and even if I was passed out drink it wouldn't change a thing. Rape culture is real and alive in those drum beaters who complain about false accusations. Stop telling victims we were asking for it.
