How much information do you have about HPV and high-risk HPV?  If you haven't, it's probably time to do some serious reading.

Because your doctor asked you to come back in a year (and not, say, within a few months) is a very good sign that there hasn't been much change in your cervical cells--just enough to be noticed.  Cervical cancer from HPV takes a very, very long time to develop (like years long) so just keep seeing your doctor regularly and you should be fine.
