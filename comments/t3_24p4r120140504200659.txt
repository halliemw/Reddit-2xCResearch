I also have PCOS and one thing my doctor told me to do was to eat like I was diabetic and cut out sugar and carbs from my diet. Oh, how I wish I'd listened to her years ago... anyway, [r/keto](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/) and [r/xxketo](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo) could probably be very helpful to your goals.
