I don't understand how these parents can be so outraged at the thought of their daughter's being "commodified" and in the same sentence talk about NFL players as if they aren't human beings also.

Even when an athlete is drafted, they don't **have** to play for the team that chooses them. Sure there's a large money incentive that could lose if they choose not to, but they aren't being forced against their will.

Is someone going to force a "drafted" girl to go the prom with whatever boy "drafts" her? They also have nothing to lose if they choose to say no.
