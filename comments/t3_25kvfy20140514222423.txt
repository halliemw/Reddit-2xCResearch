I would love to do this. It would give me an excuse to do more reading, I seem to have lagged off lately. I would like to add that it would be nice to keep the books at an easier reading level (something easier to digest and keep up with a book club).

I also agree with the poster who said this may be a good thing to form a subreddit for. I would love a TwoX book club specifically.
