Keep posting and commenting, I've been doing the same! This stuff is what twoX is all about; there a lot of new members who are saying how happy they are that they can now feel safe sharing their experiences. The best way to show them that despite the shit that's going down is to keep doing what we always do!

Check out "Who is Pulling Your Strings." It's a book on manipulation and it talks a lot about how to strengthen and harden yourself and how to stand up for yourself when you want to say "no." It's okay to not be a people pleaser! You aren't responsible for other people's happiness, only your own!
