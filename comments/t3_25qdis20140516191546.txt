Honestly, not in general, no. If you have some special condition that makes your period completely unbearable, like PMDD, that's something that's on you to sort out with an employer, not something that every single woman should be granted the accommodations for, because not every woman has or I think even most women have life-disrupting menstruation. I know this kind of paid leave would be totally wasted on me, since periods pass by barely noticed on my end.
