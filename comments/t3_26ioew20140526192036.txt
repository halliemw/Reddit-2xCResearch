I disagree quite a bit. It depends. No one ever asked me what my GPA is ever, not one time. People only want to know if you graduate. There are exceptions.

I got a very low GPA due to having fun, and it never stopped anything, job-wise.

Why not have fun and develop friendships that last a lifetime, rather than have a horrible university experience by always studying? The shit I did, that never presented itself since.
