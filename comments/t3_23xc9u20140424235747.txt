I find that in general, people get more offended if you refuse things, than if you just eat a little of things. Surely you can fit a small amount of dessert into your diet, right? You won't balloon up by having half a slice of cake every few months when you visit your family, and I think it's worth it if it brings social peace. 

As for their concern about your portion sizes, I'd probably go with a white lie and tell them you just had a really huge breakfast/lunch (depending on what meal this is). Talk about how you just ate a *ton*, so you're really not very hungry yet, you could only possibly eat this much. That sort of thing. Usually that works.

If it wouldn't offend them, it might also work to just explain to them that now that you're much smaller, your appetite is just smaller as well? If there's a clear visual difference, that might work. I had to have that talk with some people when I was thinner, because I'm very short as well, and didn't need to eat that much. When I pointed out to people that I was half a foot (or more) shorter than them, let alone half their weight, it made sense why I was eating "so little". But on the other hand, if they're at all sensitive about their weights (or about their size difference with you), that might just sound like you're accusing them of being fat gluttons. So, you know, approach with caution.
