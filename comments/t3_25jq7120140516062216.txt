This debate has brought to my attention an important point (see other threads I've been involved in).  There are in fact 2 distinct kinds of feminism.

**True feminism** is about addressing inequal application of (universal) rights to women.

**Female superiority feminism** is about giving *different* rights to women.

IMHO, The former is not just acceptable, it is fundamental goal of a fair and just society.  The latter is just as outrageous as male superiority.

The real problem is that FSF tends to be considerably more vocal than TF, and as such, many TFs, when they call themselves "feminists" are tarred with the same brush.  As a consequence, many TFs incorrectly find themselves being labelled "man-haters," when the reality is that is true only of FSFs.
