Interestingly enough, 2X has always been related to feminism, as it is related and relevant to womens' lives, but it has never been *about* feminism.  I read a comment on some sub yesterday, something to the effect that it is a good thing that were going default cause that will make all the crazies go away and only the true feminists (the egalitarian ones) will stay or everybody would stay and reddit will finally know for sure that we're all a subgroup of SRS.

I mean, WTF??????????  Maybe they are sending these PMs to filter which of us is which and figure us out?  Lol.  Complain about my dick ------>  crazy, can go away.  Accept to be put into her place  -------> good feminist, can stay... I shudder to think how things are going to be here for a while.
