Thanks for this--it helped me realize that I *do* do well when the social activity is structured (e.g. giving a speech), but maybe not so well outside of that. I'd always felt like I'd grown leaps and bounds because I could do so well in that part of my career, but I obviously have further to go. You guys are giving me hope!
