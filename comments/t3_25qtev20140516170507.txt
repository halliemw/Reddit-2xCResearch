Sweetie, you need to breathe. You're giving yourself anxiety attacks, that is no good at all, nor is it conducive to your mental health. Chances are high that you're pregnant... Based off of what you told us Redditors. Now, I'm not sure what you can do about it-- if it's too late for Plan B and you're afraid to have an abortion due to past mental trauma from losing a child *which is completely understandable* then that leaves you two choices in my opinion.

1) Keep the baby IF you are pregnant, despite your uncertainty about that.

2) Go through an abortion... Despite the mental anguish you might feel. :(

I'm not really sure what to say, other than calm down and talk to someone you trust. That's your best bet. Along with finding out for sure if you're actually pregnant. My prayers and thoughts are with you.
