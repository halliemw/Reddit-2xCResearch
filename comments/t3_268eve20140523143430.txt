Even if her partner knew that the meds were interfering with her normal judgment, how does that mean he fucked up?
I've had my partner come home from a night out, very drunk and horny as hell. I knew they were not sober, but if I'm in the mood for sex, why would I turn them down? Just because there's a slight chance that when they're nursing a hangover the next day they might wish they hadn't? Sorry, life's too short to live with that kind of anxiety. Besides, even though other commenters seem to insist that consent only exists if both people scream "I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU," intelligent people know that there are a million forms that consent can take. Everything from "that look" your partner has given you a million times before to simply moaning softly when that caress you gave them turned them on. Bottom line for me (but clearly not for the OP) is that nothing happened that night that hadn't happened many times in the past and there's no reason to think that (because the OP can't honestly recall) that she wasn't completely into it at the time. It's too bad she feels uncomfortable about it all now, but IMHO, that's more about an internal struggle she's facing than anything based on a reality, with facts. I genuinely don't believe I'm victim-blaming here because I'm unconvinced there is either a victim or a perp in this case.
