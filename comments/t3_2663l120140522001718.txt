Not necessarily.

Porn is fantasy, and there are lots of people with politically incorrect fetishes.  Does bondage porn glorify kidnapping and torture?  There are even women with a rape fantasy fetish.  I don't think it glorifies rape, but if it's making people seriously uncomfortable, then he should be instructed to stop bringing this material to meetings.
