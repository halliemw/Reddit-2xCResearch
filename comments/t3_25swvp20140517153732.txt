So by that same logic, someone who keeps themselves well dressed, groomed, fit, and generally looking attractive should be perceived as someone worth respecting, not someone to be groped and objectified against their will like OP has been.

There's a difference between making a character judgement, and deciding someone doesn't deserve basic human respect.
