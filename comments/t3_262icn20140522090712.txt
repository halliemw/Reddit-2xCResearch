This is false, there are countless reasons somebody would take an internship for a politician who's party side they were not on.  There is a lot of work to be done in a number of fields an intern could need experience in and it doesn't mean they have to beat the drum for their employer.  Not to mention often these types of jobs you simply  apply to a pool and get assigned to who you work for, you often don't apply to a specific judge/politician/etc.
