I'm TERRIFIED of weed whackers because I got hit in the leg with a piece of glass that flew out from one as a kid. Just the noise of them makes me freak out. I hate it when the dudes come and mow/whack at my apartment complex. I refuse to go outside if I can hear/see the lawn mower or weed whacker :(
