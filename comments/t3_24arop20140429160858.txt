Hmm they were probably already accepting of a certain amount of risk, since they were having sex anyways (presumably). Re: child choice, they may have planned on doing IVF (as said in the first paragraph of the article) or adopting, but when they found out they could have a child, they decided to do it the old-fashioned way.

Assuming the parents were soliciting questions to share their experiences, I might ask: 

* what kind of questions did you have for your doctor when you found out the old fashioned way way possible?

* What kind of monitoring did you have to go through during your TTC period? Weekly check-ups on viral load?

* Does being HIV+ still impact life expectancy? Do you face judgement for bringing a child into the world while one of you lives with a potentially life-threatening disease.

* Had you always been planning on having a child.

* How did it feel to have sex w/o a condom for a change ;)

If you are wondering about children vs childfree, you should start a new thread about that - or do a google search for a previous thread. (To easily search reddit, type into google [site:reddit.com/r/twoxchromosomes search terms]). That's something probably quite different than this topic :)
