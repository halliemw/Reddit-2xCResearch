No, your advantage as a man is that when you refuse someone their hostility is almost meaningless. While as a woman hostility to a no is backed up by the power to the beat the shit out of you. Remember that women live in a world where everyone is on average taller, and stronger than them. The only reason women don't get grabbed on the street and done with at the will of the individual men is because the men choose not to do so. But they *could.* Fuck, they still do - look at the nigerian schoolgirls who were kidnapped. And I am glad for civilization and police force and the recognition of my bodily integrity as a right because if those were gone so would my ability to say no. And those lovely facts are always in the back of my mind.

By far most exchanges that happen to me happened on the street, when I was busy. Even there some men felt entitled to approach me and entitled to at the very least an apologetic no. And as a woman you feel it's like a shit lottery. So you DO go out of your way to make sure you don't piss off the wrong guy who might be violent. And No matter what I say, I get a range from disgusting slurs, attempts to touch me, refusal of no and repetition of advance and outright violence. 

Of course this does not excuse women being rude on purpose like in your examples. But do realize there is more to it than what it seems.
