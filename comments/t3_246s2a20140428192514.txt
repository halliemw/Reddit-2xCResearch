I completely understand the limits of self defense training.  I myself have found myself frozen in situations I would have expected anger.  I don't see such training as a magic wand in any way, but I think in some situations it can lend a level of confidence that may be a deterrent.  I guess I see it like a seatbelt.  Hey, in a bad wreck, it very possibly won't do you any good, but, in certain circumstances it very well might save your life.  Bad analogy, but I can't think of a better one.  I don't think someone who freezes and blanks on everything they know has failed in any way, but I think they have a better CHANCE of reacting in a possibly useful way if they have some sort of training.

My comment about "taking it like a good girl" was very heavy sarcasm.  The original commenter was vehemently arguing that self defense was a terrible idea, and that girls should just allow a rape to happen so that they can survive...that teaching girls to fight back is an awful thing.

Hope that makes a little more sense!
