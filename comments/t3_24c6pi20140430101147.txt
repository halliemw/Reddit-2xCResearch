First off, I'm sorry you're in this situation. I hope you've changed doctors because your current one sounds like a hack.

Secondly, I don't know if you've considered going through with the pregnancy and giving the child up for adoption, or if that would also interfere with your education and career, but it may be a good compromise. 

It may also be wise to go somewhere else for the abortion, if you're seriously concerned about being bombed. I don't mean back-alley, just another town.

This is your decision and your body. I'm sorry that you've had to go through this twice.
