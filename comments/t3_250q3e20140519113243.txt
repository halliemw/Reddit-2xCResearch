I'm a woman too! Yay women! 
And I feel it's my duty as an enlightened woman who is aware enough to defend herself against said pressure to help and defend women who have not yet had similar realizations.
You can't be a feminist in a dark room alone, ya gotta spread it! I try to help other women, rather than blame them for not having yet found their inner-feminist! 

Yay ladies/chicas/women
