Well, the blame comes out in little dribbles.  First, they'll invite her to learn more about their religion by attending Sunday School or something like that.  They'll question her own religious beliefs and start to find the inroads into her mind.  The people who run these churches are very experienced at converting people, far more than outsiders realize.

I would never send an already beleaguered family member right into the heart of a cult-like religion.  

I do know one woman who joined a *different* (very liberal) church so that she could get her husband to quit hounding her (that worked short term, in the end she gave in and let the kids go to church with him, and that was the beginning of her own slide into the cult-like church; she had every intention of only pretending to be so involved, but in fact, she drew away from all her friends and no one I know now knows what has happened to her or her family).

Sadly, in the case of my friend, their oldest child needed some fairly complicated medical procedures to be healthy, and the church believed in faith healing (and in donating any extra money that could have been spent on the kids to the church).
