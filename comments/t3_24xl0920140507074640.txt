**If you are too late for Plan B, a copper IUD (paraguard) can be inserted up to 5 days after sex and used as emergency contraception.** You can use the IUD and Plan B at the same time, and once the pregnancy scare has passed, you can choose to leave the IUD in there if you want, for added protection against pregnancy (or you can get it taken out after you know you are not going to get pregnant, totally up to you)

As for your partner. Its your relationship. But he crossed a very serious line, I consider what he did to be a form of rape. He directly disobeyed you and violated your trust. You know him better then I do, But don't sugar coat what he did when you are trying to make your mind up about him.
