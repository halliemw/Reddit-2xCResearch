The letter seems a little weird without a follow up appointment but the general course is to get another PAP, maybe 2 or 3, usually every 6 months then getting a biopsy/colposcopy and then possibly a LEEP. Of course this is all dependent on the grade of your displasia, which is determined after the biopsy. Even with high grade displasia the LEEP procedure can remove all the abnormal cells and there's a good chance they won't return. Of course regularly getting a PAP will keep an eye on that. Ask all the questions you can when you see the doctor but remember, just because you have HPV doesn't mean you will get cancer, it's a precursor and with the screening processes now it's very easy to catch early enough that it isn't a problem. Also remember that HPV isn't necessarily sexually transmitted, it can be transferred as easily as someone not washing their hands after touching themselves then touching you. There's a very high rate of HPV and there's even a chance your boyfriend (or anyone else) gave it to you, men don't generally get any symptoms.
