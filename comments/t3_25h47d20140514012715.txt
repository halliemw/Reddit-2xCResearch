And you don't need to change what you're doing - you can say, "I'm not interested" and they can project onto that and be hurt and lash out.  It's their problem, definitely not yours.

You *could* try to change it up.  If there's a way to let people down with class, they could thank you for it.

But if they're really pushy and obnoxious themselves, if they're going to insult you, perhaps there's nothing you can do.  I don't know who you're getting hit on by, it's probably a power trip each time they try, you shouldn't feel like you need to accommodate them, but there *may*, just *maybe*, be a way to practice your charisma in these situations.

"You flatter me, but no thanks right now."

"Thank you, but I'm not in the market."

Hell, I'm not charismatic, I don't know what to recommend.  And anything entertaining or classy could invite another try.  But I thought I'd put the idea out there.

Navigating social interaction with grace and effect without lying is a real skill!
