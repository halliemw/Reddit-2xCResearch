I'm not a mod.  I don't want to read these terrible things and have to report them over and over in the hopes that this sub will go back to normal.  It is unfair for you guys to put the quality of this sub on us.

I want to come to a nice lighthearted and safe place to read stories and opinions from a female perspective.  It is too much energy for me to read through the BS to get to the good stuff and report or argue with others.
