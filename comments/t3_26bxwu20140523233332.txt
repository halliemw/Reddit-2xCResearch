This sort of thing is why I sort of dread the beginning of summer. I hate that moment after I put on a cute outfit and then stop and look at myself in the mirror and actively think - "do I look too cute in this? Is this slightly too much leg or cleavage? I hate getting catcalled..."
I know it's a silly thought because with time I've grown to realize that catcalling is not about what I'm wearing or how cute I am. But I still always wonder when I put shorts on in the morning - am I going to get catcalled in these? Should I avoid quieter streets today or make sure I only go out with somebody else?

Your experience sounds awful. I can completely understand why you would feel so vulnerable to the point of sobbing. It's terrifying to have to be in a situation where you know that if the other person decided to attack you, you would be powerless to stop them. Be proud of yourself for thinking quickly and running out of the situation.
