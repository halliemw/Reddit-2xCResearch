My cousin's wife donates milk to a local family where the mother can't breast feed for whatever reason. There's also [this](http://www.post-gazette.com/region/2012/11/18/Breast-milk-donations-a-gift-of-life-to-preemies/stories/201211180270) story of a woman near Pittsburgh who donated an awful lot of milk after her baby died. I believe La Leche League also has some sort of donor system, though I could be wrong. That might even be how my cousin's wife found the family she's donating to. 

I think this is an excellent alternative that should be available to any mothers who can't breast feed or who choose not to for whatever reasons. It's healthier than formula, and it might help reduce the guilt that many women feel when they're unable to breast feed. It could also be a big help to poor women who can't breast feed, because while WIC covers formula, donated milk could allow them to use that money to keep them and any older children healthier. If/when I have biological children and hopefully breast feed, I'd absolutely donate if I was producing enough milk.
