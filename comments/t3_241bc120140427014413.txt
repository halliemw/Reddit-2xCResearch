Interesting what he said about the wedding ring.  I found really conflicting views online about whether or not to wear mine.  Some places said it doesn't matter, and might be good (shows commitment), others say what you mentioned.  I ended up just wearing the wedding band and not my engagement ring (which, I admit, is a bit blingy), because I also read about people thinking some women didn't "need" the job because they had a nice ring.
