As a female I would say it really isn't as bad as it probably sounds. 
Don't put too many expectations on your daughter or treat her as some kind of alien cuz she is female.
When I was growing up my dad just treated me like his little pal. Instead of dolls or tea parties, I grew up playing video games, playing with dinosaurs, and doing outdoorsy stuff with dad. I developed self respect from knowing my parents loved me and finding things I was good at other than being pretty. Just relax and enjoy your relationship with your kiddo. If you treat her well, she will learn not to take shit from other guys when she's older.
