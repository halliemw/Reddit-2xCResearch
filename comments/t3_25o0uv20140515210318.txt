I know it works out for some people but I think it's better not to rush it even if you are 'sure'. What is the rush? Unless you really want to have sex and then I don't think that is the right reason to be marrying, it's actually a really fucking terrible reason. 

Also the younger you are the more likely your marriage is to fail, keep that in mind. 99% of 20 year olds don't know shit about life and relationships. That's not a criticism, but just the way it is for everyone. 

Have you discussed money, children, how you want to raise a child if you want them, religion, long term plans with career and location, how you want to run a household, how to deal with family, conflict resolution, how to deal with sickness, unemployment or other stressors, expectations around sex, and so on?

I knew I wanted to be with my fiance for life earlier than six months however we will have been together four years by the time we get married next year. If I was right about him then there would have been no harm in waiting, if I was not right and was being irrational then again there is no harm in waiting and we would not have lasted. If we rushed getting married and made a mistake then there is the trauma of divorce to deal with. The longer I am with him the more sure I become so I do not regret waiting :). 

If you go ahead with this at least get premarital counselling.
