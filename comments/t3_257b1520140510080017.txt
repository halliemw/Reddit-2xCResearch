I have noticed a higher number of people coming in her to complain and an increase in the number of times people are being accused of being sexist. Now, that is not to say women cannot internalize and express sexist statements, I have found myself doing it, but I never noticed it as a significant issue before. Can people who aren't interested unsubscribe or will it still show up on their front page? I don't go into male subs and grouch about what they are saying.
