Maybe I'm less sensitive because I work for big cooperations and see them laid people off once a year. I have been laid off before too. People who have served 15 years given a days notice like you. But you have this sense of entitlement and I'm just trying to open your eyes that they don't owe you anything. Be happy with the severance, file for unemployment, and stop "working" for them after they already laid you off.
