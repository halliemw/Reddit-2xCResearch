Yeah, I fully agree with you. In fact, I do get back to teamwork even when I work from home, but this time I can find partners to work with online who are the exact opposite of certain psychopaths that are mixed into the office, a space where you don't get a say if you want to work with them. (I'm hearing horrible stories from a girlfriend who happens to be a superb programmer. The shit she's getting from some male colleagues blows my mind, and made her cry several times in the office.)
