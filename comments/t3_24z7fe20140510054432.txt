That's the question - before this little debacle I would have said the former, but with the mods' unilateral decision to take it public without consulting the community for even a second, I'd say that they've pretty emphatically made the decision that it should be the latter. :-/

I'm cautiously hopeful that it can have some benefit to reddit as a whole, but I would never havevolunteered us for it, and I still think it was a stunningly and offensively presumptuous decision by the mods to just make the decision for the whole community like that.
