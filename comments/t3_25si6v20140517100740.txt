Sometimes, I just don't care about what a man says, no matter how correct or insightful his words are. My world is so so full of men. Its like, I love my super awesome, sensitive, feminist husband, but sometimes I just want a night with my female friends, no husbands around. TwoX was the place online where I could take a break. There are a lot of really great guys out there, but I don't want to be around them all the time, and I don't want to have to see them and hear all about them on TwoX.
