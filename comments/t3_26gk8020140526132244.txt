I agree whole heartedly with you. There is a lot of info I don't have: not enough context to satisfy many of my questions. I would not want to spread paranoia in the least.  My mom was convinced everyone was an axe murderer. But I've learned to always be wary and watching, no matter how comfortable I may feel. I guess I approach this as a teacher of many 14 year old girls who are easily in over their heads all the time given the area they are living in. Their sad stories makes me want to teach every girl to watch their back at all times. Not to stop themselves but says be prepared.
