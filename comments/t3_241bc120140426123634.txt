At the end of college,  one of my extremely rational and respected professors sat us down (me and the 5 other girls that were graduating with engineering degrees that semester)  and he broke a lot of cruel truth to us. You are going to be discriminated against when looking for a job.

He gave us advice such as how to answer these types of questions, and to be prepared for shit like this during interviews. He suggested not wearing your wedding ring - a young, recently married or engaged woman is most likely to require maternity leave. He explained that he spoke from experience, and that it is just a cruel world out there. I wish i could remember some of the tips he gave - clever ways of dodging questions or turning the question around so that the interviewer ends up talking about themselves (something people Love to do!)  If you do it right, you avoid the question, distract him from asking it again, and pet his ego at the same time. I'm sure you can Google that sorta stuff.


It's shitty that this dynamic exists at all though.
