I am so tired of breastfeeding in public (and how to feed a baby in general) being a debate. Breastfeeding is natural and the biological norm. It's not sexual, it's not equivalent to taking a piss or pooping, breastmilk is not a biohazard, you can see less breast when feeding than you can in a v-neck sweater. Having to feed a baby in the toilet, especially a public one, is gross and unnacceptable.
