My parents are extremely controlling, and one thing that made moving out/disobeying my parents really difficult for me was how poorly my father treated my mother. I've been to therapy since, and the most important thing I've learned is that my mother is her own person. I can't stand up for her or protect her forever - even if I never move away from home, my  dad will still find a way to hurt her emotionally. It sounds to me like your dad is using your "disobedience" as an excuse to lash out at your family, when, in reality, he would probably be doing it anyways. People with that kind of anger can always find an excuse to act on it.

If you can afford it, I'd highly recommend therapy to you once you move out. If nothing else, it might help you to define the familial boundaries you want in your life.

And good luck! :)
