Yeah, I work at a school too and have seen two cases of staff fraternizing with students. The one I know about in detail happened when a female teacher was at her wit's end from job stress and personal problems and was crying at her desk after classes were done for the day. A male student happened to walk by the room, see what was happening, walk in, and kiss her on the lips. Reportedly she just went with it. Later, after she was caught and fired, she told me she never thought she'd do anything like that.  

If anything, that experience taught me that thinking you're a moral person with good boundaries isn't nearly enough. You have to mentally put yourself in the situation of being at rock bottom with nobody to help you, feeling as shitty and lonely and fallen apart as you have ever been, multiply that feeling times five, and then mentally simulate turning away explicit, ardent advances from nice looking, legally aged, seemingly emotionally mature people with top-of-the-scale social skills for the sole reason that they are enrolled in your school and you are responsible for creating a safe environment for them.

I have never met anyone who made a conscious decision to be the bad guy. They've all said some variant of, "it just happened." I guess what I'm saying is that many people wander through life not knowing where their own limits are, but only a small subset of them are subjected to tests where they fail so publicly and so shamefully.
