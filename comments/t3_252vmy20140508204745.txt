No, I won't. 

Why is a mans earning potential relevant to bearing children? Why isn't a woman's? Beyond carrying and giving birth to a child, her income still contributes to a family. We're past the days where single-income households are the norm. 

Heck, what if the couple doesn't want kids? Is his earning potential still relevant? Is hers? Who gives up the job, then?
