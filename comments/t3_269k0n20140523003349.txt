What bullying laws? I didn't advocate for any of that in my comment. I said bullying needs to be shut down. More specifically it needs to be shut down by the private website providers, online games, and internet communities. A great example is this community. If someone starts calling you a bad name and cussing you out, they get banned. It's no affront to their freedom of speech. They are told clearly in the sidebar that it's unacceptable to attack other members. We do not need to put up with their bullshit because of their right to free speech. Private companies and communities have no obligation to give them a platform to spout whatever they want and they can discriminate as they see fit. 

This is the core of that XKCD comic. It does a good job of arguing that same point in fewer words. 

Also you have no idea what action I take outside of this internet community towards reducing suicide. I actually have dedicated my life's work to helping those in crisis. But that's besides the point. Number one focus of this discussion isn't what I do to stop suicide, it's about whether companies are obligated to host bullying to protect the freedom of speech of the bullies. Hint: they're not. 

Reddit shuts bullying down. Their number 1 rule is no doxxing, no exceptions. They aren't trampling over someone's free speech rights to use their private service to call a witch hunt against someone. They're a private company and can refuse service to someone who they believe is abusing their platform and hurting the rights of privacy and freedom from harassment of their members. This is just one of many examples of companies shutting down bullying.
