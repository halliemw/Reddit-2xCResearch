I went to the police. They said that until she tries something I'm SOL. The officer told me to keep my phone on me at all times, and to be safe. 

He didn't delete anything, and even if he had, there's no way to misread it that makes me look guilty of anything.  

My theory is that she blames me for his interest. Like its my fault. I seriously want nothing to do with him.
