This is probably the case. The employer probably knows she is a shitty employee but does not want to get into legal hot water. Assuming OP in the United States, having children is 100% voluntary. It is NOT a disability (I do not believe it is even covered by the ADA)- it is a choice and that being the case, I think the privilege extended in these situations is unfair and undeserved. 

Regardless, it is what it is. OP can't change the situation and complaining can only backfire. Bad habits die hard though and if she is like this now then after she has her baby she will STILL be a lazy employee and ripe for firing.
