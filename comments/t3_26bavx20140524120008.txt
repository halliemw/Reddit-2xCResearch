You can give whatever semi-logical argument you'd like about fairness and about justice.

What I'm telling you, and what you steadfastly refuse to acknowledge, is that you are unequivocally, absolutely wrong about this.  There's no way around it.  And if you bothered to educate yourself for even a moment on the subject, you'd know why.

You've wrapped yourself in an ignorant little bubble and are literally unable to see an outside perspective.  I've already acknowledged that I get your point on an objective level, but that in reality, it's not a viable option.

Educate yourself so you can stop being so ignorant on this subject.
