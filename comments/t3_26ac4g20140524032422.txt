OOf. I can't believe someone that works with data wouldn't account for something like average number of hours worked when looking at pay gap. But, there are plenty of studies that do. The research on gender wage gaps is HUGE - there's a study controlling for almost every factor you can think of. And yeah, the gender wage gap still exists when factors are controlled for.

Here's one by Lowen, A., & Sicilian, P. (2009) "Family-Friendly" Fringe Benefits and the Gender Wage Gap. They control for: previous experience, tenure, # of kids, kids under 6, race, hispanic ethnicity, marital status, partner employment, health status, urban residence, living in the South, company size, education, unemployment rate in the community, nonprofit status, government agency, union status, part time or full time, supervisor status, gender of supervisor, and proportion of females in the occupation. Women's wages are still 75.8% of men's wages. (and btw, receipt of family friendly benefits doesn't moderate the wage gap either).
