As a college-aged female with an un-swiped v-card, I understand the leper part. My friends feel like they have to over-explain basic jokes where the punchline involves anything remotely sexual. My ex-bff decided that her mission last year was to help me sleep with ANYONE before I turned 21 (even though I didn't want anything other than for time run its course). Some say it's a great thing, something I should be proud of. Others think I'm some freak that's missing out on life.

For a while, I also thought something was wrong with me. Am I too weird? Too ugly? Too fat? Do I need to pluck my eyebrows more? WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? I started lying about my innocence, but eventually got caught in the lies (so I respect you for carrying on, it's really hard!). Eventually, I stopped caring about all of that, sexually related self-consciousness or otherwise, and my self-confidence skyrocketed. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself that.
