Remind them that their family loves them and will hug them whenever they feel like they need a hug. Also no one will be sad if you don't feel like hugging them. Asking girls to set aside their discomfort because someone else's good feelings depends on them doing the uncomfortable thing... We learn from a very young age that other people's desires are important, but not necessarily that your own desires, preferences, and hesitations are equally as important.

Teaching children they have to withstand uncomfortable physical contact in order to please someone else is pretty shitty in my opinion.

Saying things like "everyone loves your hugs and if you want to give some out you should do it soon because we're leaving shortly", that sort of thing, is less demanding and makes it more about happy experiences than pressure to please.
