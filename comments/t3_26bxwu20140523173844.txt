There is nothing for you to be ashamed of. THEY are the ones that should be ashamed. After going through that, anyone would have cried. Just because some people have it worse doesn't mean that you don't have reason to cry. 

What you went through is scary. You are allowed to feel however you feel you need to feel. 

\*virtual hugs if you want them*
