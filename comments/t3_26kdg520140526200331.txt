> the nice thing about the dads of young teenagers is that they're often so awkward about the whole puberty thing that they'll say yes to anything so that they can stop thinking about it.

Confirmed. Older brother might not be a bad idea but people are different. I ran 5 miles too the drug store and bought every type of tampon they had when my sister got her first period and my mom was at work, but then again I'm a wonderful person.

Once again, don't mind me I don't even know why I'm even here.
