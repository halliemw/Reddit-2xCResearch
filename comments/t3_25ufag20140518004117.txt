I don't shave my ladybits. I hate that for some reason this makes  some people think I'm not clean. I keep my shit tidy and well-maintenanced, but I *like* having hair down there. I remember when I was going through puberty and was SO excited when I started getting pubes. And then a couple years later as a teen I'm shaving it off, because now it's popular to have a "porn star" vagina. And it was such a hassle, too, especially if you got razor burn/bumps. Ugh!

Glad I don't give into that anymore.
