Sailor Moon fucking rocks. She's a demon ass-kicking, planet saving, totally awesome alien princess who can still relate to the average girl struggling with growing up and school and relationships. 

Most of her storylines emphasized female friendship, and often it was her saving Tuxedo Mask (depends on manga v. Anime though)

The new dub release is apparently not going to censor Uranus and Neptune's relationship too. So it will include positive romantic relationship between girls for younger viewers
