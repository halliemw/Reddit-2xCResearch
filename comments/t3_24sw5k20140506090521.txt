This is such a great response. Thank you, thank you.  You articulating what I am feeling so well. I feel like someone died but I know he was never that person so I'm mourning someone who doesn't exist but still is capable of cutting me so extremely deeply. It is a tall order to try to work on being happy on my own. I know I owe that to myself. But at the same time part of me wants to show him I can move on as fast as he did- obviously not a healthy inclination. I'm pushing back on those urges and I am focusing on trying to heal. I'm definitely in that lonely stage. I have no idea how to do this or even cope with this.
