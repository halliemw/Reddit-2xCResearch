It can definitely be brutal - but for those of us who turn into emotionless, bitchy zombies on any hormonal birth control, it's totally worth it.

I tried almost all the options that claim the least amount of side effects: Several combo pills including low estrogen, mini pill, Nuvaring, patch. I avoided Depo and Implanon.

Seriously, I got a sweet raise at work, and an even bigger bonus this year after going off hormonal birth control.
