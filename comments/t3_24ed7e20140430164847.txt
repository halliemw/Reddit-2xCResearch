I am so sorry you went through this. You shouldn't feel bad for accusing him of anything - he did what you condemned him for. He is a rapist, and you are not to blame. Your body is your own, and you have the right to deny access it at any point. 

I hope that you can find someone to talk to about this, someone you trust. You are safe, you are clean, you are whole. I hope you can throw away the guilt, it should belong to him, not to you. I wish I could give you a hug.
