> I feel like it wasn't consensual sex, and I know that if I told him this he would feel so awful about himself, which I don't want to happen.

You're *supposed* to feel bad when you do something bad, so you know not to do that thing again. Good people can do bad things, and being a good person doesn't absolve them of responsibility when they do bad things. It also doesn't necessarily make them a bad person.... even if they have done a very bad thing. But the bad things are still bad. Okay? All of those things are true. 

I belabor that point, because I had a similar sort of situation happen to me, and a lot of what made it so terrible was that the dude really, honestly, *truly* is not a bad person! He's actually a very good person, he felt *extremely* guilty when he realized that what he'd done was not okay, and he'd never done another thing like it before or since. Plus, you know, best friend. He wasn't and isn't my best friend because he's an asshole, I'm not friends with assholes. 

But that didn't make what he did not bad. It was totally bad. It's hard to reconcile those two thoughts, which was a problem for me, but it's totally true. And then it was easier for me to talk to him about it, because the idea that he'd done something terrible wasn't conflicting with the fact that I still thought he was a really good person and I wanted his support and stuff. 

So, I dunno, my two cents. If I were you, I'd talk to him, because that would be most helpful to me. I'm not saying what you should do, though, because I'm not you! You can do whatever. But I *don't* think you should worry so much about hurting him. He's the one who did something wrong, not you. If he's hurt by this information, it's really by his own hand. If he hadn't had sex with you when you were clearly incoherent, he wouldn't have anything to feel bad about. Essentially, if he becomes upset about this, he brought it upon himself, you don't have any responsibility for that.
