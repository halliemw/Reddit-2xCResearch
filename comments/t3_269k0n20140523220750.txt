> Controlling how other people communicate seems pretty important to you.

Yes, *asking* someone to plainly say what they mean, rather than quoting a COMIC which can come off as "dismissive" or as "talking down" is me controlling the way they communicate.  I didn't say they shouldn't be allowed to do such, if they wish, merely that I don't appreciate it.

I just ranted a whole bunch about my concerns about the potential for censorship and the importance of free speech, so perhaps don't clearly troll? If you're being serious, think about what you're saying first, since my position in all of this has explicitly been that people should be able to communicate whatever they wish, freely.
