Thanks for your comment :) I really do think we have a great friendship which is maybe partly why I'm so afraid of telling her. I know that makes no sense, it's just, I don't want to inconvenience her with this me-moving-out-thing. But yeah, feelings will happen and we will be friends beyond this. 

I wish you good luck with your roommate transition!
