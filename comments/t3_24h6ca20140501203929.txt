On a  pill (Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel), planning to switch to copper IUD when I get the funds.
Reasons are: Side effects on hormonal (Especially dry eyes, urg!), low cost of IUD after time, decreased % of pregnancy with the IUD, and not having to worry about daily use (I'm super regular with the pills but it would be nice to not worry so much). I'm also choosing copper so that I'll have my regular period as I would prefer it to stopping completely (It would be so, so nice but I'd end up worrying that it wasn't working).
