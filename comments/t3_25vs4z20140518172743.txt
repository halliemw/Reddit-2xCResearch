It's a really hard phase to get through but crucial because it will either keep you paralyzed versus starting a new chapter in your life.  I appreciate how you realize that your future doesn't have be ruled by your past.  Sometimes you have to go through a lot of shit to get a beautiful garden. 

Part of my growth and healing was meeting my BF.  At the time I was going through that crappy part of my life I DID NOT want a relationship or ever could see myself in another relationship because of all the painful experiences via one night stands, drinking, the emotional abuse I was getting from my ex and his mentally unstable wife, and even my own parents.  It was like when I was down, people just trampled me down even more...  

So when I met my BF, it was upfront that hey, this is going to be a casual thing... maybe a few weeks. Though I rarely was with an FWB more than three times, our sexual chemistry was... well, outstanding.  He performed above and beyond his usual man bragging. 

Then a couple months later, and we started actually dating, he gave me an ultimatium.. we had to do overnights and spend time together... and SPOON. 

Whut the whut? Overnight? In a bed? All night? SPOONING????

The first morning he asked me jokingly how I did. "I hated it.  You took up more than half the bed, I was on the edge all night where I normally sprawl, you're hot and sweaty... and no. Not fun". 

Now? He goes to bed about 3 hours before I do and I will always spoon with him (sometimes leads to the fun stuff as a bonus) for about an hour... nothing makes me feel as safe and protected than being wrapped by his body.  And we're going on 11 years....
