As a Korean American woman it drives me fucking batshit up a wall and then some when idiots (almost always men and never Asian) assume I'm Japanese and that I can speak Japanese. I've even had the occasional guy on okcupid do a total brainfart and try to talk to me in Japanese to introduce himself. W.T.F. Actually now that I think about it, even weirder is the one guy with a huge obsession with being an egg that was on fetlife/collarme, messaging me while my profile obviously stated I was Dominant/switch - sorry, you are obviously a subscriber to yellow fever but you're messaging a woman that likes to be dominant in bed? Are you serious? Yeah let's put two dominant people in bed, one a raging feminist twinkie (cause I was born and grew up outside of Korea) and the other an egg with a bad case of yellow fever...

No, sorry to fuck with your dream fetish, but I can have a conversation with you in two _other_ East Asian languages as well as English, and trying to patronize me and talk to me in a language I don't know and about customs I don't give a flying fuck about just tells me that you're a creep -_-

edit: not that I think there's anything _wrong_ with yellow fever, but it needs to not actively get in the way of other people. and when you assume all asian woman are japanese, that's problematic :|
