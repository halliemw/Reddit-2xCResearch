i think it's easy to say those things when it hasn't happened to you. but when you're actually being raped by someone, it's just not as simple as fighting them off or chasing them out the room with a bat. rape takes away all of the power and control you have over your own body. it can make you feel absolutely helpless. the author references this when she talks about letting him in because maybe if she just gives him what he wants, he'll go away. it's not about her being stupid or secretly wanting it or whatever. it's about giving up.
