I hope you don't mind me jumping in as a guy, but that man's behaviour was probably criminal had it been videotaped. That is to say, much earlier in that interaction you would have been beyond extremely justified in telling him you didn't like how he was talking to you and wanted him to leave. Seriously if he didn't you could yell for help from co-workers or call the cops. Behaviour like that is dangerous, and outside of a public situation could turn worse. You must never feel bad about reacting appropriately, and the appropriate reaction in the situation you described would be harsh. In a perfectly calm social situation it's fine to care about how you act, but when someone is being threatening please please just do what you have to do to be safe.
