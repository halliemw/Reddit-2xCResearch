Hey, I wish I looked that good. Just sayin'.

 But he must have put out the worst vibe **ever**. I've seen some pretty girls put up with god awful shit from a dude because he "had money". And most of them didn't look as good as this guy. Maybe a good bit taller, but I digress. He had the goods for a superficial relationship if all he wanted was a woman. 

The term "a screw loose" didn't fit this guy. He was running on ONE screw for too long. Even those that suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder tend to procure themselves high paying respected jobs. 

When this is all said and done though. It's going to be one for books. I just hope that's not what his physiologists (yes, multiple) thought. If he hadn't burst like a bubble, I'm sure he would have left a trail of unsolved murders in his wake.
