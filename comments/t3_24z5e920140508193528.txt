No? what about [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-first-cracks-in-the-glass-ceiling-eu-votes-to-impose-legal-quotas-for-women-in-the-boardroom-8952718.html)? is that not "women getting promoted for being women?". 

As far as actually hearing of it directly, well, do you think companies go up to 50 year old white male employees and go like "well, we're promoting you because you're a white male employee, and we want our boardroom to be primarily white, and male"? Companies don't go up to women and go like "hey listen, you're a woman, and there aren't a lot of woman in this industry, so if you quit, it'll be difficult to replace you on that basis, so here's more money". Instead, they'll tell her things like "we want you to move up" and increase her pay while maintaining her responsibilities. Who is going to complain about getting paid more for doing the same thing? 

In any case, I'm not here to argue gender equality in the corporate world. All I said in my last paragraph is that I didn't understand why she felt the need to mention that she is a woman in a male dominated industry. It seems to me like her post would have conveyed the same message whether she mentioned it or not.
