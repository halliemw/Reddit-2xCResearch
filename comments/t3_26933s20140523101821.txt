I work in tech, but not coding.  I am a field tech for major telcom co.  Sexism is alive and well.  It seems utterly ridiculous to me to think someone cannot do a job because they are female, but they do.  I have gotten it from co-workers and customers.  Women are few and far between in the field.  I volunteer w/local schools for non-traditional job events etc.  I want to encourage more young women to pursue tech jobs.  When women are less of a minority in these fields these issues should improve.  My 2 cents.
