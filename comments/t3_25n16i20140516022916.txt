Anything I could write would be contingent on numbers that I don't have, your and mainly her age. The reality is that for you the answer is very very easy, you have to decide honestly if this relationship is worth the obvious risks that it brings in to your life. With her acting the way she does he won't get better so, she has made herself the kind of stereotypical romantic fool that you don't want to have anything to do with. This isn't to say that his actions have anything to do with her but, based on what you wrote "He pulls horrible shit that's just gotten worse over the years." its pretty obvious who he is. If she "can't"/wont move on then you have to start thinking about yourself and the kinds of issues your willing to take on personally. Back to my initial point in your 40's this is unacceptable you should move on immediately she is a lost cause (dead fucking serous about this). 30's is about the same except you might be able to bring her with you. 20's we go back to the 40+ advice, you and her can and should burn this bridge. Of course number one priority is safety, handle this with care and if you need to contact the authorities immediately and find a safe place for yourself. It might hurt but you almost certainly CAN NOT trust her judgement.
