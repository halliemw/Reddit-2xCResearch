Ugh, I'm sorry. That sounds horrible. I fucking hate not being taken seriously by doctors. I don't know why it happens. I've been seeking treatment for an assortment of symptoms for about a year now, and after lots and lots of googling, I finally figured out what I thought the problem was.  

My doctor tried to tell me I was too young, there was no way it was a thyroid issue, we could test for Lymes, blahblahblah. And then, oh wait, my thyroid is enlarged, and hey, the ultrasound shows a nodule and yeah, we should probably biopsy that.  

It sucks, but you really have to be your own advocate. Your pain doesn't sound normal - trust your instincts and keep seeking treatment until you get the answers you need. Good luck, hope you feel better!
