Another 5'1" gal checking in and I completely agree with this! Just the other day I was shopping with my mom and my mom saw someone she used to work with and introduced me as her daughter, saying that I'll be 20 and I'm moving to England in two weeks. The guy didn't bat an eye at the rest and just said, "20?! You look 15. Hahahahaha." Like everything else was discredited because I look young. It's not cute.

And if I hear one more, "You'll be thankful for it when you're older!" I'm going to seriously hurt someone.
