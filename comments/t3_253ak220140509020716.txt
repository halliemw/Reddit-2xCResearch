I know what you meant.  I used to work in a downtown area, and office and favorite pizza place were a few blocks apart, like 3 over and 4 down or something, so you could zigzag any way you wanted to.

One of those paths took you straight through the bus exchange area.  Holy crap.

Let's just say, if a colleague (male) and I (female) went together to lunch, we usually cut through the bus stop area (it was just the natural progression, to go that way) and no one ever said "boo" but if I went alone, I always avoided going that way because I couldn't walk through there without at least 5 cat calls.  I think it has more to do with them assuming you're available vs. not available than anything else.
