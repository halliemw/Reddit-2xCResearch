Depending on the age of your siblings, domestic violence in front of minors is considered child abuse in some states. 

Honestly, there's not a whole lot you can do except call the cops next time or have your sister call. Depending on the level of injury, the state can press charges, though it's not likely for a few face scratches. 

My dad only decided to get sober when my mom threatened to leave and take my sister and I with her. I wish you the best dealing with this situation, but abuse victims have to make the decision to end the relationship on their own, and your dad has to hit bottom before he decides to make changes, which apparently hasn't happened for him yet. Good luck!!
