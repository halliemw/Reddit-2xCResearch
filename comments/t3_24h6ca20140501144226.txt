I started taking the pill around 17 due to ovarian cysts. It was what was recommended at the time so that's what I did. I kept with the pill for more than 10 years because I didn't find it a problem to remember to take it. I did try a few different brands of pills over the years because they are formulated a little differently and some affected my adversely.

After I gave birth to my son, I chose the Mirena IUD. Having a newborn, I liked the idea of not having to remember to take the pill. And I really liked the idea that I might stop having periods altogether. 

I just don't like the idea of the patch. And (for me) it is easier to remember to take a pill everyday than to remember once a week or once a month to change the patch. 

I wouldn't choose the nuva ring because of the way I am built. Meaning my OB has told me that my uterus is tipped and I would have a hard time putting it in and removing it. I can't even reach myself to feel the Mirena string. I'm also petite with small hands and that plays into the reach-ability factor for me as well.
