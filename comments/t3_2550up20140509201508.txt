That's something I'll have to look into!  It's never bothered me but I swim in the river.  Small town, no local pool or anything like that and non students can't use my campuses gym without paying an exhorbitant daily fee so river seems to be easier.  I like being active but I prefer outdoor activities, hiking, climbing, things like that.  :)  Keeps my interest more than a standard kind of workout, but I do want to get back into jogging too.
