I have suffered from debilitating period pain, mostly in high school when my mother could excuse the absence.  I learned how to deal with it, then, and haven't needed to miss work, or even my college classes, to deal with it.

That said, I'm lucky, not every woman has that experience.  However, I believe, in the US, that many women would be able to get some sort of Medical Leave accommodation for an every month problem.

And, like the article cites, I have no desire to share the details of my cycle with my supervisor on up.
