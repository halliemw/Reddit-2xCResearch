I think that it's not just a question of people being unable to "feed the trolls" because they want to argue their side of the issue.  I also think that it's easier to react to shitty arguments than good ones, and so people spend a lot of time reacting to bad arguments to reassure themselves that theirs is the right side, and the "wrong" side has no good points.  I think that's ultimately part of why the crazy opinions get a lot of attention.

If someone writes a reasonable critique of Obamacare that most people disagree with, it'll get less attention than someone saying "GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH MY MEDICARE", which lets people sit around and talk about how much smarter they are than the opposition.
