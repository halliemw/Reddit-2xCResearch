I see a public benefit in breeding responsibly. I think if any of the scenarios you mentioned are even remote possibilities, you're in no place to have a baby. If the parents can't take a little time off in the beginning, where do you think the support stops? Do you think that a partial year off solves their problems? Do we double the cost of this benefit by giving dad the time off too?

The big piece that bugs me here, though, is this: let's say for a minute there is a *public* benefit to this. Why should the employer  *individually* pay for this *public* benefit?  Too often when we talk about these types of impacts on businesses, the reaction is, "Oh well, we can take it out of the shareholders' huge profits," or "the fat cat CEO won't miss it."  In the case of big businesses , most of us ARE the shareholders, either directly or through a retirement fund. Far more often, though, the "fat cat CEO" is also the person who takes out the trash, and is making a very personal financial decision about whether the company can afford to hire someone else. The company that (s)he owns is her/his job, and in many cases they can't afford that same time off for themselves. I'm not talking about WalMart and BP here. I'm talking about the restaurants, auto repair shops, bowling alleys and the like that comprise a huge piece of our economy.
