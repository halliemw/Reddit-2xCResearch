Tonight, let us drink and wallow in our sorrow. But tomorrow, or the first day when you can, this could be time used to work upon yourself and addressing (with yourself, with your close group of friends, with strangers on the internet) your handling of your emotions and proactive ways to deal with anxiety. I'm wishing the best for you, OP.
