Oh I see, you weren't on birth control, didn't use a condom and then didn't want or care to use plan B.  I get it......you were trying to get pregnant!!!  I'm sure you discussed this with your boyfriend at length before you engaged in sexual activity.  After all, parenthood is one of the biggest decisions one can make right?
