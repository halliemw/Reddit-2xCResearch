I grew up poor and I had no one to teach me about this thing called "College" or its alternatives. I see tons of comments leaning towards the STEM side of it but I think just getting the idea into their minds is important enough. 

Also - I wish someone introduced me to robotics at that age. Maybe do something with a Lego mindstorm set (or similar)?
