I sympathize with you about the chubby chipmunk cheeks, I have them too. I've always loved pixie-style haircuts, but my cheeks and those haircuts together make me look like a prepubescent boy. My hair has to be at least to my chin in the front to balance out my face :/

Unfortunately, without looking at you, I can't make any recommendations to help you feel better about yourself. I would definitely explore getting new glasses though, there are a lot of new styles out that weren't available 6-8 years ago, you might find something you like better!
