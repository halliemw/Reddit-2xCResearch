This was a wonderful read. Very interesting to hear about the various cultural impacts having alopecia had on your life...it's odd and upsetting that it's adults who do most of the mocking in these sorts of cases where people look different than "normal". I'm sorry you had to endure that :(

Good luck with the wig shopping!
