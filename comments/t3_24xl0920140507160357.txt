I figured it'd be a huge undertaking, but I didn't even think about taxes :(

Hooray for volunteering! There are SO many opportunities for donating and volunteering that it's hard to decide what to do sometimes. I've decided to pick a few causes every year that I'll pour effort into, and let that short list be fluid so I can pick something new next year.
