Thank you for your kind words. I'm actually a woman, but I appreciate the sentiment either way. I'm so happy to hear that you're doing this for your kids, my siblings and I would have treasured something similar from our dad rather than sifting through old boxes looking for any old family videos that may or may not exist. 
Confession time: I did a bit of creeping on your previous posts (and cried a lot because you remind me very much of my dad) and just wanted to reiterate that you are so very brave and awesome. I love that you ran a marathon and I saw the picture of you with your bike at chemo. My dad loved riding his bike and would go out as often as possible until he could barely walk let alone ride his bike. It was a red road bike, not much different looking from yours, that he slowly built over a year, buying the parts and pieces on various eBay auctions. Now it's hanging in our garage because none of us ride very often and it would feel odd using his special bike even if we did. Sorry for blathering on, but I just spent the last thirty minutes or so reading your old posts and watching your videos (I loved where your fellow chemo "inmates" beat death up) and I need to outpour some of this emotional nonsense before I have to go to work. 
Thank you for letting me have this little moment.
