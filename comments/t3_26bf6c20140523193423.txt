I agree with you but there is no way for me to know if that is happening or not. So I don't worry about it unless I have a reason to worry about it.    

If, in that situation, my boss was saying/hinting about how I wouldn't make a good leader because I am not a man then I have more information to go on. But just having a man chosen over me for a position isn't going to send me up in arms about sexism. Especially if it was an unconscious decision on the part of the boss. Besides that, if it were in fact sexism that made my boss choose a man over me then thats not who I want to work for.    


I know that sexism can be subtle. I can see it in other things not directly related to me. However, in the cases where its so subtle/unconscious then I don't really see why I should be worked up about that.
