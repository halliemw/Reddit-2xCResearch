Advocating for more women being included in history is a feminist issue though. I don't see any "egalitarians" advocating for it. I don't see any egalitarian 'movement' at all. I see people trying to use that word to justify not using the term feminist and nothing else. And where in the article that the word "mansplaining" was used?

3rd wave feminism actually isn't sexist or exclusionary. It actually values men very much and seeks to break down unnecessary gender roles that hurt them, while also being inclusive of those who aren't cisgender, among other things.
