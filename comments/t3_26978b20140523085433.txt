You should have the police number and video ready to record. Even if you get audio it will solidify your claims. Don't call your boyfriend, what is he going to do, teleport you out of there with his mind? It will only send him into a needless panic probably and he would be helpless at a far distance. He will be there for support when you are ready to talk. However police will be far more prepared to protect if you can get a hold of them. Tip: if you make acquaintance with your local law enforcement officers/patrolmen they may be more vigilant about the areas where you tell them about incidents happening.
