It seems to me that you are on the right track then. Education is important, and I think bettering yourself and improving your earning power is making a significant contribution to your relationship, even it's not as tangible as what your boyfriend is doing.

When you're done with school, you'll get to decide what kind of job you want. You'll have more choices and be more informed about what you want to do. At that point, if you feel bad about inequalities in your relationship, it might make sense to consider finding a full-time job. For now, focus on getting the most out of your courses and learning as much as possible. 

You should assume that you'll enter the job market once you've graduated. Why wouldn't you want to do that? Two incomes would give you and your boyfriend more freedom in the future, and it sounds like you're uncomfortable feeling like you're not contributing enough financially. That will be a lot easier to handle if you look at it as a temporary state of affairs.
