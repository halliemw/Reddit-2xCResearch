I would agree with that. But it's very "easy" to make a choice not to cheat when you simply can not form attraction or an attachment to another person.

It's like putting food in front of someone. Their favourite food, and food they find revolting. And telling them not to eat the revolting food.

For some people they only have the choice of their favourite food, and another food they enjoy as well.
