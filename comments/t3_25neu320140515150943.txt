It's ok. You are making the right decision for your health. My Daughter is 19. She has decided not to have children. And I'm sure that the reason is because, when she was 14 she had Rheumatic Fever ( an Auto immune Disease) Her body has never been the same. She still has strange, random symptoms Drs. don 't understand. I pretty sure , she realizes she would be risking a great deal by having a baby. You are NOT wrong.
