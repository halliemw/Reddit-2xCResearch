> how do you feel? Do you feel guilty or angry or icky? Does it feel wrong to have sex with a person who badgers you to do it? If you answer yes, then you know if this kind of sex is right for you.

Answer is definitely yes. 

And I would probably be very put off if someone I didn't have a history with was begging for sex...
