Fuck, it's starting already. Every year on Reddit, there are posts all over the front page from people complaining about their mother or asking why we celebrate people for pooping out a baby. The women's subreddits are no better, with everyone talking about how there is no joy in Mother's Day because of miscarriage or the death of their own mothers. It's endless posts of people complaining about the holiday and how shitty it is. Father's Day? No one has a problem with that one. 

I normally try to be really sympathetic to people who have undergone loss. The thing is, there is an infant loss remembrance day in October. Many people light candles on that day to recognize parents who are grieving. We don't need to tell mothers that they can't have one day to be recognized for what they do. They don't need to be guilted. It's OK to have one fucking day out there for moms. Celebrate your mom. Celebrate your grandma. Celebrate being a mom or a pet mommy. If you don't have any of those things, it's OK to be sad, but, FFS, don't tell everyone else why they should be guilt-ridden instead of celebrated. How would you feel if, on our birthday, people kept telling you how much they hate birthdays because the people they loved who died no longer get to celebrate birthdays? Wouldn't you think, "Well, thanks for pissing on my parade." There is a time and a place to discuss loss, but guilting moms for Mother's Day isn't the right time or place.
