I feel like something prolife people often don't understand is that nobody LIKES having an abortion. It's a decision you make when you know it's what is in everybody's best interest, including your own. Questioning if you really want to bring a child into a situation where people might resent it is good and all, but it's ok to think of your life too. If you can't take care of yourself or be happy with a baby, you shouldn't have a baby. The idea is exciting, but sometimes it's just the wrong time. You'll have your chance to have one when you know the time is right for you, and everyone will be happier for it.

My sister had an abortion, and honestly it was probably the best decision she could have made. I made it very clear I would support whatever choice she made, because it was HER CHOICE. At the time she was still in the depths of alcoholism, suicidal, and very unstable in every sense. The guy who got her pregnant was abusive, and had 4 other kids all by different women. It was not a good situation. She's much better now today, and just graduated college. While it would have been fun to have a little niece; not at the expense that it would have cost my sister.
