The pill had more options, and I could work with my doctors to find the right hormone cocktail.

The patch made me break out and my boobs huge. Never tried the ring because I use a menstrual cup.

Edit: I tried a copper IUD but my periods were insanely painful and my moods fluctuated too much without a pill regulating my hormones.
