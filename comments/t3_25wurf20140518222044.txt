Thing is, aside from the making friends issue--I don't think I *am* socially inept. At least not to a "wow, she went full mouthbreather right out the gate, didn't she?" degree. Without going into too much detail, I have a job that requires me to spend a lot of time in front of customers--providing information, speaking on (and even conducting) panels at conventions, etc. At this, I excel. I'm naturally introverted and shy (gee, wonder why, childhood?!), but I've learned how to present myself and interact with people well. I'm an excellent public speaker. I make people laugh. 

I'm just not sure why this can't translate into my personal life, somehow. I fully admit that I could be the one with the problem. I'm sure there's more I could do. But I am so incredibly stumped.

I did shoot off a very polite and professional email to the group moderators inquiring as to the reason for my rejection. (Literally one sentence.) If they respond, maybe it will offer some insight.
