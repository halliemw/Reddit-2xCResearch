>I will undergo a radical hysterectomy  
  
My first thought on that was "damn, that sucks", because I've had a C-section. Recovery is going to be a bitch. After all, I didn't have anything removed, and it was "No driving for 6 weeks. No lifting anything heavier than baby for 6 weeks". My belly felt weird (still does in other ways), I struggled to get in and out of bed, and walking got painful pretty fast. I hope it goes smoothly for you.  
  
>I'm amazed by the number of friends (usually female friends) whose first concern has been for my ability to bear children. Will I lose that ability? Yes. However, I'm trying to focus on not dying right now  
  
Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure that in the scheme of things, staying alive is far more important than being able to have a kid of your own. Besides, if you want a child (or two... or three) in the future, you can adopt if that's your thing.
