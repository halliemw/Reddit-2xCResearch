Don't speak for other people that you aren't party to.  

Any time a conversation turns into a troll baiting shit pile in /r/girlgamers you just have to check the troublemaker's post history and "TA-DA!" they're a /r/againstmensrights poster.  

It's the only reason why I know about you people. Otherwise I couldn't give a shit what you do.
