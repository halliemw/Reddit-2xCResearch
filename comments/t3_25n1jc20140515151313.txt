So, I don't know anything about you except from this post. And I don't have kids but I know enough about it to know that it can be pretty messy in a variety of ways. So your "dealing with come" comment kind of struck me. Hopefully you can learn to deal with that before you actually have a kid, because I imagine you'll be even less pleased cleaning up poop, pee, vomit, etc.
