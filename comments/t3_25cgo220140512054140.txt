All of the symptoms have worn off of these antidepressants I just started (for the first time!) and I'm actually starting to feel like a normal person for a change. Also, husband and I are putting an offer on a new home today. It may just be a mobile home, but I am *so* sick of apartment life and excited about possibly having a place that will feel a little more like a home and not just a place to live!
