I absolutely adore baking yesterday I made a corned beef pie and chocolate brownies and my other half just loved them it made me feel so good! 

I love my teeny tiny makeup collection (although I would love more!) and love being in dresses and skirts. 

I'm looking into a few new hobbies and have started gardening (we have a yard so at the moment it's just flowers in pots but they're starting to blossom and I'm insanely proud of myself!) 

I've also been thinking about learning to knit and to crochet after seeing some of the AMAZING stuff created on those subs.
