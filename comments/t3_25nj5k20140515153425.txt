Ah, I've had a 'friend' who I only hung out with because my actual friend was friends with her. The first thing I did was blatantly state to my actual friend how I felt about the other girl, and how I was not going to get along with her but I would be happy to act civilly so that I wouldn't put my friend in an awkward position. 

Luckily my friend understood the situation and was accommodating. Once that was sorted out, I didn't feel like I was keeping some big hatred-secret so I was much more comfortable hanging out in the group. I didn't feel obligated to prove that I liked the other girl anymore, so we just ignored each other for the most part, and even got along in some respects. When we did cross paths I completely stopped holding my tongue and called her out on her bullshit when I saw it.

I mean it wasn't ideal, but we managed to all stay in the same group and get along.
