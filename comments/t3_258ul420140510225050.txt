Ugh! I had sex ed in one of the more conservative parts of Canada and even then we got proper info. The teacher had been a teen mom herself and wanted to make sure we had all the info we needed to avoid teen pregnancy. It was like a litany of 'birth control pills, condoms, spermicide!' ha ha ha. She brought out one of the circular packs of BC pills to show us, the teachers at your school probably would have fainted!
