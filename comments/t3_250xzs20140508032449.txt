That's a behavior you see from certain people with an alcoholic brain.  I'm older, and have seen this behavior in people over the years.  Sounds like he was blackout drunk.  Very scary.

My suggestion is unless he's never going to drink again, or get help, you are better off ending things now.  It won't get better with time if he continues to drink, that's been my experience.  Some folks just shouldn't drink, but when they do, things can go badly quickly.
