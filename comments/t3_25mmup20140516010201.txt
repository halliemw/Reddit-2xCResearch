The victim has the choice, but can choose to just go to the school instead of the police.  Since laws against making a false report deal only with reports to actual police departments, this is subject to abuse. 

Edit: I should add that I'm not entirely against these, because I do see the need they are trying to fill, but I think there should be other ways to achieve this.  Perhaps retraining orders, changing of housing arrangements, changing the burden of proof requirements, etc...
