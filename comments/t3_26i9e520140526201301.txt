I am so sorry that this happened to you:( I am glad that your school system supported you and removed him from the school. My school system took me out of the classroom and had me take my tests, do hw, etc. in the superintendent's office. I thought it was pretty stupid on their part to remove me and not him. It almost made it seem as though I was the problem.
