This is a good point. Really, it's a sub for women, and it should primarily cater to it's targeted audience--not as an echo chamber I mean, but in regards to benefit. 

It might be different for others, but I am really sick of in the real world being expected to constantly put my needs/wants second primarily because I am a woman. I see different expectations and consequences constantly for the men around me and I am sick of being seen as a deviant when I exhibit 'male' qualities. I am not aggressive, but I am assertive and am sick of getting punished for putting my thoughts out there. It was nice to have a retreat from that.
