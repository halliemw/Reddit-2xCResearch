Paps don't catch everything, and it's important to pay attention to your body! A friend of mine just found out she has endometrial cancer. She had fibroids removed a bit over a year ago, and her pap(which can very occasionally catch endometrial cancer) from six months ago was clear. She'd thought her fibroids were coming back, and then they found cancer. She's now recovering from a radical hysterectomy before she starts chemo.
