I think 22 is still young enough to show respect to actual adults.

Now, (I'm 23) I have no problem with men as it is "sir" all the way, but I try to be careful with women, and I do my best to quickly decide wether it will be a "mademoiselle" or a "madam".

Either way, they're lucky to be called something in my opinion, and you are definitely not doing anything wrong.
