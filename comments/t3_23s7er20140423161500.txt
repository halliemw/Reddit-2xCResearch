I've definitely had my ass grabbed at concerts. I was talking to some guys at a show once and the one said he just kept his hands up near his chest so his hands wouldn't accidentally touch anyone's ass as they pushed past. It was appreciated but it's pretty easy to tell the difference between it's crowded and my hand bumped into your butt and I felt like it was okay to grab it.
