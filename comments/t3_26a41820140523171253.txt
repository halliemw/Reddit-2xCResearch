Yes I did think about adoption. I just couldn't do it.

Edit: Sorry my response was so short. I want to better explain myself. I have an older half sister who my mother put up for adoption. I have seen my mom struggle through out the years by not being able to be a bigger part in my sisters life (they live on the other side of the country). Knowing that she was in fact her birth mother...but not really her mother at all. Its just not something I felt I was able to handle.
