What you're saying is pretty vague but I feel compelled to ask: Have you sought psychological treatment about this? Have you considered it/are these things that you want to move past in your life?

And if the answer is no that's just how I'm shaped by my experience, that's fine. Just my little PSA that help is out there for many people.
