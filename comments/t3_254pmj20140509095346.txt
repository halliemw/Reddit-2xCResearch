You know, I don't want to be mean or harsh in this time of anxiety for you, but you really need to be more responsible. You're 19, not 14, so youth and innocent is not an excuse. The pull out method is a risky method. You should be using a condom for the first 1-2 months of birth control. You should not be skipping periods already, with BC you just started. Everyone's body is different, and yours needs time to get used to the new regimen in its own way. 

Regarding your symptoms- they can all be side effects of your BC, you've only just started it. Keep taking those stick tests just to be sure. You can buy them in bulk on amazon.

I sincerely hope for you that this is a false scare, and that you're fine. And that you've learned a valuable lesson. Talk to whoever prescribed you the BC. be honest with them. Ask them about skipping periods. Google what BC you are on, and learn about it. Best of luck to you! Fingers crossed!
