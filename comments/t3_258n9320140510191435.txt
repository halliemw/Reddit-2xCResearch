I think bikinis are more for looking good on the beach, not swimming in the water! Fuck that, I wanna be comfy, not look good.

My current problem is finding a tankini top that works for aquacise. When you're doing jumping jacks in the water it really sucks to have the belly fill up with water and flare out on the way down.
