When it comes to qualities like attractiveness, I paraphrase to myself the words that Guinan said to Data  when he was sad about not understanding humor: being attractive, or being young, is not the end-all and be-all of being human. Sure, it's nice to be attractive. But being a good and worthwhile person is so much more complex than that, and you are so much more than just your physical appearance.

What I have been doing recently is judging my appearance in a more complex way, one which ties in to my perception of my personality. When you look at your eyes, what sort of person do you see? I see a mischievous, but determined person; a bit of a jokester, but someone who stands up for what she believes in. And I love seeing that, and I know that I can keep that no matter how old I get, and that no one can undermine it, because it is me, inside.
