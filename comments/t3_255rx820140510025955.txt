Vomiting...?!? That sounds horrible! I felt so shy about my menstruation that age. Just like "Oh my God, if the boys figure out that my body does the stuff that most women's bodys do, they'll tease me to death." Then again, a grown-up person like your teacher back then should have been 100% discreet and sensitive about this topic.
