Friends. You need some friends right now, you need a supportive group of people who like you for who you are. I reread this twice (and skimmed once) and didn't see mention of your friend group -- if you have one, spend time with them to remind yourself that people like you for you. If you have a good, supportive family, spend time with them. I've never been spectacular at making friends, but there are groups on meetup for nearly any interest -- try joining some of those. (Personally, I have a book group) 

Go immerse yourself in your hobbies and interests. It may feel like your faking it at first, because, well, when your life sucks trying to feel happy feels fake. But continue to do the things you enjoy, that make you feel good, as you get back on your feet. 

Edit because I love Captain Awkward: [How to get a Team You](http://captainawkward.com/2012/12/31/4719/)
