You are looking at things improperly. As a man if I want to go find a strong male character that is not all muscle I can and it's pretty easy. There are lots of media outlets where men are not overly beefy while still being considered strong, Ironman is easy to point out but not alone. Women on the other hand do not have this ease of access. 

Finding a strong, female character is difficult, can you name one that isn't a superhero? I would count the new Tomb Raider, but they had to reboot her entire character for that. It's much more difficult for women and girls to have a strong characters in media and the few that exist are also sexualized. 

The problem is not "Superheros are fantasy don't take it personally", we all get that. Both men and women fully understand that shooting webs from your hands is not normal, but women have far fewer non-super human people to look up to. Media bombards them constantly with hot women who dress suggestively and we get Thor *and* Kevin James (King of Queens) as people to look up to in some way. Yes, fat white males have a representative with a hot wife but there is no female equivalent. Louie did a good episode on a similar issue fairly recently where it discussed why men are allowed to be fat and women aren't. 

Man I hope that helped explain the issue here.
