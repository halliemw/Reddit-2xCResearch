> I think if any of the scenarios you mentioned are even remote possibilities, you're in no place to have a baby. If the parents can't take a little time off in the beginning, where do you think the support stops? Do you think that a partial year off solves their problems?

Not being able to afford to live without an income is not synonymous with being in no place to have a baby. My friend's baby recently died. He took time off from work but is paid by commission so he was only receiving a small base pay for the time off, but it was still income versus the no income that you are proposing. Prior to their baby dying, they were not struggling, though they watched their spending money and their savings were small. At the end of the month when his baby died, they couldn't pay their mortgage payments, credit card bills, hospital copays for the ER, and the cost of the funeral. I would love to see you tell him to his face that if he couldn't survive without his income for a few weeks, then he was in no position to have a child in the first place.
