i think this is one of those times where you have to allow yourself to experience the emotions while simultaneously reminding yourself that they're not logical. it's okay to feel lost and hopeless because you think you're going to be alone forever, but at the same time, you're 22 and it's been 6 months. i think that if you try to look at the situation objectively, you'll agree that hope is not lost for you just yet ;)

break-ups can be truly traumatizing, especially because you two dated for quite a while and seemed to have a special connection. it's okay to grieve, but try not to let your grief distort your thinking. if you believe in soulmates: clearly your ex isn't your soulmate, because if he was, you'd still be together. and if you don't believe in soulmates: chances are, there is someone else out there who you will fall in love with just as deeply and genuinely as you did with your ex.

i know it's easier said than done, but try not to focus too much on the past. what's done is done, but you can still decide your future. sit down and really consider whether or not you're ready to be dating yet. and regardless of what you conclude, continue to work on yourself and stay involved with family and friends.
