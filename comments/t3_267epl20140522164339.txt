In your case, sure.  Did you READ OP's situation?  They had talked about not wanting a child but she changed her mind once she knew she was pregnant.  Now, that's a totally valid way to feel, but how can she justify forcing someone else to support her knowing that they don't want the child?  Also, this can be emotionally very hard on a man too, because someone they didn't want to start a family with is mothering their child.  This isn't 1952, it's 2014.

OP seems to have a good neck on her shoulders and talks about setting herself and the child up for success with her parents help.  Using the legal system to force someone to financially raise a child after you'd both agree not to have a child is straight fucked.

Also, I'm glad you've been sharing your own personal anecdotes, but your own experiences aren't the best facts to use in a logical dialogue.
