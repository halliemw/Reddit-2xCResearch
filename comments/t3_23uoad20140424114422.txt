The example I used was "negative comments about black people".  So to extend your "rude people" example, it would be like making a shirt that said: "I hate rude black people" or "I hate rude women".  Sure, we all dislike rudeness, but specifically calling out a subset of the population based on race or gender as if rudeness were somehow especially associated with that group is racist or sexist.
