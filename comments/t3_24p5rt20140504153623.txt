I know how you feel. I've slept with around 5 men, and the 5th one - he's my client. I'm a one man prostitute.

For me, acceptance came with time. When I broke up with the very first man I had sex with, I had these pangs of guilt and shame. What happened to 'saving myself'? Wouldn't it have made things 'special'? Wouldn't a man find me more desirable if I was a virgin? The strange thing is, I never wanted the man I was with to be a virgin.

I think those ideas come not only from religion but from things like romance novels (where the ideal woman is portrayed as inexperienced, generally) and other kinds of media. And it all fits into the patriarchal world that we inhabit.

It took introspection and a lot of time to understand that it doesn't work like that. For a start, 'virginity' is such a vague concept. So it had such little relevance. As long as I'm being safe, it  doesn't matter how many partners I've had. Why does it matter? Get over all those preconceived notions. Men suffer from it, too. But when you find a man who's on the same wavelength as you with regards to this issue you'll realise that your 'count' means nothing as long as you are safe about it, and in case of any unfortunate incidents - honest about it.
