My sister does this. She'd buy some sort of body hair bleach that looks like a white cream and put it on her arms for the directed amount of time. I believe she did this like once every 1-2 months as needed.

I think she still does this years later, and it never did anything to her skin. I can't say it is the same for everyone since skin sensitivities vary among people but you can try once and see.
