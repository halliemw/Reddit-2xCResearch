This is how patriarchal societies work.  It is only rape when it causes the women to lose value before the eyes of society.  Only when it makes her unmarriageable or when it causes shame to her father, sons and brothers.  The personal attack / loss of dignity / devastating experience is of no serious consequence if she's married already.  Oh, India.  Shame, shame on you.
