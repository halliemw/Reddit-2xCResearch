I took her quote to mean that you can't work all the time, like 15 hour days and travel two out of every three weeks, and be a good parent without taking time off. I don't think she was blaming other working mothers, just saying that her career and others like it aren't conducive to good parenting without modifying your schedule and not taking on every project that comes your way.
