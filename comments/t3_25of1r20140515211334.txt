I have been planning to take a self-defense course for so long!  Hopefully I will be able to this summer.    Is it possible to take a Nonviolent Crisis Intervention class totally online?  That does look like something that would be very helpful.

I always wonder (and worry), how during a crisis, people's response can either diffuse it or make it worse, and I always hope that if I ever find myself in a situation like that *someone* will know what to do.  This is problematic as best, I think it is better that I become the person who knows what to do, than simply hoping such person will be magically by my side in a risky situation.
