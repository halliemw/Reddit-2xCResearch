Yes (I like your name, btw - I love Anne Bancroft).  

Some of us do focus on this fact (I work somewhere that the assault/rape rate is very low...thankfully, although perhaps the fact that we all tell students to go directly to regular law enforcement might have something to do with that - who knows?)

I find that the colleges where rape is higher are exactly the ones that try to keep this out of the news/college mindset.

Shameful, really.  College campuses are known for higher assault rates (and those that are in big urban centers have the greatest problems - this used to be talked about in the media as often as we talk about gluten, but no more).  If that's changed and campuses are safer, I haven't seen the research.
