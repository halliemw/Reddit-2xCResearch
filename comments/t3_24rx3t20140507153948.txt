I'd like to point out I was in the positives when attempting to agree or come around to your viewpoint and you see what happens when AMR got a hold of it.  

I'm okay with wasting their time that they feel the need to come into general women forums in order to brigade. I've got footholds, pull, and places where people listen to me elsewhere.  

You're talking about a group that embarrassed themselves on /r/videos a couple of weeks ago and add fuel to the fire by trumpeting their misstep up on their very landing page.  

I'm okay being an opponent of that sort of collective behavior. It's never going to go out of style, it's always going to come in one form or the other.  

>In short, these actions show that MRA aren't really helping men, just attacking feminists.  

And AMR aren't really helping women, they're attacking ... masculinists? Provoking the neutral and then cannibalizing those of us that would've been on their side because they're nitpicky, little people, stirring up shit just to stir it and then return and retcon their actions in order to give them meaning.  

No. You can keep it.
