Most healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, pharmacists) will err on the side of caution and warn for all antibiotics (despite no scientific evidence for that recommendation), but only [rifampin](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/maryland/faqs-birth-control-users-28812.htm) has been shown to cause birth control to be ineffective.  And you'd definitely know if you had ever taken rifampin since it turns your body fluids (pee, sweat, tears, etc) bright red, plus it is only used for TB and a few other rare things. 

And yeah, for combined oral contraceptives (estrogen + progestin) you can miss one pill in a pack without issues, but I think OP was just being extra cautious.  Basically you need to make sure that you have [7 days of continuous pill use](http://shcs.ucdavis.edu/topics/contraception/pill-missed.html), so if you've missed more than one pill in the same week, then you need a back up method.

For progestin-only pills, if you take a pill more than 3 hours late though then you need a backup method for the next 2 days since those work different.
