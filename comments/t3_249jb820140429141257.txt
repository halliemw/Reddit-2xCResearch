A lot of men are paranoid about being falsely accused (or perhaps legitimately accused, in the case of some people).  A lot of them have this idea that any time a woman is angry with a man she can just call up the police and ruin his life in a second.  They imagine that it's super easy for a woman to just point the finger and screw a man over for good.  They also think that women frequently cry rape when they regret having sex.
