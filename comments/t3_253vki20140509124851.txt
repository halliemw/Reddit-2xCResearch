> i might have done the same thing to cheer you up

the thing is, getting hit on by strangers when you're pissed off DOESN'T cheer women up. it just adds to their stress. maybe she doesn't WANT to have a conversation with anyone when she's mad. i wouldn't. much less deal with some guy who is calling me beautiful and following me around. she's under no obligation to make this guy feel good about his shitty, not at all welcome "help."
