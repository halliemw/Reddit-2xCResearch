Thanks.

I'm not down on the link posts. There are a lot of great articles out there about women's issues, and I like reading them. I just point them out because this sub was almost exclusively self posts before. There used to be articles posted maybe once a day, at most, but now there are lots. That's not necessarily a bad change, but it is an indication of new users contributing in a different way from how the sub existed before, and in a less personal and more generic/distant/scholarly manner.
