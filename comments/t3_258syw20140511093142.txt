The only place I mentioned gender was when talking about the study which only included men. I can't draw any conclusions about women from the study, that would be bad science. 

And yes, all 3 of your points about why they admitted their rapes were correct, and that's why we need to educate people on what rape is and the things they shouldn't do. I'm not sure what you're struggling with here. 

I suggest actually reading the paper you demanded rather than reading the first line and dismissing it, then skim reading because you don't want to risk being wrong.
