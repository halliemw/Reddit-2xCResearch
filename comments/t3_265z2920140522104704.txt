Some simple tips:


-Bring a first aid kit along.

-Always be aware of your surroundings.

-Know where your friends are at or have a reliable way to contact them (that is, if your phone dying is an issue bring an extra battery or something to charge it with).

-Have a meeting place to go if you do get separated from the group so you can always find each other.

-Note where the medics/police will be.


Other than that, have a good time. Festivals are a lot of fun!
