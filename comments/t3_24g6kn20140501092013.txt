To summarize, to help women and reduce abortions, they 

(1) make sure that pregnant women who took drugs, or drank, or may do so are only safe from jail if they abort,

(2) make sure that pregnant women who took drugs, or drank, or may do so do not seek prenatal care, thus significantly increasing the chance of fetal problems.

Ah yes, you have to appreciate the "pro-life" outlook that drives these votes.
