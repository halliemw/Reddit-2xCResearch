I had a mole on my cheek that I didn't like and had it removed. It was slightly raised and dark brown.

I do not have any scarring at all. I had it cauterized off and it took 4 treatments. After each treatment,I put antibiotic ointment on it until it closed up and then put mederma on it after that.

There is always a chance that you could end up with a scar and it could look worse than what you started with.
