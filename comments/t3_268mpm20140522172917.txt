True, but apart from the issue of paternal age being possibly linked to certain disorders and conditions in their kids, there's also the consideration of how much time you'll have with the kid. Obviously nobody's life is guaranteed and each of us could potentially die tomorrow. But generally speaking, a man who becomes a father in his 40's or 50's will have less time with his kids than one in his 20's. Applies for moms too of course. That's a lot of the reason why I wanted to have kids in my early to mid 20's.
