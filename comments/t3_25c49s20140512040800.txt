I've used the cheese graters, and they do work far better than a pumice stone.  I'd suggest getting a stiff foot brush as well, or one of those [combo jobs](http://m4.sourcingmap.com/photo_new/20120418/g/ux_a12041800ux0392_ux_g03.jpg).  Alternate the brush and the grater on your heels when you get out of the shower.  [Callus razors](http://www.buymebeauty.com/images/revlon/050925.jpg) work faster, but you have to be careful and use a light touch with those.

You can also get some heavy duty moisturizer, slather your feet up, and put on some socks before going to bed to soften them up, then use the brush in the morning.
