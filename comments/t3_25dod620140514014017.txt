This is actually untrue. Your body is entirely prepared for sporadic eating. It reserves fat solely for the use when food is unavailable, therefore to attempt to store fat while fasting completely defeats the purpose. Starvation mode is actually when your body fat is well below sustainable levels and your body tries to retain in order to keep you alive.
