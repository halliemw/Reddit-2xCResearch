I was on a generic oral low hormone birth control for about five years to control cramping and then decided to stop and see if my cramps were any better.  They were.  Honestly, I didn't notice any changes in my body or my mood, but I did develop some heinous acne. 

A few years later the cramps came back and I went back on oral bc.  A few years later I stopped again because I lost my health insurance.  I didn't have any bad effects from stopping that time.  I did think going off bc was making me lose weight for a while but it turns out I had a thyroid disorder.
