I don't know much about the camping/hiking side of things, but doing that much traveling I would recommend you get a cheap spare cell phone without a service plan. This way if your phone dies or breaks you can always have a way to call 911 (assuming you have reception) for any reason. Anyways that trip sounds like a lot of fun, I hope you make some great memories.

Also most public libraries in the US have computers with internet so if you get stranded you can always look up maps or reach out to anyone you need to.
