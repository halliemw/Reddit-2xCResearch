Well, if me or my partner feel like there is an issue that needs to be addressed and its an issue that is serious enough or sensitive enough, like say she feels like I don't want to interact with her or I feel like shes being emotionally manipulative then whomever has the issue will say or text, etc. "lets have a Tuesday" (this has a long back story with us but try to pick something not often used in conversation). We will set time aside to talk (skype or call or whatever) about the issue until both parties feel understood and the problem has been resolved or we have a plan to resolve the problem. There are a few things to keep in mind, you can make some rules for engaging in serious relationship problem solving discussions like don't yell, don't accuse, don't insult each other, don't bring things up that are unrelated. My partner and I do not have a worked out list because we're too lazy and already know each other well enough to know what sets each other off, the most important thing to keep in mind is that the "space" is absolutely ruined if someone is being consciously selfish and in order for this to help at all, all parties must be invested in hearing each other out and working towards bettering the relationship, not putting someone down.
