And could the women who keep posting on reddit that women "don't really need or expect an orgasm every time they have sex" please please please stop spreading that misinformation? 

It gives (some) men a pass to just get off themselves, thinking that she will be happy pleasing him and just getting a cuddle afterwards! Come on! I both need and want an orgasm every time I have sex. Cuddling is nice but not at all equivalent.
