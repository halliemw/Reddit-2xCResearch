Sex during pregnancy isn't really considered a problem. I would be careful about the keto diet, though. There aren't really any human studies out right now, but [mouse studies](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/13/198) suggest some potential harmful effects for mother and baby. If it's something you want to do, I'd suggest discussing it with your OB and a registered dietitian first. Of course it's entirely up to you and mouse models can't be extrapolated to humans perfectly, so it could be perfectly safe. Just do consider what little evidence we have before making a decision.
