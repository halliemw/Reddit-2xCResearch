Oh god, the first time I got it, I was abroad and and going crazy scratching.  I could not sleep at all.  I kept drinking water to flush it out but my body was determined to make cottage cheese in prolific amounts.  Every couple of hours I was DIGGING in there, flinging out cheesy loogeys.

I was doing everything I could to scratch the itch without physically scratching.   This included slapping and self-induced camel-toe'ing (while jumping around like a maniac).  Just before deciding to wave my arms like a lunatic and scream in frustration, I grabbed a giant bowl of ice cubes and paper towels.  Started folding ice cubes into paper towel squares and sticking it between my legs, replacing as the ice cubes melted.  Relief felt glorious.  Tedious, but glorious.

Thankfully it cleared out on its own and haven't gotten one since (fingers crossed).  I wonder what caused it though, since I (unfortunately) wasn't having any kind of sexy times during that period.
