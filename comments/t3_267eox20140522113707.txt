I absolutely agree with this. One of the biggest things for me when looking for a programming job is always the environment of the office, I  need to work somewhere where I can tell I won't be treated differently. Loads of guys seem to think I make too big a deal of atmosphere but I think very few understand just how frustrating it can be in the bad places.

(Except I would like to point out that some of us 'females' are awesome at programming and don't need help :P)
