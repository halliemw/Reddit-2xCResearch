Wow. This hits a little close to home. I had something similar happen (no drugs), and everyone in my life (my friends, family, local church members) gave the same response as the judge. "You need to forgive him so he get better and can start to heal."  

That makes me think that there is a whole other way of thinking out there. One where the rapist is the victim, and the true victim is the rapist's path to recovery. I get that these people want the rapist to improve and do better, but I don't get how they can completely disregard the true victim's feelings and safety.
