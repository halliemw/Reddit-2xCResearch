There's no receptionist, and no one really hangs out in the break room. (There's no tables or chairs, people just use the microwave and eat at their desks.) Most of my coworkers work from home or sit in a completely different building. 

The people who's cubes or offices are near me... I honestly have no idea who they are or what they do (or what team they're on). They mostly keep to themselves or to their own teams. I mean, I'll say 'hi' and 'how are you', but conversation usually just ends there. =/ I guess I could try more, but aside from a handful of people, they don't really work with me either. (I swear, my cube neighbor almost seems like he actively avoids me. Never makes eye contact with me, and I've seen him walk towards the elevators only to see me and then make a quick detour to the restrooms instead. (Ok, so the last one might just be in my head, but it was just so weird! haha)
