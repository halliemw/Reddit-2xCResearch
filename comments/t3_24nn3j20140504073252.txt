At first when I read this story, I thought, oh this isn't a problem for me because my university/departments/classes are so small that the professors I need to email already know me. But then I thought about my experiences emailing other faculty, mostly about things related to a student club, and how many emails went completely ignored. Now I'm wondering whether my gender played a role in that. Obviously I can't know for sure, but having had that experience, it makes me very angry to know that this is a pattern in academia.
