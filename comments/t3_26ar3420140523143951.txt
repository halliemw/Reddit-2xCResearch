As a tattooed person myself, I see where you're coming from. I am going to be a nurse (still in school), and I'd get a body suit tattoo'd if I could afford it and if it wouldn't be a problem with work, but I know it would for me. For me, I'm not getting tattoos anywhere that would be exposed by scrubs. I'm not sure what area of work you're looking to get into when you finish up in the army, but if you're going to be working someplace that you wouldn't typically wear short sleeves at, then bring that up with your husband. Or, perhaps wait until you've secured a good job that will be long term, and THEN start your half sleeve---get yourself established in your work place. I am seeing a lot more tattoo'd people in various professions that are not covering them up, which gives me confidence, but it's still something you want to be careful with. As much as I would like people to not judge my job skill potential based on my skin, we both know that's a long way ahead of us in the future and we may not live long enough for tattoos to be totally okay and nobody cares about them/judges on it.
