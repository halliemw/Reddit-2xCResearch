Sorry to say I think I'm gonna end up being one of them. I am so frickin sick to death of devil's advocate type comments, and the discussions they bring. It's almost all men debating each other, and trying to point out that this sub is not a good place for those types of discussions gets you downvoted to hell. 

If the mods could ban or discourage devil's advocate comments it might help, but I really feel like that's not going to happen, the mods don't give a rat's ass what's going on, and the sub is already pretty much ruined. Sorry.

Edit: also i thought i should mention 2xlite and femmethoughts, as alternatives here. They're obviously not as big as 2x, but they've definitely "getting there" as far as content and submissions go. Whether or not you all are sticking with 2x, I'd encourage you to subscribe to them, as a non - default alternative or companion to 2x. :)
