"Elect" may be something of a misleading term here, given how overwhelmingly dominant President Kagame and his party are, and how little dissent they tolerate.  The RPF puts forth a commendable number of women as candidates, above even what was required by Rwanda's constitution.  But those women were not confirmed in their positions in especially open or competitive elections.
