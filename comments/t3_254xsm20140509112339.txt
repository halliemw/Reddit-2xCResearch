i never minded these types of posts, because they were surrounded with a variety of other posts. Now our front page *only* contains this obvious attack of gross to scare away new users.

The excuse of 'these posts were always there' is not valid enough in this situation.

We argue that 'we're more than just our bodies' but today, it seems the 2XC hivemind is proving the opposite. Apparently all we are are pooping bleeding discharging bodies who cannot hold an intelligent conversation.
