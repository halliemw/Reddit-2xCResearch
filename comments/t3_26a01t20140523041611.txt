>Now, keep in mind, she's not fat, ugly, or dumb.


Why should I keep this in mind? Do you believe that it's ok to bully overweight or not conventionally attractive girls?


>What can I do in 1 days time?


In my opinion, there's only one, nuclear option to effectively deal with the your sister's being bullied - parents should move her to another school (or class). That's right, it's not possible to stop teens from bullying their victim, these little vicious creatures pick a person that is somewhat different and turn their life into hell. If you can force your parents to consider switching schools in one days' time - good, if no - I suppose sister just have to deal with the status of outcast. Or maybe her tormentors will get bored and find another victim, but there's nothing an outsider or even teacher can do. Support your sis, tell her that her classmates are morons and school will be over soon enough.
