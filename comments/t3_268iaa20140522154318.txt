Helena from Orphan Black represents a female power fantasy. Physically she's no different from the other clones - it's all the same actress after all! But she channels a feral intensity that makes it clear you do not mess with her. She looks deceptively scrawny but she's adept in hand to hand combat and firearms. You find yourself rooting for her, she's an avenger who lives by her own code (especially now that her handler is gone) who punishes the people who threaten her and her loved ones. Her vigilantism is both shocking and satisfying. She's the dark part of you that you wish could come out and right wrongs, a crazy force of nature. I don't think men would have the same reaction to Helena as women do.
