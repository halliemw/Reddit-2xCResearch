By kind responses, I mean please don't be mean or shame women more than they have already been shamed. I don't mind people saying, "I disagree", or "my preference is waxing", or "Actually I think that women should conform and shave". Those are opinions I am totally open to hearing. But I am referring to the jokingly unkind banter that often happens around body hair "Sasquatch", "Gross", etc.

With regard to evolutionary biology, it doesn't work that way.

Actually I love short guys. I just do. True, I don't love 400 LB guys, but I am open to all shapes and sizes, and to bring this back to evolutionary biology (a new favorite topic of mine), I do think we have a right to be attracted to people that are "healthy" and you know as well as I that a 400 lb person is not in good health.

I have no problem with your preference for shaving choosing guys you like that fit your standards. What I am asking is to speak positively about everyone's choices, to embrace diversity, and to stop shaming women for being themselves.
