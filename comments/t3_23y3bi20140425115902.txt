I think you're blowing their comment out of proportion. The bottom line is that the more you look conventionally attractive, the more likely you are to be, well, found attractive, be treated better, have more opportunities, etc. So, yes, you have your insecurities and that's fine, everyone does, but that doesn't make your problems equal to someone else's. It's like a millionaire complaining about the expense of replacing a car compared to a single mum on welfare needing a new car. Both are problems, but let's be honest about whose situation we'd rather be in. 

I realize insecurities aren't the same as money (the former being less rational and thus tougher to conquer) but I'm making this point to illustrate that there are obvious differences in the struggles if you consider how society also perceives you and not just how you feel about yourself. It's not as shocking of an accomplishment if we see a conventionally attractive person, who is supported by society, feel good about themselves. And we see that measure of accomplishment imposed on all sorts of things (eg accomplishing X task in spite of a disability - their accomplishments are even more "special" and provide more motivation because there was more to overcome). 

It seems like there's a competition among people to make their problems seem equal or worse to those of their peers and it's nuts. No, some have it worse. I have some privileges and some disadvantages in my life and I don't always need to feel like I have it just as tough as everyone else. 

That said, I agree with you that the most important point to drive home is that tons of people struggle to some degree when really we should all appreciate ourselves.
