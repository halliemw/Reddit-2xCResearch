I loooove TOG so much. When I moved to the city first I had a really hard time making friends and they were all so friendly and welcoming. They also have a craft night, which is great for a knitter like me! It's hard to get involves in places that you don't feel welcome in. I'm lucky to have such a brilliant space in my city which has so many women that are active in the women in tech movement! =)

Oh I didn't feel you were attacking me at all. I just wanted to make sure that you didn't feel I was saying that Ireland was a wonderful place for women in tech in general but more specifying that in my situation it is.
