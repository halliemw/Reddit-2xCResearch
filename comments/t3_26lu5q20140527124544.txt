The pressure you're feeling from outside forces is meaningless unless you give it relevance in your own life.  If you don't want to exercise 6 days a week, don't.  If you want to lose a few pounds, watch what you eat a little more closely and swap certain things out for healthier alternatives.  It's not a huge crisis as long as you're not currently jeopardizing your health.  It sounds like you're at a normal, healthy weight and I think that's where your answer lies.  

I don't know why you feel like a failure?  Just get over all that stuff you're hearing about "Buns of Steel" and "3-day detoxes" because it's all marketing crap.  

On a side note, you can enjoy yourself while losing weight if that's what you feel you need to do.  Losing weight does not have to be miserable.  I think the negative connotation is unhealthy for everyone.
