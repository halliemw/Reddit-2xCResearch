I hate the way they think about this. I have a feeling they assume men wouldn't come to a Wonder Women movie for dumb reasons, and especially the fact that DC and Warner Brothers thrives on toy sales over movie sales. DO YOU THINK THAT GIRLS WILL NOT BUY THESE TOYS? So you think they don't like strong role models?  /r
