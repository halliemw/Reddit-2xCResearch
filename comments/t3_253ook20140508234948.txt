As far as book ideas go, my mother just joined a book club this year and she and the other members use Goodreads lists a lot for suggestions- they have pretty much every topic you could think of, including lists specifically for books that are good for book clubs. The club my mom is part of tends to read more recently published books, like Gone Girl and The Ocean at the End of the Lane. They also host the club monthly at different members' houses, and rotate who hosts and who cooks dinner, so every month someone different does it.
