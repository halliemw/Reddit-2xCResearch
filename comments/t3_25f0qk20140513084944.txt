(First 10 seconds of realizing you've had your period) AWWWW YEEAAAH NO BABIES!

(Anytime after) Well, this is inconvenient. Of COURSE today is the day all my friends want to go on a all day hike. Looks like some raccoon is gonna be watching me change my tampon.

Also I'm always so fucking moody. But food tastes SOOOOOOOOO much better. And my boobs get bigger!
