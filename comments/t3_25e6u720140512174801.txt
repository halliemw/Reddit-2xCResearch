I don't shave my armpits anymore.  I think the last time was maybe 2007? Maybe.

I don't shave my nether regions at all.  I've done it on a whim a handful of times over the years, but haven't touched that either since '08.  (Yes, at one point I had pit hair and not pubic hair.)  And that was using a depilatory cream, actually, not shaving.  

I shaved my legs in I think January of this year.  December or January.  I will not shave them again until I am no longer pregnant, if then.  (I actually find tales of heavily pregnant women contorting themselves to shave everything to be kind of depressing.)  I usually go months there, but do sometimes bow to societal pressure.

I'm generally a live-and-let-live type in regard to body hair, but I'll admit to being pissed my ex-husband's live-in girlfriend pestered my 12-year-old into shaving her armpits.
