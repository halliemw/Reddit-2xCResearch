It's like anti-passive aggressive. It's just really really funny and makes her look kinda stupid. I've also threatened to braid my arm pit hair if I have fuzzy pits that day and she comments or crack jokes about growing my own leg warmers to be frugal. Just laugh it off and she has no power over you.
