I loved my after baby body but carrying an extra 12 pounds wasn't good for me and I didn't love my tummy. So I got fit and lost the weight and now I love my body even more. Now I'm one hot, fit and healthy mama and that's what's best for me and my family. There's nothing wrong with wanting to improve yourself in a healthy way.
