Look, this isn't what you want to hear, but it sounds like he wants a lot more out of this relationship than you are able to give. It hurts, he's your friend and you love him, but you are incapable of meeting his needs (physical intimacy, a desire for children) and he can't meet yours (platonic partnership) and in the long run this hurts both of you. Clinging to this because you don't want to be lonely isn't healthy, you'll just end up lonely in the relationship.

As for the refusing the change, well, you shouldn't have to. These aren't small issues, they're large deal-barkers. If you do "change" for him on these topics all you're doing is compromising yourself for the sake of a relationship, and that's just silly.

Continue the no-contact order, it will be easier on yourself if you do. In the meantime, maybe consider starting some activities that will get you out and interacting with people? I honestly don't know much about asexuality and finding the type of person that fits your needs, but I firmly believe there is someone out there for everyone. Start by expanding your circle of friends so that you don't feel obligated to stay in a relationship out of the fear of loneliness and then work from there.
