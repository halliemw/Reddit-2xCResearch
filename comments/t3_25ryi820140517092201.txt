I know a lot of people here may be upset about not hiring a transwoman for the role, and a lot of other people on youtube think its just a disasater and a bad influence on children, etc.

but. guys. This is SPIDERMAN. Andrew Garfield is huge, he just hosted SNL and he's effing SPIDERMAN. Having an actor who is playing a superhero in this role changes the conversation in a really positive way. It would be a different effect if an unknown trans actor played this role. As it is, we have one of the biggest names in hollywood right now making a very public support alongside arcade fire. At least, that's how I feel about it.
