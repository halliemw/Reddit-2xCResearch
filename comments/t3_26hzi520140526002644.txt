I've talked to my campus police and a District Attorney that I know and stun guns and tasers are legal where I live without permits. I wasn't really sure of the difference between a stun gun and taser though; I've only recently started doing research. Does concealed carry mean guns? If so, I don't think I'd get a gun. They kind of scare the crap out of me! Thanks for the input!
