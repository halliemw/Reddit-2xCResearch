My mom passed away in February just 20 days before my wedding. Today was my first mothers day without her and it was harder than I ever thought it would be. I'm 25 and I got to spend many important moments with her but my sister is only 8 years old and she'll never have that joy. There's no dad to help so it's not going to be easy to give her that parental guidance as she gets older. My aunt and uncle have taken charge and I know they'll do a good job with her. How did you cope with it at such a young age? How can I help her through this?
