It has come to my attention that there are two types of Scotsmen. 

True Scotsmen wear kilts, and use claymores to fight. 

Actually I take that back, there are no true Scotsmen. Wait, I think there is some type of logical fallacy of this sort, can't remember what it is called.  

I will continue calling myself an egalitarian. I have never met an egalitarian who could use egalitarian arguments to justify inequality to any group of people.
