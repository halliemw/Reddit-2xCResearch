Teach her that she can be whatever she wants to be. Don't even being gender into it :) one of the most disheartening things I heard as a kid was my dad saying "Wouldn't you rather this in pink?", "don't you want to learn to sew instead of <fun activity>", and he never stood up for me when my woodworking teacher treated me like garbage and wouldn't let me touch the tools ):


My Mum on the other hand was a complete badass. She and my father were divorced and when I lived with her and my older sisters on the farm, I learnt how to be self sufficient. There was no "Let's wait for a man", there was only what we had to do. Her support made me think I could do anything :)



The other thing I'd suggest is to treat women in a respectful and kind way (I'm assuming you already do, it's a bit of a no brainer). Show your daughter how a woman should be treated by treating those in her life with respect and kindness. If she sees that's the norm, she'll expect others to treat her that way as she grows older.
