But if he really feels that if she gets the abortion he cannot be with her, he is doing the right thing in being honest. He isn't being manipulative, he is stating his valid feelings. Obviously they should've had this conversation again after they had it the first time two years ago once they got more serious but they didn't. If in his heart he believes he couldn't be with a woman who aborted their child (his thoughts and feelings) that is valid. I don't agree with them, but I think any reason can be valid for a break up, especially one this serious.
