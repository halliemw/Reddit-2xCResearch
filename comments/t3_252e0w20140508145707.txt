OP seems to be talking about scenes in the books depicting it being a "shitty product of rape culture", not a specific scene. The article that was linked mentions that as well.

> it will create an issue later on because in the book one of the women who was raped later falls in love with her rapist.

It's a story. Bad shit will happen, bad shit has always happened in this series. I dont know why everyone is okay with the murder and incest but a woman falling in love with a rapist is too far. I don't think women need to be put on a pedestal in media.
