Early pregnancy can be so difficult.  I usually feel like the life has been sucked out of me.  The constant throwing up and exhaustion are hard for others to understand sometimes.  It will get better.  My husband never understands or helps and I have no choice but to take care of our other children.  I says feel so guilty for not being the best mom.  

What helps me is marking 16 weeks on the calendar and knowing I will feel a bit better by then.  Focusing on each day and just getting through it helps too.  I also try to push the birth fear back.  I have eight children and more fear with each one because I KNOW how much it's going to hurt.  At times I feel like a walking time bomb.  It's inevitable though, like death, and worrying about that which we can't stop doesn't improve life.  Focus on the baby.  Hang a few newborn pic of your first and imagine holding another little one whenever you feel afraid.  It hard, but worth it.
