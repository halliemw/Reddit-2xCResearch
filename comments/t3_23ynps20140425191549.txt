This is so sweet!

Reminds me of my experience teaching sex ed last year, to 8th graders. I made a point of using gender neutral pronouns when speaking about relationships (specifically violence) and told the students as much because I, well, I don't discriminate. The students so easily followed my lead and didn't giggle at the idea of same-sex relationships.

I know this is only tangentially related but good kids do exist and many of them are growing up to be accepting of the differences between people.
