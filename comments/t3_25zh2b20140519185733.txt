I would just be as supportive as you can be. You can ask him if he needs to open up to you but he has to be the one that makes that decision to discuss it when he is comfortable. Just let him know that you care about him and that if he ever needs someone to talk to that you can be there to listen to anything that is hard to talk about---or you can help him find a counselor to talk to if he for some reason wants to get it out but not to you.
