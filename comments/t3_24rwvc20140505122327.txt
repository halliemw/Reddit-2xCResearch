Of course not. If you were close friends with someone for decades but then suddenly wanted to abandon the friendship and it was for a petty reason, there might be some argument in favor of not doing that. But if it's someone you just recently met and aren't even close to, there's no reason whatsoever why you should feel any obligation to be friends with them.
