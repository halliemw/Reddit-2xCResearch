This isn't girl-specific, but I think one of the biggest things you can do to have an impact on your child is to read aloud to them every night. My mom read the entire Narnia and Little House on the Prairie series to my sister and I when we were little, and spending that time together, relaxed and happy, was a very positive experience for me.
