Personally, you guys lost my trust when you did this without asking us - the community who supposedly has control over the direction of the subreddit? I've read your replies on how you were supposed to keep it hush hush and didn't have much time etc etc. You know what? I don't care. You should have said no if you couldn't ask us first. You don't get to do this and then claim this subreddit is "in the hands of the community." And you don't get to ask us to trust you.
