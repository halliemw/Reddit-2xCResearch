I would personally recommend buying reusable pads --they're made of cotton, so they "breathe" very easily, and it should be pretty easy to wash the blood out with plain water with very little stain left behind. (Even if it's been sitting for multiple hours.) Additionally, many reusable pad producers also offer small drawstring bags to store unwashed pads in if you don't have time to wash them yet.
