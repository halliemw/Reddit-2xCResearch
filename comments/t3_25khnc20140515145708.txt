I'll agree that in public sector work you find a lot more minorities and women. I've worked for public schools systems, where women are part of infrastructure teams and I've worked for the Department of Defense, where minorities and women are part of the team. 

The corporate world is noticeably different though... I currently work at a Fortune 100 company. On a floor of about 200 people and there is literally only a smattering of women and a few minorities. Go down to the developers floor and it is H1Bs as far as the eye can see. 

I, like yourself, have noticed a complete lack of women applying for the jobs we do open. We've had an open position for a few months now and there have been zero resumes from women in my inbox. They're screened prior to me receiving them though so maybe they're applying and not making it to my inbox for a variety of reasons.
