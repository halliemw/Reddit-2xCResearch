Don't 'force' her to have affection for people. 

How often do you see people force their children to hug or kiss a family member. "Jordan! Go kiss your Grandma goodbye!" Jordan doesn't want to, and parent says "Go give them a hug and kiss goodbye, right now!"

In my opinion, this isn't healthy. If your child doesn't want to show affection to someone, don't force them to. It may be part of the reason why women grow up to think or feel bad about turning down advances.
