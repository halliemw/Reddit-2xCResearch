Please go to a doctor and ask them to check if you have PCOS -- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (if you haven't already).

30% of women go through the same stuff and it's caused by growths on the ovaries and causes things like hair growth, acne and painful or irregular periods through the hormonal imbalance. It can (I stress 'can', it's not definite) affect fertility as well. Women with PCOS also at a higher risk of developing diabetes.
