I remember having the realization half way through my freshman year that my giant, state school, "research" institution could not care less about me. They are a corporation and I was a customer right up until I enrolled. Then they didn't have to woo me anymore.

It's abundantly clear as I prepare for commencement this weekend how few fucks this university actually gives. Our ceremony is outside, but in case of rain it is just canceled. No back up venue. My family, including my grandparents, are driving 13 hours to be here! I've worked four years for this moment, as did my classmates, some of whom worked even harder and longer. At best, the university is being completely flippant at worst, they are writing off my entire class as not worth their time because none of us have potential for giant donations in the future.
