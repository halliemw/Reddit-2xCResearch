I don't think this is okay.  Call yourself a sex-positive woman if you want to, but I think slut is lost to us forever in terms of "reclaiming" it because a large portion of the world won't accept it as being "reclaimed," and will continue using it in a derogatory fashion.  

I feel like the only people who will support the change are a) women who want to reclaim the word to feel like they're making a dent in the patriarchy and liberating themselves, and b) men who are all for a woman calling herself a "slut" because they're thinking they might be able to get laid by her.  

But while the word "slut" might not be hurting you, it's hurting someone else, somewhere else.  That's not right.  And it would be insensitive to those girls who can't escape its derogatory sting to just say "forget how traumatic it's been in the past, adopt this liberal outlook and reclaim the word!"
