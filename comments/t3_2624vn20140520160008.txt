Ugh, I see examples of this all the time, especially in classical music. It really pisses me off. Not only is appearance largely irrelevant in the field, losing weight can actually hurt a singer. Their body is their instrument. Sometimes extra weight is an important part of it. Not to mention that losing weight can require a tremendous amount of time and energy for some people. I don't think it is fair to expect singers to exercise a couple hours a day and diet when they already lead very busy lives. People are kidding themselves if they think all fat people get fat by eating cake all the time and once they stop eating too much they'll just magically get slimmer.
