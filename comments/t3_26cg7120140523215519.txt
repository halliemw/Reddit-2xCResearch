I think it's important to consider the involvement of police as well.  The reason being is that if he lives in a group home or similar situation, it's absolutely important that they know as well and if he doesn't (such as highly functioning enough to live alone and just have a caretaker to help with different tasks) then the police/courts can determine if he can be held responsible for his actions and if he isn't, put orders in place for supervision/etc. to prevent it from happening again.  If you aren't up to it, don't feel like you could go through a trial, couldn't stand the emotional roller coaster of it, don't harm your own well being by doing so.  

Quick story time, someone I know was molested, abused and raped by one of their parents for years when growing up.  As soon as they were able, they move out and started a new life, leaving their parents and siblings behind.  Within a year, one sibling got married and was expecting their first child.  My friend immediately reported it to prevent the same thing from happening.  Their parent didn't serve jail time due to a plea bargain, instead had 10 years probation, put on the sex offenders registry and wasn't allowed to be alone with anyone under the age of 18.  While the sentence is nothing compared to the severity of the crime, family now all knew about it (and it wasn't just one person making a claim) and others of the public knew as well.  It was one of the most selfless acts I've ever seen, saving 6 (and counting, from different siblings) children from potentially having their childhood stripped away by that person.

You don't have to be that person, but for each (potentially) serial offender, it only takes one.
