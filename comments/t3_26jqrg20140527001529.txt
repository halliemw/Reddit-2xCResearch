Hi! Congratulations, my sister is going into high school next year too! (Y'all are growing up way too fast, btw.) I have a couple of points of... *ahem*..."wisdom" which you may or may not wish to review. I'm going to divide it up into academic advice and general life advice.


Academically: Learn good study habits. Seriously. Even if you don't need to study, that won't always be true on down the line. Good habits include 

-Taking neat, organized notes.

-Reading over the notes you take when you get home everyday. (This doesn't take nearly as long as you think it will)

-Reading your textbook cover to cover. if you read a section or two each day, in between classes, this isn't as monumental a task as you might think.

-Learn a new language. Even if it isn't offered at your school. Seriously, pick a country you wanna visit someday, go to the website cafemocha (or some  other free language learning site) and start doing the lessons in your spare time. I picked Japanese and I currently live in Japan. Did I know that's what I was gonna do when I was 14? No, I just knew I liked anime and I liked the Japanese voices better than the English voices, but it's a skill that has been very handy.

-Start rigorously studying for tests three days before they happen.

-If your teacher gives you a syllabus, TAPE THAT THING TO THE FRONT OF YOUR BINDER. Don't lose it! Treat it like the word of God and check it every day to make sure you don't have something coming up.

-Participate in extra curricular activities. I was in one service based club, some academic teams, and I did choir and dance which was fun for me. If you apply to college, these things will give you a more well-rounded resume.

-Don't keep loose papers in your backpack.

-Always bring materials you need for class. Notebook, textbook, pencil.

-DON'T be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help. Seriously. Especially the teacher. My ass was SAVED many times by sucking up my pride and telling the teacher after class that I was completely lost and I didn't know where to begin. They are 99% of the time happy to help and respect you for asking. Ask your friends too, if they are willing to help. And if anyone asks you for help in a subject you're good at, DO IT. Teaching is the best way to learn.

Now, as for more life advice for high school. The most important thing to remember, during tough times, is that HIGH SCHOOL IS NOT FOREVER. It is such a small part of your life. It seems so important, and everything that is happening feels real and forever, but it's not. I'm 24, graduated 7 years ago, and I talk to maybe three, four people from high school. Of course, some people keep many more friends than that, and I sometimes check people out over Facebook, but my point is I'm not bound to those people. What they thought of me back then, what they think of me now, doesn't matter. It doesn't affect my life in any way.

Another thing to remember is to stay grounded. Be chill, especially with your parents. Sometimes it's hard to remember when you're dealing with adults that they were once your age. I was sure that my parents didn't take me seriously all the time because they didn't understand me, or because they thought I was still a child and they couldn't see that I was growing up. Looking back, even though I'm still young, I realize it's because I WAS still a child. I had a lot of growing up to do, and I thought I understood a lot more than I did. I think back to some things I said, some things I did, some things I WORE, and I cringe internally. You will make decisions, right now, that your future self will hate you for, or at least will be embarrassed remembering. That's OK. We *all* have those moments. But when you're so angry at your mom for grounding you, or when your teachers don't understand, try to keep in mind that you have the capacity to be wrong, and this might be one of those times.

My brother spent much of his high school life being embarrassed by my mom, not for any particular reason, just for being around. My sister is the same way. She dreads being seen with my mom. My mother doesn't do anything embarrassing, I guess they just worry what everyone else will think. Protip: no one thinks about you as much as you think about yourself. So don't worry so much. No one really cares what you do with your life.

Don't spread rumors. Don't make fun of people. Don't bully people. If you see your friends doing this. Don't laugh, don't look interested. Don't reward the behavior with a response. If you see bullying, speak up. Be kind to people who are bullied, or who have problems. Be kind to EVERYONE. If someone is mean to you, act bored, or unimpressed. Don't respond. Don't react. If you accidentally do something embarrassing, roll your eyes and make fun of yourself a bit. If others see that you don't care what they think, they'll be responsive to that attitude. They can't take advantage of your embarrassment if you can't be embarrassed. 

Make sure you have an adult you can trust if something happens to you. Hopefully that's your parents. If it's not, make it a friend's parent or a relative. Try not to make it a teacher, not because teachers don't care about you, they do, but teachers have a protocol they have to follow, and schools have agendas they will push, so make this adult confidante someone who has no motives except your safety and happiness. 

Don't put too much personal information online. On social media, always be positive. In fact in life, always be positive in public. Don't air dirty laundry where everyone can see. Keep your life private.


Watch adventure time, 30 rock, Parks and recreation, and doctor who. They are all fantastic shows.


I'm sorry for making this so long. If you have any questions or concerns you can pm me. And this sub is generally very supportive. I hope you have a fantastic upcoming year!
