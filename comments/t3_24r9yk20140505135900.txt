>  Too many times I've seen people complain about how romance dies when you feel like you have to ask for permission to make a move.

Well it's only romantic if he can read my mind and know exactly what I want. That's how I know he loves me right? 

I hate this whole idea that sex is always supposed to be super romantic anyway. Sex can be fun and playful or lazy or any number of things, we don't live in a movie.
