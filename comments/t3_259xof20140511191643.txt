Hi! I don't have a lot to add except that you are definitely not alone. I moved to a different part of the country last year where I knew no one but my boyfriend. I made a couple of friends who are hard to pin down and make social plans 1:1 with so I mostly piggyback on my (very social) bf's plans. I don't really have any work friends as my colleagues are largely 40's or older with families (nothing wrong with that, we simply have very different interests/lifestyles as a rule). What complicates my situation is a crippling social anxiety that's keeping me from making new friends easily. Bumping into a neighbour etc in the street sends me into paroxysms of fear, and seeing someone socially is crazy difficult, especially if it's 1:1. 

I guess if I had any advice, it would be: don't rule anything out as a way to make friends. Even things you don't expect to be fun, and people you don't necessarily think you'll get on with, can turn out to be a hoot. 

Sorry I can't be more help, but if you ever want to vent on a faraway internet randomer, you know where to find me!
