With work, you can do that. Why not get into weightlifting and learn it slowly? It'll take time and work, but just about everything does when you seek improvement. 

Honestly, your body is just doing what is natural. It's not working against you. Your body is not malicious. *you* might not want children, but don't hate your body over something so trivial as slightly different plans. I don't want kids either (not in a 'not now' sort of thing... In a 'never ever will I want to bear children' way), but hey, I'm just careful. I got a paragard iud and one day I'm going to get my tubes tied. Why hate my body or gender over something so natural? Not genders have to worry about fertility and how it ties into their plans for the future.

I hope I don't sound rude, but I feel as if your comment can be be construed as bitterly sexist. Not all men are patriarchal. Not all women aren't sexist. And womanly things doesn't have to be skirts and bodies (even though that's what's being commented).  Sometimes it can be easy to generalize and become bitter, but if you take steps closer and look at people as individuals, you'll find sexism isn't as rampant as you believe it to be
