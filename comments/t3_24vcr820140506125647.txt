Oh goodness I totally get you. I'm still young, 19, 5 feet tall. I can't find clothes that fit because I also have a very curvy body - 41" hips with a 27" waist. I have to have all my pants tailored, because it is literally impossible to find pants that fit me. Same for skirts and dresses.

I also have a very high-pitched voice. On the phone, people mistake me for my 9-year-old sister all the time. Face to face, that means that many people think I'm like 15. I get carded all the time, especially in nightclubs, and the bouncers act suspicious even when I show them my ID.

My boyfriend and I get stared at quite a bit when out together. He's 18, but looks way older (mid-20's). People think he's an older guy taking advantage of me, when in reality we're the same age. We have a kid together... stares get 10x worse when we go out with her.

The country I live in isn't even tall. Average height for a woman is about 5'4. I see lots of tall people around (in my therapy group, everybody's at least 5 inches taller than me!) but also plenty of short people too! Somehow I look younger than the rest.
