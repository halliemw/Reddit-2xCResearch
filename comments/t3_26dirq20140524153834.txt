I agree and I think it's fairly obvious that men and women have different lived experiences.  There are myriad factors that create that difference and phrases like this can be one of them.  

Having said that, I question the benefit of becoming offended at a phrase like this.  It seems to me that if you want to be treated as equal then demanding that people alter their (already harmless) choice of words whenever there's an possibility for you to twist them into something negative is not really in line with equality.  

There are "women in music"  and there are "men in music".  These are simple facts.  I think that if you raise a stink about something like this you're doing more to further the division between genders than you are to unifying them in equality since you're basically ensuring that "men as default" never dies by unnecessarily policing the language of others.
