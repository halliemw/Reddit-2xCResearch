I work in a male dominated industry. You have to assume people will treat you like an equal until they don't.   If you make yourself different from the outset then you can't be surprised if people treat you differently.  

Also don't be a wilting flower. If someone says something then call them on it and let it go. The phrase "don't be such a jerk grandpa" got me out of more than one possibly contentious situation with a co-worker.
