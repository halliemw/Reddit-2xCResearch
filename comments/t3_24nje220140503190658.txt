Does she eat a lot of soy products? I've seen some studies about [Xenoestrogens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenoestrogen) and their [impact on early puberty](http://search.nih.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=nih&query=xenoestrogens&commit.x=-1019&commit.y=-70&commit=Search). This section of a wikipedia article, that outlines the drop in age of the onset of [puberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty#Variations), is pretty interesting too.

Edit: I'm not trying to blame this on soy, there are other things like leptin levels and insulin-like growth factor that also play a role in early puberty.

EDIT: Please know that I'm not trying to scare you, and always, always consult with a doctor on these matters, but there is also something called [Precocious puberty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocious_puberty). It may be caused by a variety of things from environmental factors to pituitary tumors, which I find unlikely, (1/9) but thought you should know about.
