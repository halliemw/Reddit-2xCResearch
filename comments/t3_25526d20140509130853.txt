Oh lord. I almost NEVER mention I'm a woman unless I'm in the company of other women (Both the Guilds I'm in on WoW are primarily female populated). I was stalked for a while when playing FFXI by someone I thought was a friend. He harassed me online for months, I would block him and he'd just make another account and resume harassment. 

"Why wont you talk to me?! If you don't talk to me I'll kill myself" was his favorite threat to me. I canceled my account and went off line for a while and while I was away he eventually disappeared.

All of this because I told him I had a boyfriend IRL and didn't see him in that sort of way.
