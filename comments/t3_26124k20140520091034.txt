Okay, I am not a medical professional, but the following is what I learned while I was trying to get pregnant. 
First, I got my first positive at ten days post ovulation/conception.  Here is a list of pregnancy tests by sensitivity: http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/compare.html.  Obviously, the more sensitive the earlier you can know.  I'm not good at waiting either. 

Second, based only on what I know about my cycle, immediately after your period is an unlikely time to conceive.  Generally you don't ovulate right after you finish your period.  Sperm can live 3-5 days so it's not impossible, just unlikely.
