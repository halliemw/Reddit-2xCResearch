So do any of you care that males in comic books are equally as sexualized?

I mean yes, males are usually drawn more to emphasize huge beefcakey torsos, rugged jawlines, incredibly ripped biceps, but it's all there just the same. Hell, I've seen some artists draw wheelchair-bound Professor-X with more musculature than a linebacker.

About the only "shock" value here is drawing male characters with thin, feminine torsos, showing off their flexibility, and inevitably made to look gay.

So I'm not sure where the objection is, unless you think it's immoral to market sex to teens, since thats what the main target audience is. If so, good luck with that.
