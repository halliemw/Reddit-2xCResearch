No worries. I know everyone is different, but for me my routine went from doing (and paying for) all the same things as you, to JUST needing D-Mannose. It's also the only thing I've ever tried that works not just as a preventative, but will actually stop a developing infection in its tracks, not just slow it down until I can get to a doctor for antibiotics. I was at my wits' end before I found it. Good luck!
