But think about it.  This is a female-centered sub. This is where we talk about periods, birth control, pregnancies, where we come for support and kind words, where we post articles that wouldn't get posted elsewhere even on a chilly day in hell because they're about women and our issues.  I and many other women can tell you how difficult it is to be a woman on the internet.  This is a place for us where we can hang out and not get sent dick pics for having an opinion.  
I'm all for guys getting our perspective, but that's not what's gonna happen.  A bunch of guys are going to come in and participate, some will have a good perspective and opinions, and some will troll and be shitty but it won't be female centered anymore.  And then what's the point?  A lot of the old users will move on and it will turn into the usual shit show that defaults become.  We didn't have any say in that.  At least that's why I don't like it.
