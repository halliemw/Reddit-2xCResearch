Sorry this took so long. Nothing I say or any evidence will change your mind, you choose to label this as misogyny first. Misogyny is the projection of his insanity, the scapegoat for his actions. He shot men first also (first in fact) so he must hate them as well. Women were his excuse, his canvas, but the extreme mental disconnect was there anyway. 

Think how odd he really must have been. He was good looking, fit, drove a BMW, had money, was connected to the Hollywood inside, was in Santa Barbara. Awkward or not if this idiot could not get laid by someone there, he had to be so off as to repel women of lesser standards. There are many people of both sexes who would drop trousers for half of what this kid had, without a second thought. So his creepy factor must have been extreme to say the least. He was as fucking nuts as they come. 

Save your energies for the real misogyny, that is where you can do some good. He is not a rapist or a normal murderer he is a psychotic mass murderer. And I will allow him no more of my time, it is way too valuable to waste on this crazy fucktard.
