A month ago I came back from a 9-week internship in England, and because of it and another full-time internship, I haven't had any income since mid-december. I graduated last Friday, and my classmates wanted to have a graduation ball. My little brother is getting married tomorrow. I had nothing to wear for any of the two occasions.

I usually shop second-hand anyway. I put on some unhealthy weight while I was abroad, and dress-shopping was never great in the first place, but I managed to find a sleeveless dress that looked good on me and that I felt comfortable in. Which is a feat in itself.

I wore it last Saturday at the ball and was complimented on it. I'm really not the type to wear skirts and dresses, but one of my classmates said that it really felt like me and not odd at all. So I'm excited to wear it again tomorrow :)
