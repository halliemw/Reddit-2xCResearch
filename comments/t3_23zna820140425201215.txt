Wowsers, go girls!

As a female mathy myself I will say that it can be very hard to find study groups as a female, especially as a white female in an asian dominated major. Finding good study groups is key to being able to figure out the cryptic homework and abstract topics of upper level courses. Therefore I conclude that females who graduate with math and engineering degrees are not only great at math, but also have great people skills.
