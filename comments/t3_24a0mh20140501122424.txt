Yikes!  I had a couple of "bad" nurses when having my kids.  Fortunately, most of them were/are very nice and professional.  But it is scary.  I have a friend who's nurse and did some teaching for medical assistants and nurses.  There were a lot that I wouldn't want coming at me with a flu shot, never mind life or death medication or treatment.
