My work sells t-shirts and we've spent over a month getting photographs of women and men of various sizes trying on t-shirts and hoodies to help our customers get a better idea of how things will fit on their build. It's something similar to what Aerie is doing, and that's awesome more companies are starting to market to bodies at all sizes.
