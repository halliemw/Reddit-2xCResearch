I hit puberty really young, having to wear a bra in grade two, and starting my period in grade 3 (9 years old). Kinda sounds like what is happening to her. Please, have someone give her the menstruation talk. My parents didn't, and the school didn't do it until until grade 6 in our school so when my period came I was totally unprepared. Of course it started at school, and confused I asked other girls in my class what to do. Everyone acted like I was dying, so I called home sick. My mother was furious for being called out of work for a kid who clearly wasn't ill. At home I eventually confided in my mom, who gushed about 'growing up' but you know what would have been great? Being told that Niagra falls could sprout from my crotch at any time. I hadn't the faintest idea that this could happen.
Another big thing is not just preparing her for what's to happen, but to prepare her for how things change around her. I know it's not desirable but the reality is that once you start developing physically, the world treats you differently. Boys I hung out with would behave strange (hello hormones), and I honestly thought it was my fault. My body matured but I was still very immature and didn't understand why people thought I was older, or that I was expected to care about things I hadn't before (boys, makeup, clothes). I found the whole ordeal very bizarre because no one would b upfront with me about it.
