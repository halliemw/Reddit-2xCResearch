This isn't necessarily science related, but I wish that I knew the importance of learning how to learn when I was going through school.  I always thought that the material I was learning in school had little to no applicability to real life (which is true, mostly). Something I learned later in life that I believe is invaluable is that it is not necessarily the material you learn, but the ability to learn the material and use the resources around you to maximize your capabilities that is important.

I'm not sure how you could teach that to a bunch of 6th and 7th graders, but that information made school easier to get through for me.  Good luck!
