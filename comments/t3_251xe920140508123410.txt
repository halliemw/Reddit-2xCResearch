You can even use the new baby as a reasoning point with him. Tell him that every couple needs to examine their relationship before a baby is added to the mix. He will probably understand that you don't want to have loud, scary fights in front of a child. You can also tell him that seeing a counselor will help reduce your stress, and that stress hormones do affect the baby. 

As for the arguments, make sure that you use "I" statements instead of "you" statements (as in, "I need you to help me clean the kitchen" instead of "You don't do enough around the house." You may have heard of this technique before, but it's a really simple way to keep people from feeling attacked in an argument. 

Another is "mirroring." Before you fire back a response in an argument or heated discussion, say, "This is what I'm hearing you say," and then let him clarify if you misunderstood or misconstrued what he was saying. Your counselor might suggest a similar technique.
