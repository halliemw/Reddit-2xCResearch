I'm in awe of you for reporting it.  You've done more than I was able to do.  I was thirteen when I was raped in a very similar manner.  Before I realized I'd been drugged, bits and pieces of the evening came back to me over time.  I thought I'd blocked it out like you hear about on TV shows.  It wasn't until years later that I realized I'd been drugged.  

You may not have gotten justice yet, but the report is out there.  If he does it again and she reports it, there will be two.  That's good.  I hope you find peace.
