Given the article says "but police say the number might be closer to 100" (no quote or source, so take witha  grain of salt) I feel like they probably had him on a half dozen rapes, and made a plea deal to get him to admit to the rest at a drastic reduced sentence to give the remaining families some sense of closure and to make the community feel safe via closing a bunch of open rape cases that might never have been settled otherwise due to a lack of evidence.

At least that is what years of watching Law & Order: SVU has warped my mind to want to believe. I have very little law knowledge, so of course, feel free to correct me in my potential ignorance.
