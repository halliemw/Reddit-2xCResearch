Im on this brand of birth control and ive had no side effects what so ever. My doctor told me that people who claim to gain weight while on birth control simply arent watching what they eat anymore. Ive had no problems or change during sex, and my drive is as high as ever. My boobs never grew during the first month, and my period only lasts 3 days and before used to last 6. 
You dont have anything to be worried about, its completely safe and easy to use. And its easy to stop taking it if you do notice any changes to your body that you arent comfortable with.
