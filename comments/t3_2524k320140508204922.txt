I agree.  Let me jut add, about 40% of Reddittors are female, and we certainly didn't have 40% of users subscribed to this sub before it became a default.  While becoming a default will certainly expose us to more trolls and ignorant teenagers, it will also expose many women and girls to this community for the first time, and hopefully that will be helpful to many of them... even if the overall quality drops from what the tiny pre-default subscriber base was used to.
