The drug abuse is a symptom of the problem he is experiencing; personally speaking, I went through the same thing myself because I had my self esteem crushed throughout my entire experience in the hell I call public school.

If you don't mind my asking, which class of drugs was he abusing? Opiates, psychedelics, stimulants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, etc?
