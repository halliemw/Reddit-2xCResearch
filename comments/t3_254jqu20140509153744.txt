Hey ladies!  Stop posting cat pics.  Or pics of your lifetime accomplishments.  Or pics of yourselves.  There's plenty of other places to post those, so stop doing all the stuff you love doing on the subreddit you like using cuz this loser doesn't wanna see a picture of a cat that belongs to a lady.  

He's a prime example of a big 'ol wet blanket.
