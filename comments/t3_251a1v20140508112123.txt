Can I just say as someone from the UK what is the current minimum wage in America? 

Because I just worked out that at $10.10 per hour at 40 hours per week (just a general amount based on another comment). That would still only be $21000 dollars. Which is equal to about Â£12000. 

How do people actually survive on that with a family?
