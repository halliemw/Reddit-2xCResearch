its part of the victim culture that has been catching on for the last decade. a lot of people want to present themselves as victims because they get attention for it. as a culture we need to stop giving victims extra attention because it just encourages more people to try and be victims or to portray themselves as victims. instead of being extra nice to the next person who tells you they are the victim of this or that, you should just tell them to get help, its not like there is a lack of institutions out there waiting to capitalize off of a victim narrative.
