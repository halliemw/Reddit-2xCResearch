(Edited)The recommended first gyno appointment is usually either 1) after you become sexually active, or 2) around age 20. I left mine really late -- I was 26 when I got my first one! -- and I actually had some abnormal tissue that required a biopsy. So maybe the next year or so is a good time; better safe than sorry, and all that. If you have completely regular periods, no abnormalities or such, you can wait a bit if you want to, but don't leave it as late as I did. And if you think you're interested in becoming sexually active at college, get a birth control prescription *before* you need it. Plus, bonus, you can still get the Gardisil vaccine since you're still sexually inactive! 

Good luck with college!
