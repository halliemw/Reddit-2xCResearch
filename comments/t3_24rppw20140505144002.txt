As someone who grew up in an atmosphere similar to this one, I can tell you that "of their own free will" is not the same thing when it is actually *optional* as it is when the case is that if they don't do it, they will be side-eyed and whispered and gossiped about as potential sluts. Or when they have been taught that their only value as a future wife is an unused vagina, and if they let someone use it before marriage, they are *garbage* and worthless as a marriage partner, and also it's their fault even if they were pressured because "it's the girl's job to say no", not the boy's job to restrain himself. And do these groups put the same emphasis on boys remaining "pure"? In my experience, *fuck* no they do not, because boys aren't viewed as things to be owned and used by the opposite sex like girls are. 

There's a world of difference between teaching your kids that in your opinion it's better to wait sex for marriage because that's what God intended for both sexes, versus teaching *only* your daughters that they'd better not let a boy use their vagina before they're married or they'll be disgusting whores that no man will ever want. Because that is the heavily implied message that those girls receive. Know how I know? It was the message **I** received even though *my* parents didn't participate in these things, because I still spent enough time hearing these messages from outside sources.
