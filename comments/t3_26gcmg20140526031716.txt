There is one clinic that does abortion services yes, but there is another PP in the metro Detroit area not that far that offers contraception. It's not that far away, about 20 minutes though it varies with traffic of course and I'm not sure how long it would take by bus. But either way, I'm just pointing out there is another planned parenthood that could be accessed.
