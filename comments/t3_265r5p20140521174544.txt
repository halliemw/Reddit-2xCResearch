I met him somewhere that was like a barbershop that charged cheap prices for cuts (back when I was only cutting). He honored those prices when I followed him to another salon. So now he is cutting and coloring for $85. It's $102 with tip.

I've been thinking of trying another stylist to see if there's a difference, but wanted to see if everyone just thought this was normal before I did. He's become a friend as well as my stylist, and I don't want to go elsewhere if I'm expecting something that's not realistic.
