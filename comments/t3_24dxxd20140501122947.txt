Ok I work in health insurance. A lot of times pelvic floor physical therapy is considered biofeedback, which is sometimes a plan exclusion. Also along the lines of Viagra, at least with the plans I work with, they are covered but they have severe limitations, such as you have to have history of prostate cancer or something along those lines. A lot of plans also exclude things related to "sexual dysfunction", which include things from Viagra and penis pumps to testosterone injections. I'm probably not helping you and I'm sorry for that, but maybe try double checking your insurance exclusions and see if biofeedback is on there. You definitely have the right to appeal, and I would definitely recommend doing that. If you need any help feel free to PM me, I've worked in health insurance for almost 3 years now so I know a lot.
