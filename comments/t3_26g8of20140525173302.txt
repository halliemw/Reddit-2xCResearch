Bear in my mind that this is an opinion piece, not news, it's in the 'blogs' section of NS's website. It's intended to be thought provoking.

I don't see the issue of misogyny as being beside the point, and nor it seems did Elliot Rodger. These are explicitly misogynistic statements, as clear as it ever gets:

>All I ever wanted was to love women, and in turn to be loved by them back. Their behaviour toward me has only earned my hatred and rightfully so!

>There is something very twisted and wrong with the way their [women's] brains are wired. They think like beasts, and in truth, they are beasts. Women are incapable of having morals or thinking rationally. They are completely controlled by their depraved emotions and vile sexual impulses.

>There is no creature more evil and depraved than the human female.

>Women are like a plague. They donâ€™t deserve to have any rights. Their wickedness must be contained in order [to] prevent future generations from falling to degeneracy. Women are vicious, evil, barbaric animals, and they need to be treated as such.
