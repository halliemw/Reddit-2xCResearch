Unfortunately that's where you missed the point because you didn't read the article :)

From the article:

> “My goal was to get them sexually active on a low dose birth control pill that we knew they would get pregnant on. How do you do that? You give them a low dose birth control pill that, in order to provide any level of protection, has to be taken accurately at the same time every single day. And you know and I know, there’s not a teen in the world who does everything the same time every day.”
> 
> Everett said that a girl on the pill who thought she was ‘safe’ typically had sex more frequently than those not on the pill.
> 
> “That pill did not work, and we could accomplish our goal of 3-5 abortions between the ages of 13 and 18,” she said.
