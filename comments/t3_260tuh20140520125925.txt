> I do wonder if maybe I'm generally more 'romantic' than 'sexual' since I know I like the idea of being in a relationship and the more emotional aspects more than the sexual ones.

I'm [heteroromantic asexual](http://www.asexuality.org/wiki/index.php?title=Heteroromantic) and that pretty much sums up how I feel. haha.
