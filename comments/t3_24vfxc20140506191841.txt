YES! I was never much for the manscaping. My hubby of over 15 years has lots of chest hair, even back hair. I love the former and don't really care about the latter. 

Then again, I will say I thought I'd hate it when he shaved his head, and it didn't take long at all to get used to it. Now, I actually like it a lot. He's now basically in year 7 of bald-by-choice. So, I suppose if he want's to try it, does it make that much of a difference? Just remind him, it takes a LOT of maintenance, because stubble definitely looks weird.
