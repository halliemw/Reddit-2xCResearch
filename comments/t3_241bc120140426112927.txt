EDIT: OP is in CT so my input is no longer applicable!

And FYI, the reasoning behind asking marital status is because a young married woman is more likely to get pregnant and ask for time off of work to raise kids. As unfair as that is, it was probably the line of thought behind asking. Women are also more likely to pick up and leave to follow their husband to his job. (I don't agree with these things but that might offer insight into why they would ask).
