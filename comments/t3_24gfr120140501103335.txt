That's the part that struck me the most, aside from the total bumbling through his entire "apology" spiel.  
The language he uses doesn't ingratiate me to his point of view, at all.  
I've never heard the phrase "putting my mouth on (someone)". Is this supposed to be similar to "putting (someone) on blast" aka badmouthing them? If so, it carries about as much weight as "my bad" does in place of "I'm sorry" for me, which is pretty much none.  
Replacing difficult but meaningful words with colloquialisms simply makes it easier for people with no remorse to spit out "apologies" and explanations they'd otherwise never give without pressure to rescue their image.
