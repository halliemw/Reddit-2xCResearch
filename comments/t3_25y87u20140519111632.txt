Since you see other new additions to the office getting on just fine, what do you see which might cause you to be considered different?  I see you have "utah" in your username, so I wonder if that means you work in an office composed of LDS ladies while you yourself might not be?  I'm from Utah, so I know first hand there is a definite challenge making friends at work if you aren't mormon.

If you have moved to a different city not in Utah, you will need to make an effort to find what you have in common with different individuals in your office. Once you have things in common with a few people, the others should warm up. But you have to make a concerted effort, which can be hard!
