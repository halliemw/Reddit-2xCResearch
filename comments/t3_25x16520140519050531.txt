Yeah, you know, it's weird. I always just thought I just felt more comfortable around guys because of having brothers and some traditionally male interests, but then I realized that it wasn't just that- I am actually quite terrified of other women..I always feel sooo anxious around them, and like  they are out to get me, I am suspicious of them and very jumpy and nervous...and I also have a lot of anger towards other girls left over from high-school. I admit it. I am still very resentful, and pretty traumatized about how I was treated by my so called "girlfriends" then, and I have been too angry and afraid to really give female friendships a real try since...thank you
