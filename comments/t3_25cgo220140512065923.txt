I am so happy to have so many wonderful people around me who support me through hard times and celebrate my achievements with me.
 And the rest of the day will be spent at home, watching GoT and knitting.

Context: Passed my doctorate test and got "good luck" text in the morning and lots of congratulations & happy hugs afterwards.
