This is totally normal. Don't worry, it'll get better.  The advice in the other comments are pretty spot on.  I'm sorry people were rude to you when you came here for support.   The reddit community can be so rude sometimes. But I hope you know that it's not a reflection on you. It's really cool that you were brave enough to post this because I'm  sure so many women are going to read it and feel so much better that they aren't alone in this experience!
