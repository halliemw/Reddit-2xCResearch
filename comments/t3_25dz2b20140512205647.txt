Someone told me I had beautiful teeth at work yesterday. A dude who's apparently 16 asked to marry me today and when I called him out for asking while I'm working and how weird that is he was quick to bring his age up.

Again at work, a dude asked if my name tag had my phone number. I replied "I'm not THAT desperate!"
