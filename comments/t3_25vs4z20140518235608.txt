I'm glad that it sounds like you have started to make peace with things. 

I just wanted to point out that even though some people do have a hard time with pregnancy and childbirth, that's not always the way it is. Everyone is different and there are many women who have uneventful pregnancies and don't find childbirth horrible. 

If it was horrible for everyone, nobody would ever have more than one kid. 

When you do get pregnant, I would suggest talking honestly with your ob/gyn about being scared of the pain and talk about what your options are for pain relief. 
I think sometimes women are made to feel guilty about things like wanting pain medication and epidurals. If you need something like an epidural, it's not something to feel bad about. Do what you have to do. 
I know that I personally would never attempt a natural childbirth without pain medication. If other people find that works for them, good for them, but I don't want to go through that.
