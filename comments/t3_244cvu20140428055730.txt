Yeah, some people like to just have a period maybe once every 3 months when it suits them, so it's a bit more predictable rather than spotting out of nowhere. I supposed it gives you a sense of normalcy. I wish I was one of the 20% who stop getting periods on Implanon but instead my cycle goes: bleed for a week, get 3 days break, bleed for another week, wait 4-5 weeks, repeat.
