I could have very well written this post myself. The only main difference is that I'm single. A lot of good advice has already been given. 

I will say that I've had the most success with Meetup. It is true though that you have to find the right group, so don't get discouraged if you go to one and don't feel like it works. If you live in an area where meetup is pretty active, try another group or several. If there isn't one, you can try starting one yourself. (I know finances are tight, but it is something to think about in the future.)

The closest friends I've made since moving here 3 years ago have since moved on. It's been extremely hard for me to find people like them. The loneliness and wanting to do things with people these past couple of months have been at an all time high. (Apparently, I can't motivate myself to go out do stuff on my own and tend to spend time just sitting on the couch netflixing. =/)

Anyways, I want to wish you the best of luck! We'll figure it out and make it work somehow. =)
