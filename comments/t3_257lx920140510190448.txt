I bought my MoonCup from a UK site about 7 years ago or so. I'm in the USA btw. 

I suggest searching this forum for the myriad threads on menstrual cups. I also third the suggestion of the LiveJournal community devoted to cups. 

Google menstrual cup sizes to see how they compare. I chose the MoonCup UK because it's shorter than the Diva Cup and slightly smaller. It fits me best.
