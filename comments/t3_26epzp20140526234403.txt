I kind of hate labels of any sort. 

The last time I made it clear I was a woman and a feminist, I suddenly became the stereotypical "feminazi" (which was odd; it was the first time I'd even heard the term, and the definition I was gifted with was downright appalling). I'd just like to say I'm a woman who supports equal rights for everyone, and has respect towards other individuals in my day-to-day dealings with them. 

I also don't like the rants over atheist-antitheist-etc... that go on, when the simple truth is I don't believe in a personal god, nor an impersonal one, either. 

I don't need to nitpick or cherrypick labels; all they do is mean different things to different people, and the only way to sort it out is to have an actual, person-to-person conversation.

I guess that's why I'm not a big joiner of causes; I'll support the individual actions that mean something but not wholesale lend my support just because someone wants me to. After all, change only makes a real difference at the personal level. Lots and lots of little changes can combine to make movements, but those are messy by nature.
