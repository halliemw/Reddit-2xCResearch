I assume you mean again? 

You told him that this was a dealbreaker for you, and he did it anyway. I'm not sure why a second chance is warranted to be honest. 

Despite that, if you do decide to forgive and move on, you have to actually forgive and move on - this cannot remain a point of contention or resentment will breed like crazy. If you are going to bring this up anytime he doesn't something "off", then don't keep him with you.
