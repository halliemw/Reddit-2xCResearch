"Some of the responses make me genuinely feel useless, stupid, and maybe I should kill myself."

This is terrible for you! Whether you join this sub or not, I would hope you can develop a stronger sense of yourself as a survivor so these asshats and their asshat behaviors don't cost you so much. I know that's easier said than done, but it is possible.

One thing this sub can definitely do is help people see who is to blame for inappropriate behavior - and it is NOT the victim! There is a real possibility for empowerment here.

Sometimes I wish 2X had a "bathroom wall" onto which all such nasty PMs could be posted for everyone to see. Preferably on the front page.
