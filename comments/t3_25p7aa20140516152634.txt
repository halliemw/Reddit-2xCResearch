It's pretty damn clear that you were being rude. Being blunt but respectful would be something like, "Honestly, you should stop complaining about downvotes because it won't get you very far on here. Go to another subreddit that will accept your opinions and stop wasting your time."

But you said:

 > How about you stop whining about meaningless down votes you've received for voicing unpopular opinions. Maybe you should be spending your time at conservareddit.com. I'm SURE your opinions would be very popular there. 

The above was just unnecessarily rude (not to mention fallacious)


 > Is your opinion more valid than mine? :)

Yes, I do believe that my opinion is more valid than yours in this case. Sure, rude can be subjective to an extent, but some definitions are much more valid than others. I NEVER said that I think that all opinions are equal, or that I even agreed with the OP. I simply called out what was wrong with your post. Blunt can be respectful, but your definition of blunt is pretty horrible.

 > Do you honestly think I care, or that your convenient justification for your downvote means anything?

No, I honestly don't care what you think. I only said that as an example of when to use a downvote correctly.


The point of this thread was why dissenting opinion is downvoted. The OP of the post you replied to was complaining about opinions being downvoted. There is an explicit purpose for downvotes. I don't agree that all opinions are equal or that all minority opinions are necessarily valid, but I definitely think that downvotes are misused. Maybe it's an unfixable problem and the purpose of downvotes should be modified to include disagreement, but that's out of the scope of this argument. I just think that, to put it *bluntly*, your reply was poor.
