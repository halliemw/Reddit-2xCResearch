See?!  You had to put "the system" in quotes because it sounds like a conspiracy theory.  That is part of my point.  The people working in mental health are very good at what they do, on the whole, and should not be disparaged like this.  They generally work very hard for not much pay, and dedicate their careers to keeping people safe.  Also, IF the video is what was reported to police, creepy is both appropriate and understated, BUT any information we are receiving right now on that subject is most likely rushed and inaccurate.  Up to the minute news reports are no longer a great source of accurate information for backstory details, so I will withhold any further comment on what is happening in that case.
