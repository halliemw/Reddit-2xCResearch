He knew he was allergic and got the cat anyway for you. I think that's understandable, as many people in the world are a bit allergic to their pets. However, he couldn't have predicted that he would snore loudly and keep you awake for multiple nights in a row. The fact that you seem so angry at him for getting you this pet is just silly. If you're that upset that he got you the pet, then give it away. If you're not upset but want to stop the snoring, then give it away. Being mad about the past isn't going to solve your current problem.
