My roommate/best friend and I have lived together for four years and we're going through something similar.  I'm graduating college and she got a great new job in a city about an hour and a half from where we're living now.  I'm moving back to my hometown and she's obviously going to move where her job is.  It was sad to talk about, but it just really comes down to simple logic.  When your life starts to move along, you have to move (literally and figuratively) with it.  

We were sitting in our living room soon after  she got her job and I just brought it up that I wouldn't be able to stay in the city after graduating.  She agreed and said that it wouldn't make sense for her to continue making the three hour round trip every day.

When it comes down to it, it will be a simple conversation.  Don't get too in your head about it.  It's uncomfortable sometimes to deal with change, but it happens to everyone.  Of course you'll miss each other, but moving out doesn't mean the end of your friendship.   Just a new sort of friendship where you're not around each other constantly.  Hell, it may actually be better that way.   You'll still have each other, just not in such close quarters. 

Good luck, I hope it turns out well for the both of you.
