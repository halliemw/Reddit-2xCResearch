Do you mind expanding on why you sometimes just need a night with females only? It just sounds odd you judge like that solely on gender. You're telling me if there's men out there who were to fit right in with your female friends, interact the way they do, do everything like them, that just because he has a penis you wouldn't want him around sometimes?
