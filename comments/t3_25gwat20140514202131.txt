Update: I went to a counselor today. Took off work and told my manager vaguely what happened (not with whom), and I am going on a waiting list for free therapy. I also told Sean and he's keeping it to himself. We are talking about how to tell Kristen because I have no idea how to. Any ideas how to tell your closest friend something like this?
