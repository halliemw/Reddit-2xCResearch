>HA! I GET IT!!! IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A WOMEN'S SPORT!!11!

Only in the USA, I think. Perceptions are weird like that... In my country we weren't encouraged to play football in school, volleyball or handball were pushed more, because they were more developed. Too bad I sucked at all of them :) 

>Just wondering, does anyone have an idea as to how much she's paid?

Huh, it's weird that you're the first person anywhere to mention this... No, nobody in the media wrote about her salary or the length of the contract. I wonder why, usually those things are standard information.
