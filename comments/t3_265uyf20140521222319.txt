I've had my mirena for a year and one month. For the first couple weeks I had constant cramping and also ended bleeding for about a month. Not heavily, but enough that I had to use tampons. I get cramps off and on now and they are a bit more painful than when I was on the pill. For me personally, the cramps are worth not getting a period and not having to remember to take a pill everyday, but it never hurts to talk to your doctor if the cramps are unbearable.
