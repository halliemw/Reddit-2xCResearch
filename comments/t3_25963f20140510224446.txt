"Calm down" is the worse thing to say to anyone who needs to calm down. That is normal for you to feel that way. 

The best way for someone to help someone calm down is by acknowledging their feelings and showing empathy. Telling someone that they "need to calm down" is basically telling them that they are overreacting and when someone is upset they need to hear the opposite: that their feelings are valid and understandable.
