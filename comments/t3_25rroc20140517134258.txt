This is what's wrong with our society.  First of all, it's not like she had a full drawn photo of a vulva between two open legs. It's a uterus. There's nothing that should be sexual or vulgar about it.  Nobody looks at a uterus and sees it as an erotic message. It's an organ, like your stomach. America as a society has so overtly sexualized women, that apparently when they see this image at a graduation, their memories are "marred" by the grotesque image. You make the statement that children attend the event. ..Most children with the sex ed (if any) from today's schools won't even know what that is unless they're old enough to realize that there is NOTHING wrong with it. And if they do see the image and recognize it, become "marred" by it, then how shameful we have become for demonizing a normal part of the human body. There's nothing inappropriate about it unless you're oversexualizing it.  
And in regards to the anus thing, it's associated with pooping, and the majority of people find that gross. How can you compare shitting to the female reproductive system?
And breasts...same argument.  Only sexual if you're sexualizing them. If you're mentally marred by breasts, then you need a reality check.
