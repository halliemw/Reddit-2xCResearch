Oh, that sounds like a tough situation.  I'm sorry that he's unwilling.  If I were in your place I'd probably try to explain that I need him to be willing to bring things up himself, or at least try to get him to explain why he doesn't want to so that he might move past it.  Other than that I wouldn't continue.  Communication is so important.  If you fail to communicate I don't see how the relationship can succeed.
