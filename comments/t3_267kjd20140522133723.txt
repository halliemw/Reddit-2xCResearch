This is essentially my experience coming off birth control after about 9 years of use (I had the cramps from every religion's hell). Things have evened out now such that the pain is tolerable with drugs. I wasn't thrilled about my boobs shrinking, but I was thrilled about my creativity and sex drive revving way up. It took only a cycle or two before I felt a big difference - and before my acne flared up.

I tried Depo to follow up, but had terrible results. Fortunately I'm not sexually active right now, so I'm just coasting. Good luck finding the best solution for you!
