Hey.  I'm so sorry that happened.  It is not your fault.  You were assaulted by someone.  He is the disgusting one.  He found you passed out and almost puking and instead of helping you, he took advantage of you.  It is awful awful awful and 100% wrong.  

Normal reactions to finding someone passing out from drinking are grabbing you water for when you wake up, leaving you alone and shutting the door so you can sleep in quiet, putting a bucket next to you in case you have to throw up.  Climbing into bed with you and touching you when you aren't able to move or react is NOT OK.  

Listen to the advice people here are giving you about next steps.  Drinking too much does not make it ok for someone to touch you without your consent.  It is not your fault.
