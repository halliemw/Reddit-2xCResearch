I think I would report it, the law would go easy on him but if someone can't act appriopriately and puts other people in danger with their actions then they shouldn't be allowed to wander around to do so. 

He needs help, he could do it to someone younger and the only way he will get help is if the people working with him are aware of what he is doing so they can give him help.

You have every right to your feelings and don't be afraid to seek help in terms of counselling and such.
