I heavily agree with what people are saying about seeing a professional. They aren't always right, but they are schooled in this and might have a better chance to help you sort things than you would yourself. Also, if your kid is a bit much right now with everything going on, maybe see about part time help or daycare if you can afford it? Maybe you have a nearby relative who wouldn't mind watching them a day or two per week? The best thing you can do to take care of your son right now, is take care of yourself.
