When I went to Culinary School 20 yrs. ago , the class was 70% female. There were Women everywhere I worked . When I moved to Washington in 2000, I found VERY few women in the industry here. Unless you are in Fast Food , There are almost No women working in Culinary Here. Pretty much every where I have worked for the last 10 yrs. I have been the only female. It is a very frustrating dynamic.
