Yeah, I know what you mean. But I know that there have been times where my whole instinct was to break up, that I knew there was no future, etc etc but for a variety of reasons I kept the relationship going. Then it would just get harder, more drawn out, and would hurt more in the end. Stay strong, you can do it. He will be ok.
