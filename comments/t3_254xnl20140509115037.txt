Wow, I do think that's really bad. I'ved worked in restaurants (so not quite retail) for 8 years now and I would never ask a woman if she is a mother or not nor have I ever seen/heard of someone being asked. My staff would for sure be reprimanded for acting like that waitress. Generally, it's assumed that if you are out at a restaurant or at a family friendly event on mother's day that you are a mother. I live in Britain though and while Mother's Day is considered a lovely and important day by most I don't think it is a *huge* deal like it seems to be in the US.
