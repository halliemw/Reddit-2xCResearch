Good to know. I felt really similarly when I had Paragard inserted. I think I accidentally called my gyno a son of a bitch (and she's a lovely woman!). I thought I was going to vomit or pass out. Then I DID vomit at home an hour later. It was rough, but seven months later and hormone/baby-free, it was totally worth it.
