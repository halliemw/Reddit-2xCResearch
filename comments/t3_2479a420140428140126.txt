I hope that the author's conclusion is what's actually happening, but it's still so frustrating to try to have discussion on women's issues without someone hijacking the whole thing and making it about how a small percentage of men have some tangentially related issue. There was just an article posted in /r/TrueReddit about how women suffer from low confidence in job interviews and the top five or ten comments were things like "men suffer from confidence issues too!" and "sorry to not talk directly about the article, but men suffer as well". Maybe this is a step in a better direction, but it's still frustrating. I feel like most of the time, the discussion can't even get off the ground because it gets misdirected (as above) or completely minimized by men who don't want to entertain the idea that maybe there is an issue worth discussing.
