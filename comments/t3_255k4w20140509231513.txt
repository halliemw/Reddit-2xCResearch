Me toooo. I have so many teeturtle shirts (luckysaur is my favourite!) and I'm going to keep buying. Great customer service and I love the sizing guide - I had a lot of trouble figuring out my size before, and now it's really obvious looking at the L that that's what I am, even though I'd often be an M in Australia :)
