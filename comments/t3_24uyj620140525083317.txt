I didn't end up meeting with the mean lady boss. I opted instead to discuss the issue with HR. The HR rep went over lady boss's notes on my feedback with me. Which, much to my surprise, I discovered that Lady Boss had the forethought to get approved by leadership before sharing them with me. Of course everything that she covered with me was in the notes but with MUCH more context. So, for instance, while she told me I am "overly confident" her notes said that I am overly confident when it came to my ideas about making changes to the training program and that they would need to be thoroughly vetted by the organization first.

Essentially, IF she had shared her full feedback it would have been perfectly reasonable and professional. I made it clear to HR that she had not! The HR rep agreed that the feedback was poorly delivered and assured me that she would not only follow up with Lady Boss but also meet privately with all of the employees who received feedback during the most recent round of internal interviews to ensure that no one else had the same experience. (Which I know for a fact that several did). 

So, either she is absolutely terrible at giving feedback or she orchestrated the whole thing with a great deal of forethought. Which would make her some sort  of sociopath I guess, but I'm not really sure which is the case.

However, now I am more than happy to put the whole thing behind me and focus my energy in more positive ways going forward. Cheers!
