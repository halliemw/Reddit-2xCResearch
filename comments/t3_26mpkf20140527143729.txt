I know that how you feel about your body is the most important factor, but I just wanted to say that I think your nipples look pretty normal. (Straight female.) Have you checked out the [normal breasts gallery](http://www.007b.com/breast_gallery.php) - I know its cited here a lot, just in the off chance that you haven't.

I'm not entirely sure where the scars are? I would have interpreted the lines to be compression from your clothing?
