I cut my waist length hair this past saturday and donated it, and while I didn't go as short as you did, I'm a little sad that I didn't think about trying to raise money. 

I had some similar feelings -I didn't cry, and I do think it's an amazing feeling to have such short hair, but at the same time, I became acutely aware of how much of my femininity felt tied to the length of my hair. I'm not a particularly "cute" girl, I don't have pierced ears, I wear men's glasses.... sometimes it seemed like the only girly thing about me was that my hair brushed my ass, and not it a redneck metal braid sort of way. 

I guess it's just a round about way to say that I understand where you're coming from - it's hard to regret a choice that feels so good and right, but it's weird to live with the effects of that choice.
