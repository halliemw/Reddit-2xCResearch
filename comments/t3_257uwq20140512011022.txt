I don't see what is so hard to understand. You don't NEEED a suit to sit at a desk and write stuff. If you don't need it, why do you do it? Who does it benefit if people wear suits while locked in a cubicle? Does the physical act of wearing a specific thing change how good of a worker you are? Why can't we prove how well we work by simply how well we work? 

This idea of just allowing people to wear whatever they want is quite normal in many fields (for example research is EXTREMELY casual. Nobody gives a shit if you wear t shirts and skinnies. And nobody would call you sloppy for it). Same as IT. Start ups in particular are progressive by allowing workers to wear what they want, have flexible starting hours, building a strong communion feel by going out together/doing sports together, flexible and reasonable understanding of needing free days. 

And guess what - this improves production. Happy workers work better and more efficient. So not only does it make social sense (recognizing that people are not work drones but people who need to live freely) but economic sense too. 

Sure, there are a few fields where looks are integral. Customer interaction changes things. But the majority don't do face to face customer interaction. And they should not need to wear specific things.
