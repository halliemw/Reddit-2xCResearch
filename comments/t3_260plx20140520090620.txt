I had the same thing happen to me. My friend and I have been friends since high school. She was the first person I called when; I got engaged, found out I was pregnant. I admit we haven't been as close. But she stood in my wedding 2 years ago. Because I consider her to be important to me. She got engaged last year. Called me right after. Told me how excited she was to start planning and having me help. 
Then this past summer. She posts a picture to Facebook. Her bridesmaids and mom out shopping for her dress. I was heartbroken. I cried for awhile. Granted I was about a month or so postpartum, so my hormones were a bit wacky. 
She came to visit a few weeks later. And we talked about every aspect of her wedding, except bridesmaids. It was the elephant in the room. But I wasn't comfortable bringing it up. She text me when she picked up her dress. Then broke the news that she was having 2 other friends from hs, a couple from uni and sister inlaws to stand. It still hurt. But I accepted it.
I think she knew I was upset.
She called the next day and asked me to do a reading. I just wanted to be there to help and see her get ready. 


tl;dr
Friend got engaged. Never asked me either. It hurts. It sucks. But ultimately her decision, the friendship is seen differently by both. Just be happy for her.
