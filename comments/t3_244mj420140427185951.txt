I think if donation is something that you think is right for you, you should weigh the pros and cons very carefully. I didn't experience any emotional symptoms but I am only one person. You should consider looking up the side effects of the medications through rxlist.com or elsewhere. I was prescribed hCG, Follistim, and Ganirelix.
