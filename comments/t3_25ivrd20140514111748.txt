I can't decide whether to upvote this post because it brings to light this ridiculously stupid belief that men (and women too) are "owed" something in ex-relationships, especially fleeting ones. Ugh, it's both narcissistic and oblivious behavior.

Or downvote this post (not these wonderful responders) because this guy doesn't need anymore traffic to his site either inflating his overly large ego or adding fuel to his self-pity parade.

He might have been older than Emma, but he's the one acting like a five year old who just dropped his ice cream.
