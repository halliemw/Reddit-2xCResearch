All the advice here is great!


My roommate and I are great friends, and have been living together for 3.5 years. She's getting married this summer, so we'll be going our separate ways.


We've had tons of conversations about it, but I still got a little twinge when she asked for my empty amazon box to start packing... Feelings will happen, I guarantee it. But that's just evidence of the great friendship you have!
