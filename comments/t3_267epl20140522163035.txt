Post-baby bodies are still amazing, it's just that arseholes can't see that. I've got a 6 month old. What changed? Well, my fat has shifted around a little, the skin of my belly is a little loose (I had PUPPPS, which is known to cause excessive stretching), and a lot of belly stretch marks which are slowly fading back to silver. I lost all my baby weight when he was born. I'm now working on losing more because I'm overweight and don't want to be.  
  
L&D is hyped as a horrible, terrible thing. The reality is that it can be bad, or it can all go really smoothly. Knowing what happens exactly, and what you can do to help things go smooth makes a big difference. Mine ended in a C-section after I agreed to an induction for high blood pressure. Even then, it wasn't a traumatic event, because the staff were fantastic. I mourned the vaginal birth I didn't get for a while, because it *was* upsetting, but I have no regrets for agreeing to what I believe is the best thing for my son.
