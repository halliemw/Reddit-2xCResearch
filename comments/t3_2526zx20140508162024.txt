I'm sure this one comment will be lost to you in the downpour you must be getting. Also, I'm not entirely convinced you aren't trolling us all, by engaging in the exact behavior OP is talking about. But, just in case: 

You are getting downvoted because it seems like you intentionally misunderstood OP's post and carried her argument to an extreme degree so you could become self-righteously offended (strawman logical fallacy). Which, if it was intentional, is a definite example of assholery (see Rule #1). 

OP's point in making this post (even with her original wording) was never that men should not participate here; it was that newcomers, men in particular, should stop to listen and understand what's going on before jumping in to comment in a way that might be nonconstructive or potentially hurtful. If you refuse to accept this fact, then you simply cannot be reasoned with - you are arguing for argument's sake, which is what this sub seeks to avoid, and the entire reason for this post. TwoX might not be the sub for you.
