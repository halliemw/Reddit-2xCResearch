Guidelines vary a bit. Last I heard, it was every other year if you're under 30 and only getting a Pap, and every five years after 30 if you also get an HPV test. But that's in the US, and other countries have different standards, so a little googling to find your country's gynecological association's guidelines should give you a clearer idea.
