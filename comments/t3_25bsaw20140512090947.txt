I was raised religious, and though I've gotten past a lot of that I have one thing that stuck with me: if something bad happens it's because God is punishing you... so when I first became depressed I would cut myself (I.e. punish myself) to show god that I was sorry for whatever I had done. But he never took the depression away and the knowledge that my punishment was not great enough depressed me more and lead me to hurt myself worse and worse.

I find it interesting that so many people self harm but for so many different reasons.
