I don't watch it, but my mother works in the TV industry, and one of the shows she works on is UFC, so she's like... really into it now, especially when the women fight. I think that's cool, since she's otherwise this straight-laced middle aged housewife, but she'll drag my stepdad to sports bars to watch these women beat on each other. Just thought that was neat. 

I think the women in UFC are awesome and I wish I were as strong as them, but I don't like, actively watch the fights. Too brutal for me.
