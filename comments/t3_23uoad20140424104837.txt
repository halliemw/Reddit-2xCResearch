You know, that is really annoying and I like your description of gate keeping. Bt if I do meet someone who self describes as a fan of something, and then they look at me like I just ate my own boogers when I start to gush about whatever fandom, it pisses me off. If we're talking and it comes up that they based the original mask off Shatners face, and the other person responds like "wow, nerd. Why does anyone care?" Yeah, I'm gonna say you're not a real fan.
