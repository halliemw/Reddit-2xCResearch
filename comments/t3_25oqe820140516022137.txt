My high school friend's brother was accused of rape and her family made every attempt to discredit and destroy the reputation of his accuser. I knew his family and I believed them because, well, how could he possibly do such a thing? That girl obviously just wanted attention and I was disgusted that a woman would lie about that. Then one night after a couple of drinks he tried to rape me. Luckily he was drunk enough that I could fight him off and he eventually stumbled into the bathroom and slept in a puddle of his own vomit. Asshole. 

I never told because I didn't want his family, and my friend, to hate me.
