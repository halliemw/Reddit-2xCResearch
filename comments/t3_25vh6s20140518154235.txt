I'm an XY, But I posted this because of the historic significance of the occasion and not because of her accomplishment, but the change that is occurring in military posts and acceptance.   She and many other women before have been qualified and risen to the ability but we're never appointed to roles such as this.  I think she, other women, and men beofe of the greatest military ever deserve some recognition and a 'tip of the hat' for their hard work and dedication.   It's great now that we are seeing recognition of their abilities now as they are given the assignments that are right for them and they're capable of just like their male counterparts.
