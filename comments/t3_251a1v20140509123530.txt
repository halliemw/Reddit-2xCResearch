don't 401K's already grow at the rates higher than inflation?  Is there not already a massive system for this?

and doesn't social security exist?

>That's not true of the U.S. government.

I'll just... accept that then. Yep.

>No it doesn't. Only real wealth allows people to buy homes and cars.

Having the ability to buy a thing on credit or similar and pay for it over time opens up tons of opportunities for people.  A person can get a car to get a job, etc.

>If you think that crippling the poor with higher prices and debt and eating the elderly's savings away for the benefit of the banks and government are a good thing, then you'd have a point.

It wouldn't be crippling the poor if minimum wage went up to match it.

The elderly shouldn't be investing in things with lower than inflation's returns.
