I actually had a friend almost exactly like this. I don't know what to tell you, because when I told her that it really bothered me that she seemed to only think about me when we were together, she dumped me. I'm not terribly sorry. If our 20 year old relationship meant that little to her, I guess I'm better off. I miss her, but friendships can't be that one sided.
