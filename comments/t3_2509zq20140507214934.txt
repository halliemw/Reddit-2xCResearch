Honestly I think the motivation is to normalize the idea that women are on the internet and especially on reddit. For example, how many times have you seen a woman be mistaken for a man in a popular comment or post? How many times have you seen the opposite? 

The default assumption most people have is "hurr durr, there are no wimenz on the internet." Like the former Iranian leader who said that he was 100 percent sure there were no gay people in Iran.

It's similar to how lgbt people decided to come out in the 1970s despite the heavy backlash they initially faced. Exposure comes with backlash, but it also changes normative assumptions.
