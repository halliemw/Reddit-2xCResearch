I hadn't thought of it that way, as having a bad model to avoid. This will be good to think on when I feel myself getting into their patterns. I really do want to improve on those traits and I wish I could go to my parents with relationship questions and issues, but now I know I can't. That makes me sad. Other things, yes, but not this. 

Anyways, thank you for your advice and thank you for the luck! We aren't planning to get married any time soon, but it's on our schedule for the future. I just want to make sure I don't set myself up for failure in relationships. Thank you!
