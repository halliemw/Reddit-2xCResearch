I'd imagine there are victims who don't know what to do or where to turn so they go to a trusted RA or some such thing. Maybe they still care about the person and don't want them in jail for a what they see was a mistake, maybe there was drugs and/or alcohol involved and they don't want to admit to a crime, there's a million reason. It is just another system of support, another place to turn to when they need help. The idea is probably that the university has its own discipline system and will pass off what evidence they gather to the police, but universities have PR to worry about which may motivate them to dismiss more cases than they should.
