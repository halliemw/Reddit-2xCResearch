That is incorrect. If *women* found shaved legs on *men* to be a crucial part of attractiveness, men would do it to. Lots of men do find it a crucial part of attractiveness, which is why so many women shave their legs. The same is true for men shaving their faces. Sure, some women don't mind a burly beard, some even like it. But most women seem to prefer that men shave and manicure their facial hair pretty closely. Even men with beards generally don't go Duck Dynasty. Because most women find that a turn-off. 

It is an absurdity to think that one-to-one reciprocity should be the expected standard for attraction between sexes. Males and females have been evolving to seek different qualities in each other for millions of years. 


Males generally have hairy faces, while females do not. Males have deeper voices while females do not. Males are generally taller, women are generally shorter. On an evolutionary basis, women evolved to generally maintain an appearance which is closer to that of children than males. Limited body hair is a part of that trait. Men evolved to find young females attractive, women evolved to find powerful males attractive. In cultural genealogies in which either gender has significant body hair, hairless men are roughly on par with muscular, deep voiced women in the rankings of desirable evolutionary mates.
