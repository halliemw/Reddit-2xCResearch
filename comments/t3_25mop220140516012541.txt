He sounds like an anxious person, trying all the things he can to fight his fear of failure. I know this type it used to be me, the best action you can encourage is to live life in the now, there is no point regretting the past, he just has to accept it and go forward. The best thing to do is to demonstrate it yourself, get away for a while and find some place where you both can just totally relax and embrace life. A couple things that helped me overcome were eating well, reading philosophy, exercise, and yoga. It really works to calm anxiety and slow down life a little bit on a regular basis to gain perspective.
