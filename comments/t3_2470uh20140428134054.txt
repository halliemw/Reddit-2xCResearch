I have the copper IUD. I've have it for a few years now with no serious complications. I was sore after it was inserted but haven't had any problems since, other than heavier cramping when I'm on my period. Generally if I take Midol proactively it doesn't get too bad. 

[Here is some info from Planned Parenthood about IUDs](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/iud-4245.htm). You should be able to feel the strings any time you check, but if you can feel the actual device then there may be an issue with its placement.
