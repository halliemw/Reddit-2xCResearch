I understand what you are saying, however when you say forced, or despite his beliefs you are implying that their marraige isn't a partnership. By putting the individual's needs/wants ahead of the partnership you contradict the very definition of a marraige; the union of two individuals. When entering into the marriage she stated that they both shared the same belief system, if he is unaware of her change in thinking and desire for birth control, etc. how is he at fault? In order to make a marraige successful those things should be discussed, even if they are difficult.
