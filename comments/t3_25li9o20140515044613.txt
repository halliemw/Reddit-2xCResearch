From a male perspective: There's a juxtaposition in the look of some women with extremely short hair that I find very attractive. It's not that such a woman looks masculine, it's the fact that she still looks soo very feminine despite a hair length I identify as masculine. Seeing only your face, I can tell you are one of those women. No one could think of you as unfeminine no matter how short your hair was.
