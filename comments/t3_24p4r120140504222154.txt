You can do this. It's a daily challenge, even for those who are in shape. But it gets easier the longer you do it. And look, there are going to be times when you mess up - ice cream three times in one week, skipped the gym, etc. And that's fine. Just get up and keep going! I know  you can do this! It will take time and be challenging, but you totally can!
