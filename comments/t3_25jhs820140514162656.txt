being taken advantage of by older men, especially during my early teens. it happened horrifyingly frequently, and inwas always terrified to report it because my parents (mostly my mom) would blame it on me. eventually, it got to the point where the FBI had to step in because a guy had essentially groomed me and was then attempting to blackmai me into having sex with him. but of course, that was my fault even though i was 13 and he was in his 30s... *sigh*
