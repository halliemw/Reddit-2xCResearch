I'm advocating to make sure that you are seeing a certified genetic counselor. The testing options for hereditary cancer have changed drastically over the past couple years. 


Given your mother's very young age at diagnosis, possibly considering testing for a panel of a number of hereditary cancer genes (including BRCA1/2 and others) may be appropriate for you. The genetic counselor will be aware of what panels are available for you. These panels may be called myRisk, or CancerNext, as an example, and include testing for multiple genes at the same cost as testing for BRCA1/2 only. 


If you are in the US, you meet any insurance company criteria for coverage of genetic testing - that I am aware of. Also, recent laws have gone into place to make genetic testing affordable for those who have not had cancer. It may be likely that there will not be any out of pocket cost to you ($0). The genetic counselor will discuss the testing process with you and what to expect and how the results could come back. If your results are normal/negative, increased screening for breast cancer may still be appropriate for you.

Best of luck!!


Edit: Disclosure - I am a cancer genetic counselor. I see patients in clinic, and do not work for any genetic testing lab.
