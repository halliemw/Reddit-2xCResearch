>  I feel really guilty and like I let her down

No no no.  You have no reason to feel guilty.    You didn't leave her exposed out in public on the side of the road, you ensured that she was helped to her room.  On the contrary, you did not let her down - you helped her.


> if I had've taken her back by myself,

Are you expected to have picked her up and physically carry her by yourself?  You asked for help.



> if I had've stayed with her a little longer,

 What's a little longer - a few minutes, a few hours, all night? You made sure she was back in her room.  That is more than enough.



 > if I'd made sure he didn't go back, if I'd listened to my instincts, maybe it wouldn't have happened.

You are not responsible for his psychotic behavior.   Should you follow every man around the campus to make sure they don't rape someone?  I know that's an absurd example, but ultimately, you did not assault her, you helped her.  It was his decision to be low piece of scum.

  
You are not being selfish.  Someone has a horrible experience(s) (and you're there for them - a lot more than many people would do) does not mean that your needs as a person - the good and the bad/sad - should be of any less importance.
