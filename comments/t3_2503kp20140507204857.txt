It is not a baby. I am not sure why you feel that he is allowed anything, unless you are from a country where women are "forbidden" control over their own bodies?

At about 28 weeks of pregnancy the fetus becomes viable, capable of living outside the womb, though 24 weeks is possible.

It is called science. Also, we evolved from fish type things and Jesus was not around when there were dinosaurs, sorry :/
