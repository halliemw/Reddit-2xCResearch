[Studies show](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12529237) that male employers do not want female employees who behave like male employees.  

The guys get to behave like that and have it "work".  A woman tries that and every mistake will be used as "proof" of your incompetence [xkcd style](http://xkcd.com/385/).  

We don't get to make mistakes.  And thats the sorry truth of it.
