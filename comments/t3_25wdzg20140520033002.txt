sad is a pretty good word for it. like i said, the real problem is poverty. the culture is a culture of poverty those who make loyal commitments to each other and have high expectations of each other are the ones that work together and survive. nobody can afford to live for themselves alone, because if they aren't working together they all die off. this also breeds an "us vs them" mentality where people can't afford to worry about the welfare of strangers. and this in turn allows people to do terribly inhumane things to each other. 

it is sad. and it is a direct result of poverty.
