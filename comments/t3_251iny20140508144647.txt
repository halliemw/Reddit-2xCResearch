How 'bout we try

*I* had a comprehension problem. *You* don't like it. However, I read the thread twice, attempted to figure out what was going on, and had difficulty doing so. 

You are bitching at me because I asked for clarification in a thread that you found easily comprehendible and I didn't. Can we accept that just as different people have different relationships with people, they can also have different interpretations of blocks of text? 

I find it ironic that you are kind of attacking me for this. Why can't you just accept that I needed more information and let it be? No, clearly I have to be a concern troll or something. I worded my original question very politely because I didn't want to be seen as a troll or just brushing off the OP. But apparently because I had difficulty understanding her and her problems, and then asked about it, that makes me a shithead.
