I dunno-- just get a new account with a clearly female username and wait for the downvotes in most other subs. My username seems gender neutral and most people think I'm a dude. But if I use other accounts, people suddenly become a lot more argumentative and downvoty. I'm tired of it. I've almost quit reddit several times because of this. 
edit: ha ha I have downvotes now.
