Sure, that is true in general yes, but that does not change the issue here because there is an asymptote, and the asymptote is different for males and females. Basically, only a small fraction of people exposed to programming in the first place would actually want to become programmers because every individual is different and a majority of people are not *that* interested in programming. But on top of this, *both* a greater proportion of males exposed to programming and a greater proportion of males *not* exposed to programming would end up as programmers. It would be very difficult to expose *only* females to programming and not have it be exposed indirectly to males which would have a greater effect on them than on females. You could increase female interest in programming but realistically only if you increased male interest in programming even more, in which case the proportion of people interested in programming who are female would decline (but the absolute number of females and proportion of *females* who are interested in programming would increase).

So basically what I am saying is that campaigns to expose females (or anyone) to programming are great because they will either increase or tap into some interest in programming, but we should not expect the gender gap in programming to disappear or change much at all really. It might narrow by a few percentage points but that's about it. As long as every individual, male or female, feels comfortable in pursuing their career choice and in their workplace environment, I don't see why it should matter if the job itself is not split 50/50 between males and females.
