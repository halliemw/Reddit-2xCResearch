Are you able to answer these questions to yourself later? It might be good practice to do that, to prime your mind. I find that talking through why they asked the question helps me be able to answer, even if it's at home afterwards. It's made me more confident about questions that I'm not prepared for because I am able to think it through in the moment thanks to making myself think it through afterwards. Does this make sense?
