I'm not sure if my comment will have much weight, since I'm a guy, but my girlfriend has one. She doesn't like it much. She says that it's pretty gross and can be awkward changing it at work, or any public place. But, that being said, she won't ever be switching back to pads/tampons. As much as he dislikes the DivaCup, she says it it worlds above dealing with tampons.
