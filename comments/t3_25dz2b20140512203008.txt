I was 22 and was at a small local Pub in Chicago. There was a 50 or 60-something drunk dirty old man who was a regular. He usually never talked to anyone, maybe occasionally a bartender. 

One night I'm talking with a friend of mine when I see him get up and start walking towards me. Oh god no. He stumbles his way over and puts his hand on my shoulder and slurs out "if you ever need love, money, or someone to kill someone, just let me know". All I could get out was a "heh"
