I wish you didn't feel bad for him, because as awkward as this man may or may not be he purposely gave a minor alcohol to get her to be more willing for sex.

This man had this girl try on swimsuits in what I can only imagine was an attempt to get himself off. Dude is not to be pitied this sounds like the actions of a person that is a predator.

Edit: If anyone else blames the victim of this shut them up by asking "don't you have a 14 year old niece/daughter/granddaughter? Would you feel the same if something like that happened to them?" If they give you shit about how it's not the same or they wouldn't do that you just remind them that kids trust adults to behave like adults and not harm them.
