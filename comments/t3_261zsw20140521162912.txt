Male here.  I am an avid rock climber so I spend a lot of time at the rock gym.  They're usually a huge sausage fest and the guys would love to help a beginner.  At the same time, its not a typical gym where everyone is wearing headphones, which makes it easier to casually talk to people.

I've been on match and eharmony, not a fan.  Try meetup.com.  You can look for groups of people with all kinds of different interests.  I just moved to a new city and don't know anybody.  I found a rock climbing group that is doing a trip this weekend and I'm going with them.  If you're not into rock climbing you can find tons of other kinds of groups that have regular get-togethers.
