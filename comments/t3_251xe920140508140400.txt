A second opinion in the form of a counselor sounds good. (Wonder how he might react, do you intend to keep it secret?)

One small piece of advice from my own marriage -- often, a change of location can do wonders to communication. For instance, you two going out to chat in a restaurant or (alcohol-free cocktails!) bar. Closed, known spaces like home -- especially if your place isn't very roomy -- can mean you both get into negative automation and trigger each other's frustration buttons unwillingly. Good luck!
