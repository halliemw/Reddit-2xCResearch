I was mortified. I grew up with social anxiety and my parents (father, mainly) were abusive. My mom had talked to me about it briefly, but I had been so weirded out about it and didn't feel comfortable having her talk to me about that that whatever she had told me I had tried to block out immediately. 

By the time my period came around, I had forgotten about the conversation. I also didn't have friends to talk to about it or hear about periods from because I was homeschooled. My period came on the morning before an afternoon fishing trip with me, my dad, and my sister. I freaked out, didn't know what was going on, and was too anxious to ask for help. I thought I was really sick and I was afraid of "doing something wrong" or getting in trouble (again, I was abused). I tried to hide it and use toilet paper to catch the blood. I went the whole day and was extremely anxious and shaken. 

I told my mom that night, and to my horror, she got all excited. She made me tell everyone. She made me tell my dad, he was just awkward about it, and then she made me call my half-sister who was in college and tell her. I tried to push the fact that I didn't want to tell anyone but she wouldn't listen. I remember not understanding why everyone (my mom, mainly) was so excited. YAY! I get to bleed once a month for a week and feel like I'm dying and have all my clothes stained. Wtf.
