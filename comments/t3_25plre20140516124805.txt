I really like the idea of the tags.

I hope I'm wrong, but I would predict that there would be a lot more downvoting on these threads because some people on the default threads have the attitude that if someone posts on the internet, it immediately opens the OP to scrutiny.

Edit: Here's an example I just ran across. Someone posted a picture of herself in her graduation gown for IFF. When she commented saying that she got her degree in film, there were a subsequent comments that were berating her choice of study. And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25pkq8/iff_finally_after_today_ill_have_a_ba/chjtpj6) is the kind of response I'm talking about.
