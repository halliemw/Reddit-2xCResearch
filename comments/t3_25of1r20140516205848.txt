That is truly an awful thing to carry, and I am very very sorry that happened to you. I wish you were able to be free of that sense of vigilance, and that your trust in the world hadn't been so smashed apart.

That constant vigilance and feeling that you need to be careful all the time is cruel, as no amount of personal vigilance could have prevented that happening to you at four, and I'm sure you're not suggesting that children should be vigilant and live in fear of the same thing happening to them.
