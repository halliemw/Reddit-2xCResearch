Well one of the most common first signs of a first HSV outbreak would be pain along with the bumps. I personally don't have a vagina or the virus, but initial outbreaks have been described to me as feeling like a "crippling sear that puts the worst UTI imaginable to shame".

Go to the doctor. Get an STI panel, be sure to specify that you also want the herpes\HSV1&2 screen as it isn't standard issue.

Worst case? An acyclovir prescription for the rest of your life to manage viral loads. Breakouts are surprisingly manageable these days with antiviral regimens.
