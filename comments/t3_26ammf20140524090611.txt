God. Thank you. 

And also, it really bugs me when this kid is described as learning disabled. 

He's probably actually mentally disabled by his IQ score, aka retarded. But heaven forbid we should say that word.

His disability is no excuse for his actions. Plenty of people with Downs Syndrome would never sexually assault someone.  And if he continues to sexually assault women in public places he needs to be institutionalized.
