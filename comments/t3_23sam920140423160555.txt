Yeah, I'm still working with the hospital.  The thing is my $10,000 is AFTER some assistance.  It would have cost upward of $30,000.  But we're still keeping our fingers crossed that another form of financial aid will pull through.  The results have been taking forever to go through.  But yes, if I end up having to pay, I'll make sure to set up a payment plan that works with my income level.

Thanks for your support!
