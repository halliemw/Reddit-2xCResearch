I've had one of these... Maybe you can have a talk and say "hey, I enjoy when we hang out but it feels like it takes a lot for you to commit and show up...and at this point, I usually expect for plans to fall through. That doesn't feel great in terms of our friendship... and I know sometimes this can make me feel really frustrated. Is it something we can work on?" It may be something she's aware of - or not - and it may or may not be a thing she can change (or is willing to change). For me - I chose to let the friend like this stop ruining things for me... spending time waiting for her, or having her command attention on my birthday outings by calling my friends to talk about why she was late and on & on. She was late and missed my birthday brunch because she decided to stop for breakfast on the way... (Seriously.) But friendships are not always eternal - sometimes they're there for specific times and places and it's okay to appreciate them for what they were and let them go :)
