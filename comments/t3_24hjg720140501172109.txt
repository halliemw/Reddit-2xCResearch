I would suggest trying some topical acne medication, such as Stridex pads, on the area. Stridex pads are good because they have salicylic acid but don't have any alcohol, which is drying and irritating to skin. If it doesn't clear up with salicylic acid, you could try benzoyl peroxide (such as a Clearasil cream), but keep in mind that benzoyl peroxide has a bleaching effect on fabric so you have to be careful with your clothing and towels.

Also, if you don't do it already, you could try washing your underwear in hot water, which will help kill any lingering bacteria on them. People with facial acne are often recommended to do this with their pillowcases.
