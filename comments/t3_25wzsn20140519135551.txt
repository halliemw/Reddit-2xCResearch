It's so important to look out for yourself, even if making the right decision causes you pain. I've been there. 

Even though breaking up now to follow the path to a Master's would hurt, a decision to stay instead (especially when feelings of "owing" are involved) will most likely result in you being more unhappy and resenting your SO down the line. Resentment like that can kill the relationship you were trying to save.

Good luck!
