There are 'progressive' conservatives. My mom's one. I think she suspects I'm gay, I'm maybe a bit bi, and she keeps dropping non-subtle hints about how being gay is fine with her. Not like I didn't already know that. She's supportive of my aunt being gay and is the first adult that one of my friends came out to.
