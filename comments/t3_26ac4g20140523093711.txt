Everyone has a right to have a child if they want and obviously if they are fertile and have someone willing to conceive it with them, having the money to support a child given to you isn't a right but I believe good children can come from poor families so I'm more than happy for some of my taxes to go towards helping those families to stay off the streets and to have food.
