I highly recommend a massaging showerhead, if you have access to one. The kind that has the hand-held head is best, because you can use it in any position. It's a big enough stream that you can stimulate the whole vulva, and most of those shower heads have various settings so you can adjust the intensity. (Maybe that's not what the settings were originally intended for, but what the hey.) 


Not that you should go change your house's shower head, but if you ever happen to be in a hotel with one...give it a try!
