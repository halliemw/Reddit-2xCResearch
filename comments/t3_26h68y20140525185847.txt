I wish I had answers for you. I'm in a similar situation regarding my BFF who is in the process of planning a wedding with someone who's showing red flags. One example is when she talks to me, she's all gung-ho about putting her foot down about pre-marital counseling because they completely disagree on several key issues and 2 days later, she says he laughed at her and forcing him to go would be "disrespectful" to his feelings despite the fact he laughed at hers.

Ultimately, there's nothing I can do except make sure she knows she can come to me anytime and smile when she tells me something off the wall. My friendship with her and her knowing I'm always there to help is worth more than driving her away with criticisms and further into the wrong person's arms.

Sorry you're going through this, OP. Hope this new guy treats her better.
