She's been into biking much longer. I'm just starting, my goal is to start bike commuting to work everyday. We just started going, but so far the other volunteers have been very nice and laid bike. I pretty sure I only get one free bike, but we'll still continue to volunteer. Some of the bikes they repair they'll sell to people for a donation.
