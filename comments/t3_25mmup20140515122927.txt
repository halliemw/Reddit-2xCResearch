Sometimes this is the only way survivors can find justice for what happened to them. The evidence required for a student conduct hearing is significantly lower than a criminal case. It is the survivor's choice of whether they want to go through the criminal system.  It can be very traumatizing and lead to nothing in most cases.  

I am not defending Columbia by any means.  They are clearly not working in the framework of a victim centered approach, as is the recommendation by the [White House report on college sexual assault](https://www.notalone.gov/) that was released recently.  However, it is totally within the scope of university student conduct offices to deal with these issues.  They go through significant training and there are constant discussions on college campuses to make them a safer place for students.
