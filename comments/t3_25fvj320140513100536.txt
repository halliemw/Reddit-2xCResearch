It comes down to taking things in in measured doses. I sit here and cry in response to some posts, or want to help, console, give support, etc. Sometimes I leave some words of support or encouragement. But if it gets a bit overwhelming, I go do something else. 

It helps to have friends who are similar in that regard, as we can have our little inside jokes about how 'sappy' we are, crying at songs or videos on the internet, or even articles showing people in sad times, happy times, even cute things. So if you don't have any similarly empathetic friends, you should try to meet some.

Other times, you just need to know when to disengage and recharge your own batteries. For me, sometimes this is taking a walk, exercising, or engaging in a hobby.
