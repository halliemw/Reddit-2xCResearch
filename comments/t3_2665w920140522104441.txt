I think that romanticizing of mental illness as described in the article is merely another manifestation of the fantasy of being rescued. I recall being 13 about 30 years ago and having some messed up fantasies that now make me cringe. I had one in which a man would abuse me and then be remorseful - talk about sick (it's even more cringe worthy if I tell you which 80s pop star it was, and I'm way too embarrassed!) It was always the same story underneath though- rescued by a man. That may be the root of this thing that should be driven out and burned- the idea that being a weak victim is somehow romantic. As a much older human it occurs to me that to want to be a helpless victim is undermining all the autonomy I also want and to want to be rescued places a burden on the guy to be a "hero" - when really, my logical brain just wants us (the startlingly normal, non-abusive, nice guy I married and the startlingly average and not weak woman I am ) to love each other, look out for both of our interests, and hang out and have a good time.

Teen aged me had some really stinky shit swimming around in my head.
