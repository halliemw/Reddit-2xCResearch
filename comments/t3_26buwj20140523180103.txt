Okay, I'd suggest going to a doctor and seeing if they'll recommend you for therapy on the NHS. I'm currently with [IAPT](http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/) and we're doing CBT, which I find really helpful - it's very practical, and you can do it over the phone or in person. The counselling service just might not be right for you, and I do think that there is some form of therapy out there that you could benefit from. CBT is very good at addressing negative thoughts that you hold about yourself, which is something that - judging from this post - could be an issue from you. I hope this is helpful!
