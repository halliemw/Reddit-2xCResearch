coming from masturbation and 'coming' from sex are different for me in particular, and I'm just sharing, not wanting advice or the like. But for masturbation, darn, do I know. 

For sex. Darn. Do I know. But the first few times it happened my body reacted differently, so I just thought that I almost got there. Turns out I got there two or three times. 

For me, in sex, it was gorgeous pleasure mixed with the odd "I'm done" feeling and then everything just melting. If that makes sense to anyone out there.
