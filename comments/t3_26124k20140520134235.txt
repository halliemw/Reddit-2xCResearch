Just so you know, I WANT to be pregnant and I've been tricking myself into seeing pregnancy symptoms everywhere for the past 3 months. And I've had sex a ton of times since I stopped BC.

Did you know that healthy, fertile couples only have a 30% chance of falling pregnant each month, even if they are having sex 3 times a week?

Try not to worry! You probably aren't pregnant.
