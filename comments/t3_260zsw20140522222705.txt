Thanks for sending along these links!

It's a struggle to find much out there about theist-atheist relationships. Even in all of my googling and searching, most of what I found has been regarding Interfaith relationships (the advice, counseling, resources, etc available all seem to target this demographic). And I've found it frustrating. 

At least interfaith relationships can relate, although on different terms - both parties still believe something. The minister in the book you mentioned says that her faith grew stronger by seeing her partner's faith. Doubtful it'd be the same if her partner had no faith whatsoever. 

It's like two people with two different sets of rules, vs two people where one has rules and the other has none at all.

Thanks again for the links!
