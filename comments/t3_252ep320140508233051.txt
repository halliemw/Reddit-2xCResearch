You may actually find the Diva Cup easier, it is firmer and not as inclined to wiggle and wobble about. 

My suggestion would be to test it out with some lube ahead of time if you get one, to see what insertion technique works the best for you! Depending on your body and how bad your cramps are, this may be a way to see how it'll sit when your cramps ease - mine tends to sit a lot lower towards the end of my period than at the beginning.
