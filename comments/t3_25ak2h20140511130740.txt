I do and I don't need the child support. I'm pretty poor right now, but I live with my boyfriend, and he makes good money. We're not married so we still split bills and have separate accounts etc. We also plan to get married, but we are not in any sort of a rush. I don't like to do it, but if a huge financial crisis were to come up, my boyfriend would not think twice about helping me both emotionally and financially. I don't really run the risk of being "left out in the street". 

That being said, I've learned to live without child support, because in three years, the ONLY time he ever paid was the first month. I realize I could get him arrested, and if the state decides to track him down and do it, I don't care. Still, I don't feel like actively trying to get him arrested. In jail, out of jail, either way I don't get child support from him, and would bet a lot of money (that I don't have) that he will never pay child support. I'm not going to actively go out of my way to get him arrested, because his inmate status literally has no effect on my life at all. I don't even care enough about him to hate him. 

I'm also very close to getting my master's degree and, if all goes to plan, should be making good money within the next year, so I feel like I am close to being able to live comfortably without relying on anyone else's money. 

EDIT: Still, I'm not quite "there" yet.
