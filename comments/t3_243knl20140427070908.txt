Hi! I have the same issue! Online dating is definitely not for me. It doesn't help I live in a small town. I am so joining this post because I hope to learn some new things to make friends.

When I lived in the city I used to live in a hostel so I made so many friends that way. Also through uni, one friend I made, made it his personal mission to help me meet heaps of people. Small town life is not for me, at least at the moment!
