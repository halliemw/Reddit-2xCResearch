>  I think just finally admitting to myself that this is a real thing that happened to me is hitting me hard

I know what you're saying.  For years, I lived in complete oblivion of what had happened to me as a child.  It was only after I was raped (already as an adult) that it all came back to me in forms of flashbacks (literary like in repeated scenes of different movies in which I was one of the characters, but  just extremely real, and as if it were all happening at that moment), and in a series of absolutely inexplicable panic attacks.  


Even years after the flashbacks started I either didn't understand what was happening (thought I was losing my mind) or was not able to admit to myself what they were about.  Then, after I could not deny what was happening anymore, I convinced myself that I must have deserved or provoked it.  So, I just want to tell you this, because that's what I wish someone had told me when my journey started:  Be kind to yourself, go easy on yourself, don't be afraid to ask and seek help, and the most important thing to keep in mind at all times is that none of what happened was your fault.  It didn't happen because of anything you did, or didn't do, and there was nothing you could have done to stop it from happening.  Also, like I said before, it does get better.
