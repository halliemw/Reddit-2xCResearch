I think you're right to be annoyed - I'm 5'2'' and love going to concerts, so keeping myself out of flailing elbows way is something I have to do a lot. I always let my group know if I want to mosh or not, so everyone is clear from the start whether or not I'm going in.

Definitely have a chat to them, though - they need to know that you weren't cool with what happened, or they won't know for next time.
