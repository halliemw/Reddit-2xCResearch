I think that is a bit harsh Stoner. I agree with you however that it doesn't seem like the OP is doing much physical presence support. But maybe the friend doesn't want it? It's not the OP's situational problem so the OP shouldn't have to commit their life to this issue. 

I strongly agree that texts and messages are a cop out. She shouldn't be alone. And alone includes being around people who do not know the situation. Is she working? Is she functioning at work if she does? 

She definitely needs some non male physical presence/support. I've been there I know what it's like. And talking to someone via text is just not enough.
