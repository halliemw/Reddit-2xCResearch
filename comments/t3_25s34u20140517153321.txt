Looking back, yes, I honestly wish I had reported and documented EVERYTHING including all of his attempts to contact me and tell me not to tell anyone. 

However, the second I got back home I showered four times. I felt so, so dirty and ashamed. I sat in my apartment and sobbed for three days and contemplated suicide but I was too depressed to get out of bed and actually do it. 

When I finally started pulling myself together and going to the doctor and told my family and my psychiatrist, I just wanted to get as far away from the situation as possible. I got a new phone and number, deleted my facebook, cut my hair and started trying to live as much of a new life as possible. It was only until recently that I really started to allow myself to process the fact that I am still the same girl and this is something I need to deal with.
