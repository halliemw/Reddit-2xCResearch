I spent a bunch of time in the front/pit at concerts from say 14-25 or so. Some crowds were great. Some contained people who thought it was a great opportunity to grab my ass or touch my boobs. I wasn't even surfing, just *present*. Girls who did surf often got it worse. But due to the chaos, it was often not possible to tell who did what and it was just so fast and sudden, which apparently made some people feel like it was a license to touch girls and women with impunity.

It's sad, but I'm glad she's speaking out about it.
