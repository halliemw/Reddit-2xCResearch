Mental illness shouldn't be used as a catch all to 'other' people whose actions scare us. One in 4 Americans lives with a mental illness; 1 in 4 Americans have not internalized misogyny to the extent that they think all women are sluts who deserve to be punished for denying men the sex they're entitled to.  

It's easier to say 'mental illness' and wash your hands of it than to admit maybe we're all a little bit complicit in the kind of society and culture that created this monster.
