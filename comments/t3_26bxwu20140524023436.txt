Agreed - I think it's symbolic, at some point. To harassers on the street, you are a walking sex object - for most of them, that means your only worth is the vagina they assume you have. You can't leave their perception of you at home, and neither can I.

(What I'm trying to say is that the harassment you face as a woman is the same as mine, and that it stems from your being perceived as a sex object. Although, you likely also face other forms of harassment for being trans).
