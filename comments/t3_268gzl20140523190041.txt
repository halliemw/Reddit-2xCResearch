I'm on Merina, and have been for almost two years. My skin is no worse than it was, I think I have actually had less PMS (but I also started taking antidepressants at the same time, so that may have helped).

I still get cramps, but they last a few hours (instead of the prior day and a half). I still get periods, but they are much lighter and I have one "heavy"-ish day (in that I actually need to use pads or tampons, or menstrual cup) and then I spot for a week, and spotting is such a non-event that I have forgotten that I am technically still bleeding and should use a liner so I don't stain my underwear. My cycle and period length haven't changed.

I did get a cyst, it was painful while it formed and when it "popped". But it was gone within a month. But I did need to cut back and not do acrobatics for a little while when the cyst was large enough that I was risking ovarian torsion. 

I think it is totally worth it. I use to have really heavy, long, crampy periods and spend two days curled up with a heating pad, taking lots of advil and then still bleed for 10 days. I wasn't going to risk having a longer or heavier period.

The cyst was the only negative side effect I have experienced since insertion.
