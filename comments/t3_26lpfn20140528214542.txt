Thank you! Getting a dog is definitely a big commitment, financially and otherwise! I live in a small apartment too, so I made sure to get a small dog (mine weighs about 16 pounds now that he's fattened up from the shelter). At least in my apartment complex, that cuts down on the pet rent (smaller dogs are cheaper). He also requires very little food and is minimally destructive because of his size. Honestly, I always saw myself with a bigger dog, but having a smaller dog is so much more practical for my lifestyle. And I love my little guy to pieces :)
