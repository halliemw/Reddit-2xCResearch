Well, it's called "honeymoon cystitis" for a reason, but you're right, it's no cause for worry (I didn't know about the peeing after sex thing so of course I got it).  

The reason isn't really related only to hygiene - the two of you have slightly different bacteria and now the bacteria are going to become one, to put it euphemistically.  In the meantime, one's immune system may not be able to cope and cystitis results.
