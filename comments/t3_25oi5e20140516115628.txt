Thank you for your insight! 

And thank you for the book recommendations. I was at the bookstore and thought about getting one from the self-help section, but there were so many choices, it was overwhelming. I'll look into Gottman books then! 

I saw a counselor while I was in college since it was free, but now that I've graduated, I don't have a counselor anymore. I'm going to graduate school, so hopefully they'll offer something similar because having a counselor really did help me work through the muck of my emotions and experiences! 

I'm going to talk to the boyfriend about it, although I'm sort of embarrassed about it... I feel like his family doesn't have these kinds of issues and opening up about it feels like I'm admitting my family can be a real mess, although I love them deeply. Anyways, thank you!
