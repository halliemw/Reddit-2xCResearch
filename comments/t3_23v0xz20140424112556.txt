> The guy might have had the best of intentions and been a totally cool dude

no, no he wasn't. you know what normal, totally cool people don't do? go up to people they don't know who are 30 years younger than them and try to pressure them into accepting lunch dates. it's normal to offer career advice and networking to people you *know* or through alum or professional groups. pretty, young girls alone in a parking lot are not appropriate mentoring targets.

this guy is old enough to know that what he was doing wasn't ok. and what he was doing was hitting on a girl way too young for him, in a way that completely ignores boundaries.
