From the article:

>Back in 1990, students at Brown University also scrawled the names of alleged rapists on a bathroom wall. That controversy helped spur the university to update some of its policies related to sexual harassment, but also resulted in several individuals at the university being falsely accused.

Seems to me like a good portion of the "information" likely isn't entirely true. So you've got a list with a handful of people who *may* be guilty of something, and a bunch of people who *aren't guilty of anything*. How does this help? And more importantly, how is it fair to the people who did nothing wrong?
