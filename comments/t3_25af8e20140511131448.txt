Over here. I sent my stepmom a card and cupcakes since I'm 1000 miles from home, but I haven't sent my biological mother anything in years. She lost the title of mom ages ago.

"Mom" isn't a given just because a woman gave birth; it's a relationship to be fulfilled and expanded upon over the shared lifetimes of a older woman and children, related or not. And today is just a Hallmark holiday that caters to the majority.

Carry on like it's any other Sunday. :)
