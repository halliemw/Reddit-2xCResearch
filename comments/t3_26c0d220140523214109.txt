It is molestation even if the one who did it cannot be charged due to their age and may morally not even be able to be held responsible.  It could very well have resulted from a girl who was just beginning to experiment sexually who had a very poor understanding of personal space, and thus may not be able to be held at fault, but it doesn't change what happened to OP.
