You mention your current state of health in your post. Are you stressed out? Is there a lot going on right now? When I was 18 I was preparing for college and holy cow is that stressful. Stress can definitely affect your period, it affects your whole body.

Another thing: are you eating properly? Are you getting enough calories and vitamins? This can also affect your period.
