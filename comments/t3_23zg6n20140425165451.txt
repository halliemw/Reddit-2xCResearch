Well, I have a lot of single guy friends. I actually didn't notice the lack of single ladies until a guy friend asked me if I knew any single ladies. He's having trouble finding someone who wants a real relationship, rather than just a hookup. I know way more guys than ladies, and I don't know where they are. It's weird.
