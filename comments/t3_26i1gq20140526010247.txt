Always report these things, always.  I can't stress this enough.  It is probably nothing, just a bunch of kids making a very unfunny joke like you said, but keeping campus security extra careful is never a bad idea, specially in light of what just happened in California.  Everything will be ok, I just wish there were more people who did this. Always go with your gut instinct when it comes to being safe and always report posts about violence in schools even if they look like obvious jokes. There is nothing funny about that.  If you overreacted you can always apologize and that's the campus security's job anyways.  Take some deep breaths, you're safe and you did the right thing.
