I can understand why it's useful as a member of a group that faces discrimination to deny discrimination exists. It means you can never be accused of blaming others, never be accused of whining. It makes you look tough, and stoic. It can be a useful attitude.

But it's still nonsense, as evidenced by the links in the article.

Accepting that the hurdles one faces are higher than the hurdles others face doesn't necessarily mean refusing to run. It could serve as motivation to try all the harder. And I don't understand why an observer, seeing that the hurdles are higher for one runner, would think that runner to be inferior.
