It's like magic, if a woman uses the same intonation and words as a man, she is tagged as "bossy" and he is tagged "authoritative."  We have [studies](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/education/women_science_medicine/_pdfs/HOPKINS-Unconscious_Bias-01-11-12_7final.pdf).  So, no, it's not because women use different words or speak differently.  It's because women are *perceived* differently.
