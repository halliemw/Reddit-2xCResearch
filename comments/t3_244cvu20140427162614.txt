I've read it's not medically necessary to have a period. If your birth control pill didn't have you take a break with those five placebos, you'd never have one and it wouldn't build up or be detrimental. 

I believe my gyno also confirmed this and so assumed it was more widely known, but pharma and larger population hadn't caught on yet. 

What have you all read/heard about this? 

And if that's the case, why do you think so many birth control methods still require the period? (pill, patch, shot)

(Bonus comment: I was on a low hormone pill for a couple years and only ever had occasional spotting instead of a period. This was considered normal and acceptable by my doctor.)
