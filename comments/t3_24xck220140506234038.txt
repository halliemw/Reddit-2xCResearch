I'm gunna take a crack at this because I think it's a really good conversation you're bringing up here and I'd like to keep an eye on where it's going. It seems to me that if you're pro-choice then you are at the same time, pro-life for people who choose to be pro-life. We have had many very positive conversations on here where women shared stories about how an unexpected pregnancy changed their lives for the better and I never saw anybody say that that wasn't right and they should have had an abortion. If someone were to come on here and declare that they are pro-life but made it very clear that they were only referring to what they would do given an unexpected pregnancy of their own, I would really be surprised if they got shit on for that. Even in that case, I would personally consider that person to be pro-choice in the political sense. I have never seen someone come on here and declare themselves to be "pro-life" in the sense that they morally disagree with abortion. At the very least I would have to commend them on their bravery if they did! 

tl;dr pro-choice can accommodate pro-life, I have yet to see the reverse
