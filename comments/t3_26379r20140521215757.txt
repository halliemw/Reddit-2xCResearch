That is the problem. It is not always that someone is complementing because they think that the woman wants  to look European, but it is because she is black that she is beautiful.  I think black women are stunning, because they are black. Not despite being black, and I think often times these comments are misconstrued as the first. 

It is well known that black women are invisible in the media. 
So society is trying to make a conscious shift to make it known that black women are beautiful and they don't want them to feel invisible. Just like any civil rights movement, it is going to be awkward and slow and in small steps. But criticizing it from the getgo is going to make it halt altogether. 

But I also always see comments like yours all the time that basically sums up: " no white girl has a right to complain" is also counter-effective. Being discriminated against in the beauty category is not  strictly a black woman's category. And no, it doesn't stop at middle school. 

I personally suffer from rosacea, which is hereditary condition making a bright red face. It lowers self esteem, self confidence, causing sufferers to avoid social interaction. 

Right now I am watching this horrendous ad campaign from a prescription company for rosacea that is literally called rediswrong.com.

If that isn't offensive, I don't know what is. 

So no, black women don't corner the society picks on me market.
