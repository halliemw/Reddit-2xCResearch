holy fuck that is a gorgeous fish.  

I keep a salt aquarium and I've never seen one like that in all my researching on fish.

Where in Cali did you find this little one? Far out snorkeling or relatively close in? I'm going to Cali sometime this year and I'd love to go actual see what it is I'm imitating with my tank.
