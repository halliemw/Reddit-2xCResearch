Did you know you can get a vasectomy at Planned Parenthood?

But yes, like everyone is suggesting, it would be very nice for men to have a form of birth control
 available to them other than a vasectomy or various condoms. I really dislike the nonverbal agreement that people expect women to be on a form of BC,  and I dislike how BC affects women in so many ways. I don't know if my normal is really normal, as I've been on the same BC for eight years. Just a thought.
