I wanted to be a stay at home dad. The woman that decided that I would be a good mate wanted to be a stay at home mom. Her body, her rules. I  focused on working to support a family.

The men are not expecting anything (well, the good ones anyway), but they do have the right, as human beings, to have desires and dreams of their own, and to try and find a way to make them come true. If a man wants to have kids when he's in his 30's, and not farm out the raising of them to a day care then one of the parents gets to stay home and raise them. To this end it is entirely within his rights as a human being to seek out a woman that wants the same thing he does. Either one of them can stay home and raise the kids, or they can shunt the kids off to daycare and both go back to work (I couldn't do this myself, but many feel comfortable doing this).

I was making a very generalized statement in regards to how men react to a relationship situation within the bounds of the broadest view of modern western social structures.
