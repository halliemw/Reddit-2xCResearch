I always got dolls for Christmas.  Nice ones, often with outfits which Mom handmade with love.  And tea sets and books.  But I wanted Matchbox cars.  Nope, little girls did not play with cars.  I was thrilled the year my brother got me a Creepy-Crawler Thingmaker.  I burned the snot outta my fingers.  Too bad I was getting a little old for toys, and that was one item which "got lost" in one of our many moves.
I'm boomer age, mom did her best to set me up as a housewife and mother.  It did not stick.  That toys are still gender based in this century is just nuts.  
Although the original Thingmaker TV commercial shows a girl making bugs, she then makes them into jewelry.  Sigh.
