>I stopped reading after the words rape culture since only bigots use anti-male terms such as rape culture.

Wow, /u/imbrutall. It's pretty misandristic that you think anything involving rape must be against men. You think only men are rapists and sexists?

Rape culture actually refers to a whole set of shared attitudes and behaviors that both men and women partake in. It's the part of our culture that tries to find some way to place at least part of the blame on victims of sexual assault and rape, be they female or male. In the former case, it's usually commentary about how she dressed or how much she drank or whether she did something "risky." In the latter, it's usually about how all guys like sex all the time, or that guys can't get raped because they're "stronger," or that they must be gay if they didn't want to have sex with a woman.
