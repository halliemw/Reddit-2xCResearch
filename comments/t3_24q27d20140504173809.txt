I know you are crazy for G, but his raging jealousy is a huge red flag.  I am not convinced that he would approve of your female friends if you had them - he may be one of those people who wants to be someone's one-and-only everything, which is a recipe for disaster.

You should not have to sabotage your friendships or work relationships for anyone.  Those are the things that sustain you when everything else falls apart.  If they are guys, well, he has no reason to be jealous - if there was romantic chemistry there, that would have already been acted upon. If he wants to date you, he has to trust *you*.

Now, that being said, if you are interested in having more female friends, I think you should look for women more like yourself - not too girly, lots of guy friends, similar interests, etc etc.  If you want to perform femininity more (wear makeup, etc), then you don't need anyone's permission to do it - have fun, play around with it, own it.  And don't do it to try to attract anyone, gal friends or guys.  Do it because you are a girl, and it makes you feel pretty, and you enjoy that feeling regardless of how anyone else receives it.  Including G.
