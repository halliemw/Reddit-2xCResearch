I've worked with developmentally Disabled individuals for a long time now. I've encountered this behavior quite often. The first thing that you should do in the future, because To be honest it will happen again if you are in the same field, is redirect the behavior immediately. You don't have to be rude, but definitely Stern.  If they poke your butt to get your attention,  turn around and immediately tell them that the behavior is wrong and if they do it again they will have consequences. You can't brush off the behavior because they have learning disabilities. They still need to know the consequences of their actions.
