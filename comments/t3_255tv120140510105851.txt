I'm proud of you for calling the police and for coming around to the idea that your bf *should* have been arrested. I hope he leaves you alone.


I was in an abusive relationship with another woman. It went from her physically abusing me to her abusing me and me fighting back, and finally it got to the point where I was initiating physical fights.


I eventually realized that I was staying because I wanted her to see that I was worthy. By the end I no longer cared what she thought of me. I found myself worthy. I moved far away and sure enough, she suddenly loved me and couldn't live without me. Too late.


I hope you stay strong. Much luck to you!
