i'm not trying to delegitimize your feelings, but it seems like your fears are more to do with anxiety and insecurity instead of reality. it's not that big, it's not that visible, and it's not distracting. when i look at those photos of your face, i'm not focusing on the mole. i really only registered it because you asked people to evaluate its presence.

i support people taking healthy steps to increase their self-confidence, but if this has a chance of scarring nastily, i wonder if you'll just become self-conscious about the scarring instead. it really seems like you've built your mole up to be this big thing in your mind, whereas it's barely noticeable in real life. i highly doubt people actually refer to you as "the girl with the mole". 

i also highly doubt your doctor is lying to you about the potential negative effects of removing it. how does he benefit from lying? get a second opinion and consider seeing a counselor before you sink money into this, especially if there's a chance it will turn out poorly and end up increasing your anxiety.
