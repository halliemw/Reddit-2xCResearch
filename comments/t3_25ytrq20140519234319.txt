I've been shown a lot of videos and disturbing content both professionally (medical field) and in school.  Rape, needles, horribly graphic images of body parts, etc.  And *every time* something like that was going to come up, the teacher/professor/doctor/professional warned people ahead of time.  I thought it is just considered common courtesy to let people know when you were going to show them something that might be disturbing to them.  It's normal to be upset by these things, and it's generally easier to handle them if you've been told in advance that it's coming.
