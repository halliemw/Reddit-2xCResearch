This is a really difficult time in a young girl's life.  It's great that you're trying to do what you can to address this issue with her, seeing as you're a primary figure in her life.  I wish that when I was her age, I had someone to talk to me about these things.  I don't know how much I can help you with what to say to her, but there seems to be a lot of great answers to this from other users.  The only piece of advice that I can offer is for you to make sure that she knows that no one has the right to make her feel uncomfortable, and that she has the right to take action when someone does this.  Whether it be by walking away, telling soemone about what happened, or simply telling the person who is making her uncomfortable to stop.  Sometimes women, myself included, feel awkward speaking up in situations like this, where someone is staring or making comments directed at our bodies.  Empower her to stand strong.
