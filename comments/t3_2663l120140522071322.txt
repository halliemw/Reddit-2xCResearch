Oh, I've felt the backlash, but most of it's coming from D. Even people who were offended by his art don't want to speak up about it. Their reasoning is, "it happened a while ago, he doesn't come to meetings that often, I'm sure he's learned his lesson, etc." My friend, Z, has explained to D that comics is already a hostile environment for women and that he is not helping the situation (again, D was dismissive of this and claimed that his work was satire that she just didn't get, but then never explained how his work was supposed to be satirical). I've asked D to explain the art to me, but he just gets dismissive and huffy and says that I just don't get it.
