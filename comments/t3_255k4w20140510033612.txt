If you're ordering from a company that prints their own shirts, ask what brand they're printing on and ask if it's a ladies shirt or a juniors shirt. A lot of t-shirt companies are selling juniors sizes as women's sizes. 

The company I work for prints on ladies Fruit of The Loom shirts and they actually have a decent length and normal sleeves!
