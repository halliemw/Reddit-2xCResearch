I'm not saying that people shouldn't check each other out, or look at each other.  I feel that you're moving goalposts a bit here--glancing at someone is not what we're talking about here.

Leering, staring, looking intensely--things that would be considered rude whether the individual being looked at was a pretty girl or not.  And considering we teach young children not to stare, it shouldn't be hard to continue this into the teen years.

It's silly to act as though this is impossible to change behaviour, and that teen boys are entirely and fully at the whim of their hormones, and really it is an insult to teens everywhere when people say things like this.
