Oh yes! Good news, actually:
My friend eventually filed a complaint against the officer who took her initial report (two months later). Long story short, a female sexual assault detective called her and apologized, said that she was searching for the man because two other women had come forward after being assaulted by him in similar ways, my friend was able to submit a real, thought out statement, and the court process started. He's in prison now for 15 years. We don't feel that's enough time, but at least I personally now have some restored faith in the justice system.
