Meh.  Different strokes, I guess

I splurged on gourmet food and drink, but had an amateur friend take our pictures.  I figured I'd treasure the pictures for the memories they held, not the quality of the photographs themselves.  

It was worth far more to me to splurge on making the positive memories in the first place (by creating an environment and meal my family and friends would love) rather than spending money on documenting it.  My pictures turned out lovely, even if a few are overexposed or poorly lit.  They're made extra special by the memories of my friend/photographer goofing around with the family while she took them.
