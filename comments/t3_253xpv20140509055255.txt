Needs a bit of backstory, but bear with me: In my late teens and early 20s, I was active in several fansubbing groups. There was one co-subber I had been friends with online for about three years, and we decided that I would stop by where he lived on my way to Amsterdam. We did and went from friends to a couple in one magical afternoon. 

He ended up joining me in Amsterdam. I was staying with a couchsurfer I had hosted before in Vienna, and he didn't mind another person coming and staying there. In our first day there, things get hot and heavy, everything seems to be going fine aside from needing to encourage my ex a few times, until he pulls out and all of a sudden everything is wet, like a little waterfall coming out of meâ€¦ everything is covered in bright red blood, mixed with semen here and there - apparently he tore something on his penis during sex, but wasn't in pain at all (not sure how that is even possible). 

Thankfully, the friend we're staying with is at work, so we have a few hours to try and get the mattress clean. While we're furiously cleaning away, boyfriend at the time looks at me and goes: "Never thought I'd lose my virginity like that." I had no idea.
