I'm afraid I fail to see why or how her response was "awesome".  She admitted the responses "deflated" her experience of and excitement for the event and how she too cried.  She also mentioned she would deliberately wear the dress to the same event next year in "protest".  Ultimately, all she did was validate the "trolls" - if an opinion is worthless it is unworthy of such public consideration and deliberate defiance.
