It is under the guise of sick pay. One shouldn't be entitled to extra sick pay so it would come out of the same pool as anyone else has.   

Of course if your employer doesn't have sick pay then you're out of luck the same as anyone else unable to work.   

Such sick leave is easily abused but no more than any other sick leave.   


Don't be surprised if others think you are faking it. That is a common reaction. The person who has to take sick leave due to a migraine will often have a hard time explaining that a migraine is a bit different from a mere headache.
