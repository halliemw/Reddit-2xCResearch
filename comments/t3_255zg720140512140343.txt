I'm so sorry to hear that.  I can't imagine the pain, the loss. I'm so happy to hear that your life has had such happiness in it as well (and congratulations on your upcoming wedding!)

More than anything in the world, I want to be there for all those moments...I see this fierce, intelligent young girl, and I want to see the woman she will become.  It breaks me that I won't. So I hold her close, and tell her that I love her, *"all the way down, all the way through"*, and I hope beyond hope that those words stay with her, and when things are tough and she feels alone, that she remembers that she has that love no matter what.
