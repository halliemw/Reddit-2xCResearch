It's not solely based on their race, it's also based on the school being inner city. We can pretend that it's not dangerous for a white person to be in a majority black school in a rough area, but we'd be lying to ourselves. Acknowledging that racial tensions exist and can be a source of danger isn't racist. 

That said, if OP is right about the school being one of the better ones she probably has nothing to worry about.
