I'm going to be 30 soon and I still have troubles remembering I am late 20s or in general my age, and what 10 years ago means ( hint, it's 2004 wtf). But if 30 is old then what is 40? Zombie? Then 50 is mummy... And 60 is ressurected vampire. And 70 is .... Errrrrr ... Seee I am running out of things to top it off with :)

Therefore 30 can't be old yet.
