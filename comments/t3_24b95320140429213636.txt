Not pregnant, but fuck this article. Seriously. Not a single bother to explain all those shitty circumstances. My boobs swell around my period and I don't let my bf touch them because it hurts. It's not because I feel like being mean and I can imagine that pregnancy makes it worse. And lazy?! Never mind that she might be just completely wiped out for growing a god damned human inside of her. Nah bro, she's just preggo and you know how pregnant chicks can be right? Give me a fucking break.
