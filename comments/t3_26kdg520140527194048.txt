> all of my shirts were too short,

Ha! This is what I feel as well.  It's like all the ones that I love for the summer, middies, waist length, crops - no way this summer!  I've tried them on and it's embarrassing.
I usually wear baggy stuff anyway 9 months out of the year.  I have already decided Im wearing my baggy sweats all summer too!
