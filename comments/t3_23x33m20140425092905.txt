You have NOT torn your family apart, you questioned the status quo and the status was not...quo! That situation wasn't healthy or safe for anyone and the only person you would have helped by staying in it was your dad. Without you guys and your percieved obligation to stay around him because "family" it sounds like he would be a very lonely guy.

Taking that first shot and making the break for it is putting the first cracks in the walls he's built to keep you all near him. You are making it easier for your mom and/or brother to get out too. Some day in the future your actions may even bring your family back together under much happier, more real and honest circumstances.
