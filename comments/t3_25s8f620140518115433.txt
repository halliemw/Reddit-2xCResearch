I don't think it's fair to not care about fashion culture except for when being criticized by it.

Either you care and try to fit in and worry about what people who are primarily concerned with fashion have to say,  or you don't care and you don't get surprised or feel bad when you don't fit into that world (because you weren't trying to anyway).
