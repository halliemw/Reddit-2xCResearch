If you're unhappy, especially in the way it seems, ending it is probably your best course of action. It sounds like you both care about each other, and you don't have to be jerk. You can be kind and let him know you care, but you don't see it as long term. Wish him the best, and mean it. 

If you don't feel secure in the relationship you have now, remember it won't get better.

You're not an asshole in trying to make your life as best as you can. Settling because something is easy is worse.
