No. Douching will only remove the good bacteria and make room for bad bacteria and yeast to grow. Drink lots of water, take cranberry pills toward off a UTI, and keep an eye out for symptoms of a UTI or BV. I wouldn't be too worried about yeast, but he introduced E. coli and other fecal bacteria to your vagina so BV is a big concern.
