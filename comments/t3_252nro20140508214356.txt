I love putting my makeup on in the morning, just because it puts me in a good mood and makes me feel great about myself. I don't see it as a waste of time because it improves my outlook. I ignore those who tell me I look sick on the odd day where I don't.

Also perfectly valid options:

* not ever wearing makeup
* saving it for special occasions
* doing whatever else you want with your own face
