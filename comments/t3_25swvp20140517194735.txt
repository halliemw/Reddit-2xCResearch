You know, in Texas, it's not illegal to shoot someone in self defense. Not that I would advocate violence, but at least you have recourse if a situation goes south (pun...intended?) 

My ex's uncle was fixing a roof once and calmly watched a man trying to break into his car. After a few minutes he picked up his gun and shot him. People don't mess around here.

Edit: there seems to be some confusion as to the correlation of my statement and purpose. I've edited the formatting to make it more obvious that the shooting example has nothing to do with OP's personal situation, just that people in Texas will most definitely use guns when deemed necessary, and that the culture and laws allow them to.
