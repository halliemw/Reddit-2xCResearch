>The problem is that even these women in leadership roles who should be critiqued for their ability to lead & motivate are instead critiqued on appearance.

You're absolutely right. That is a problem, but its a problem because its real women who deserve to be recognized as role models for young women to aspire to be like. These are women who are active in our society and are playing a vital role in the world we live in today. Its sad that there is even an issue on the amount of respect they receive. 

But a fictional character created in a world of fantasy shouldn't have to be held by those same guidelines. They're not real. The only impact they have on the world we live is created by parents who failed to teach their children how to treat and respect people. They aren't role models. They're created from people's imagination. You don't find it silly that you're saying potential leaders of the free world and a figment of someones imagination should be respected in the same manner?
