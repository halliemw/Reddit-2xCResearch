Here, here, from another 'Cyster'. I usually don't shave my legs, because it's a pain and I have healing-factor issues, so nicks are an actual problem for me--but, because of societal conditioning, I shave my arms. I shouldn't, but I still feel like at least SOME goddamn part of my body should be feminine and smooth!

Also, thank the gods for Amanda Palmer. She doesn't have much body hair, but it's dark, and she has absolutely no issue with having it. She's been an inspiration.
