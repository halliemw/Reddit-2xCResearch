Time off for kids is only part of it.  The danger of the job (chance of death/injury), hours of overtime, physical difficulty, chance of future unemployment, etc. can be different.  If a job could result in one dying, requires risk taking, or prevents one from having a life outside of work then it's going to pay more.

It makes no sense to compare the salary of a stock broker or oil rig worker to the salary of a stable job in an office.
