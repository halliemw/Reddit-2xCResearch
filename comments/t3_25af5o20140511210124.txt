thanks for sharing this. 

I lost my mom to a 2.5 year battle with cancer when I was 14, and I wish she had been around to see me graduate high school and go off to college.

I wish I had some tangible memory of her like your baby book, but due to a more complicated family situation (my dad was abusive towards her, my grandma/her mother-in-law hated her), pretty much all of her stuff was thrown out or donated after she died, so today is a pretty bittersweet day for me too.
