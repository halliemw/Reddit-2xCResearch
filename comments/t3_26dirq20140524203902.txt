i wonder if the big difference is the feeling that being told 

"you are the best woman in the field" = there are men that are better than you 

or

"you are best in the field, even though you are a woman" = you are great despite your 'handicap'

or

"you are the best in the field and a woman" = you are good but you also happen to be a woman/left-handed/blue-eyed/asian/black/gay/etc

so when the distinction is being made even though it is not necessary, i can see some people being uncomfortable.
