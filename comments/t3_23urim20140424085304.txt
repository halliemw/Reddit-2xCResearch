Get yourself to a women's heath clinic ASAP. The sooner you get there the more options you have.

It's tough to be young and deal with this. You're going to have to advocate for your health care, and you'll have to be very careful about your privacy.  Teenagers are vicious when it comes to pregnancy rumors. If you're in over your head, get in contact with your school's counselor. They'll have to keep your information private. And be sure to ask and make sure if the counselor is legally required to keep your conversations private. (I don't know what the laws are in Canada)

When you visit the doctor: ALWAYS write down the questions you have for the doctor and your expectations for the visit. Having a written copy always helps make sure all your questions are answered and all your issues are assessed.

You're not alone. I'm a person who thinks when you want to a baby is a choice every woman should be able to make. If you're not ready to have a child, then don't have a child. Go and get an abortion ASAP. If you're ready to have a child, but not ready to raise it, then adoption is an excellent path to take. It can offset the cost of prenatal care.

The choice is yours and yours alone.  Whatever you do choose please, please consider your birth control practices. It appears that you're quite fertile, so maybe your current method (no method, pulling out, condoms, or not absolutely perfect pill use) is just not cutting it for your lifestyle.  I highly recommend the IUD. The initial insertion can be quite painful, but the trade off is you get the most effective birth control without a thought about it for 5 full years.

You are strong enough to get through this.
