Amusing? Intentional misunderstanding? I'm being 100% serious. 

Did you even read the article? The girl ran outside crying and shaking. I get the impression that this happened while her mom was outside waiting, but the article doesn't make that clear.

At any rate, the damage is already done at that point-- noticing afterwards doesn't prevent anything. There is no realistic way a teacher could have prevented this.
