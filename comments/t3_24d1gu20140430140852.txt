The article is kind of irritating to read. It's not that she's wrong. People do treat women differently from in regards to be single especially as they get older. Maybe it's her writing style but it just strikes me wrong. I can't put my finger on it. It comes off almost as hostile to me I think. Really that's my only complaint about the article is that it should have been written from a different perspective I guess. A more journalistic perspective I guess.

This is one of the forms of sexism that is interesting to me. The ones where both men and women perpetuate it. Must suck to be hounded by your friends as to why you don't have a man in your life. "You're so pretty and talented, if you just put yourself out there more...blah blah blah".
