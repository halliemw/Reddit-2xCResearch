This is what I'm afraid of. I don't agree with everything posted here but an overwhelming majority of the people are understanding and very helpful when you come to them in need. I'm scared I won't feel that same sense of community, or that there will be more...hostile? replies to some posts. Maybe I'm just paranoid but I'm kind of losing a safe spot :(
