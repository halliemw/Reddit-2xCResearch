You have zero idea what you are talking about. I am 28, I've gained weight, I've had a baby. Through all of this I have stayed the same or gained a half cup at most and I am not going to stay overweight for a half cup gain that aren't even bigger than my stomach when I am fat enough for that. I breastfed for 3 years and I got smaller, if anything.

The rest of what you are saying may or may not be true, but don't play it off like breast size is a thing you can easily change without surgery.
