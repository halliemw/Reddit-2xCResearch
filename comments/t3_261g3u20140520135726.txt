I know Exactly what you mean about being so smart and charming in some ways and completely broken in others. He was exhilarating and interesting, while also one of the worst, most destructive people I've ever met. Sometimes I kick myself for not leaving him sooner, as soon as I realized he was an alcoholic, but then I realize I can't change the past. Perhaps I really should seek therapy for this situation. My main concern is that therapists I've seen/been associated with, or my friends and family have, generally tend to be trying to sort out some of their own problems as well. I'd worry that a therapist wouldn't really understand.
