I couldn't figure out a way to reply to everyone in the thread, but I wanted to thank you all for some amazing insight (especially for a gal in the northern climes who is just starting to experience this shit) and truthful comments about what I find in stores. What you saw two months ago is just starting here now. Thanks!!
