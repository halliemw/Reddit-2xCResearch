I HAVE to chime in here with my love for Witch Hazel! I was never able to wear nail polish on my finger nails because it would always chip within a few hours of application and peel of pretty quickly (and yes I used acetone to clean my nails before hand). 

Witch hazel is the only thing that allows me to paint my finger nails and have it looking good for a couple days!

Gooo witch hazel!
