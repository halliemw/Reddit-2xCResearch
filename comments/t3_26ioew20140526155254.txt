That was more for 16 year old me than you, but I hope some of it's useful! I'm fighting a battle against a lot of antisocial habits I had as a teenager because being friends with people is awesome and I was and still am pretty lazy about staying in touch with my people. 

And I was so afraid that people would see my fat thighs when I dressed out for gym that I got out of gym class. Lifting weights with a bunch of dudes might have been uncomfortable, but it would have bee better than no gym at all (I got excused from gym to grade papers for a math teacher during gym) and would have helped my self-esteem, level of fitness, and some of my issues with weight. I came to some realizations a lot later than I wanted to.
