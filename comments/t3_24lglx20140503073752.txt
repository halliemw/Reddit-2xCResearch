This is encouraging, thank you. It feels like no one in my area has experience with this kind of disorder; not sure if it's because it isn't the "typical" disorder, or because it's a male sufferer, or a bit of both. I live in the Midwest though and we tend to be slow in catching up with the rest of the world.
