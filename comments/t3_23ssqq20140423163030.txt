I read this, and wanted to say, only you can make the decision that is right for you it's tough to make these kinds of big decisions alone, and I'm sure even in writing this all out you're already feeling a little lighter! Just to get it off of your chest, can make such a difference. 
Have you tried writing a list of pro's a cons? sometimes for me just the act of doing this can make the difference for me, like it is a clear way to see which way my brain is leaning. I don't know what your usual descision making techniques are, but maybe lean on those...

I know you have said that the father isn't really going to help in this situation, but he is part of this and sometimes people surprise you and might even be helpful and step up to the mark, I don't know what will happen but really I do think this is a conversation you should plan to have.

Ultimately I don't think that the answers you are looking for are clear cut and easy, but I wanted to let you know I am reading what you say and I hope that you can find a decision that you are content and happy with! And if you want to talk, I am happy to lend an ear! :)
