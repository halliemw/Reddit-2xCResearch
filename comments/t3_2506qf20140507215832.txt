I think that is a ridiculous idea, people who are really overweight and really want to loose weight are the only ones who need to count calories. If you can focus on getting a diverse amount of vegetables, fruits, and high-quality protein daily you don't need to count calories. 11-13 year old girls already have enough crazy messages coming at them, giving them a complex about how much food they should be eating is not something they need at that age at all.
