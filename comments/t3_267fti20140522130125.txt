I didn't say that your comment was more or less problematic than any other. Personally I find it irritating that you feel that you need to educate women who are happy with their decision to wear hijab by discussing equality and 'that sort of thing' with them, as if those would be new concepts, and as if someone's lifestyle choice is yours to comment in and debate with them.
