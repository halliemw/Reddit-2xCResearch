This is such a beautiful poem, thank you for sharing it and all your beautiful thoughts and advice. Your children are so wonderfully lucky to have you. 
If it's not too much of an imposition (I know we're just internet strangers) but your story has touched me and if you ever feel like shooting me a pm or if I might do the same, I would love more of your insight or just thoughts.
