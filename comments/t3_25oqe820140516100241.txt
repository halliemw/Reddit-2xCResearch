I thought about it too and said in my head that I haven't and then remember the time in high school a friend of mine tried to pull off my bathing suit top without my consent. Sounds like innocent hi jinks until you realize I was alone with him and said no five or six times  before he forcibly tried to dunk me and rip it off. Thankfully I'm a really good swimmer and got away. Sheesh... I wrote it off in my own mind cause I didn't want to think about it.
