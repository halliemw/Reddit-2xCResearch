I really don't think the name of this sub is the problem. Any subreddit dedicated to ladies would be drawing the same criticism from subs like /r/mensrights or trp. I think this sub was a very good choice because of the community and subject matter--we aren't dedicated to feminism, for instance. And we don't post a bunch of memes. This sub's content (while often heavy with trigger warnings) is very thoughtful, and on the whole the community is good at being civil and understanding despite some pretty big differences in opinion.

I think we can do this. We must first wait out the troll/backlash period to dry up (1-2 weeks at the most? most people don't have the energy to sustain this kind of brigading for too long...I hope). Then we need a generous period of time to see what this sub will look like as a default without the mass trolling and brigading. Maybe we will see a rise of casual sexism and male-centric posts that stems from name confusion and default status. But maybe we won't. Maybe we'll attract more female users, more trans* users, etc. Or maybe we won't. But I think its certainly a shot we can take.
