Age 11, was sitting in my room, doing nothing. It was pretty anti-climactic and when I told my mother, she yelled at me for dirtying my underwear (wtf mom). She expected me to know how to deal with it and told me to only use pads because "tampons are unhygienic". lol I wonder how she'd react to menstrual cups. It depressed me to know that I'd have to suffer through it for the majority of my adult life.

Nowadays, I just treat it as a thing that happens. A minor annoyance. Luckily for me, I don't get horrid cramps or anything. But goddamn it are periods irritating.
