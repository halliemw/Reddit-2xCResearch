Yeah that's totally wrong. There are less differences between men and women than people think. a lot of it is societal. 

I became friends with another girl my freshman year at uni and we connected because we were both geeks. She then dropped out of college two weeks in. It was pretty disheartening. She felt SUPER out of place since almost no one in the college of computer science was female. also no one supported her.

I kind of felt the same thing. all through uni, I was super alone, people seemed to expect me to fail. It wasn't until my final (capstone) advisor saw potential in me that I got some confidence.
