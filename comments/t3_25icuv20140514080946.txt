This. Go to the next one. Avoid that guy like the plague. Don't hide your disgust. If he touches you, loudly say "why is someone's hand on my ass when I can clearly see it doesn't belong to my boyfriend?!?!" That loud reaction combined with public shaming makes him look like a jerk and gives you a sense of power again.
