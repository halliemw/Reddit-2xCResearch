My mother-in-law has hair pretty much exactly as you describe yours. She always keeps it up in a little poof on the top of her head and when we go out somewhere (ie: not just running errands) she'll wear a wig. It looks really nice and natural on her. Have you ever considered this? (Not trying to insinuate you haven't tried every single thing possible)

Good luck!
