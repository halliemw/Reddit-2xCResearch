I didn't have to see a gynecologist and found that there was no awkwardness anywhere - everyone was supportive of my decision and wanted the best for me which is what I ultimately got.



I was worried that I would be far more upset but thankfully I'm doing okay.  I think that might also be for the women that really want to have children but maybe have to terminate due to health complication or something.  I don't really know.  I felt myself starting to bond with the bean sized thing inside me in the last week but knew that I just couldn't go through with the pregnancy.  My own family has NO idea that this has happened as they are Catholic so I plan almost never to tell them.



I wish I could say the same for my boyfriend and I though... I mean, it's been about 36 hours since my termination but due to my Catholic background (I'm personally athiest) I'll probably never be able to move in with a man unless I'm married to him (despite already holding down a full time job and living completely independently) he and I still have some major differences we need to sort out.  I love him dearly and I wish he understood just how much I felt myself bond/fall deeper in love with him as I carried not only my, but HIS child, for 8 weeks.  I guess it'll get better as my hormones level out but for now things could certainly be better.
