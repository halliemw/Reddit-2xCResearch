I said high school, maybe middle school. Either way, the only time those age groups run around outside much is gym, in which case they wear different clothing anyways. Also, business casual does not require heels. Flats are quite common. I am business casual at my job and I almost never wear a dress and panty hose. Slacks/khakis, a nice shirt/blouse/sweater, and flats.
