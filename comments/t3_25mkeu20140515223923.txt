How old are you?

I mean really how old are you because after so long in life dealing with this you start not really giving two shits about this crap and giving even less fucks about who the fuck knows it.

*'Oh deary me she seems to be on her monthlys!'* Well congratumotherfuckinglations motherfucker you've caught me doing something that I can only assume I will be doing for over half of my life: Bleeding from my vagina. You're just goddamned well lucky I went to the bathroom to clean it up instead of painting your bedroom sheets with it.


I don't see why you need to bury a used tampon in the trash like a squirrel hiding a nut. Wrap it and trash it. It's not rocket science nor is it something to be ashamed of. You people act like when someone goes to the bathroom they're doing some kinda magical thing in there besides going to the fucking bathroom.
