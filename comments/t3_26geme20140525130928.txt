I have a zero bullshit approach also, but I try not to be a jerk about it.  

Why is communicating her feelings to someone she considers a good friend, making it into a catastrophe?  She's obviously upset about it.  It's called enforcing boundaries.  

> And how else would you want him to ask her for why she gained weight, maybe trying to actually ask for what issues or problems she might have leading to it?

You don't ask.  Period.  If he wanted to know how she was doing emotionally, he could just ask if she was OK.  But he didn't.  He framed it with her weight.    

> I'd say it is perfectly OK to comment anyone on their weight. It seems very weird to me, that you describe something so mundane and natural as "weird and gross".

The only people that should be talking about someone's weight is that person and his/her doctor.  It's not mundane and natural, but the cause of a lot of self-esteem issues.  Especially with women as the cultural narrative is that our entire worth is intertwined with our looks.  Bringing it up to a lot of people is poking a hornets nest of emotions.  Why would you intentionally want to do that to someone you consider a friend?
