From a guy's perspective - I've been with my fiance for 6 years, engaged for two (She got accepted to nursing school very shortly after we got engaged, decided to wait until she finished to get married.)  Fully monogamous relationship.

She has been on the pill and takes it regularly every day.  We occasionally don't use a condom, but I always pull out.  One time I didn't, nothing bad happened, we just know we aren't ready to bring a child into this world.  If she were to get pregnant, It wouldn't matter, we'd obviously change our plans.  Regardless, we choose to be safer just to ease our minds.
