I don't know. I'm in a male dominated field and sometime things like this feel like a big deal. Sometimes they don't. 

However, the most frustrating thing about the religion I was raised with is that I was always a woman first and a human being second. I sometimes feel this same feeling being an engineer. I don't want to be a "woman engineer" I'm just an engineer. This doesn't mean that I don't support outreach that encourages girls to participate in science and engineering. It is important to acknowledge the social pressures in play, but sometimes I don't want to be "a woman." I just want to be a person.
