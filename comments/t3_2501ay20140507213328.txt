It depends where you live. Many places have laws against photographing someone when they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, it's a felony. You can also follow up with a civil suit for emotional and reputation damages done by him. 

If there are laws against this where you live, figure out which area of the police force deal with this and find the departments number. Give them a call and ask how you'd go about pressing charges. Having the police go over and delete them from his phone (if you're fortunate enough to live in a place that outlaws photographing someone under a reasonable expectation of privacy) means they might be able to delete them and get them off any information storage devices.

If he's put them online, sue him for emotional damages. 

He's banking on you being too scared to tell other people, or you not finding out. He's a fucking coward. Sick the police or a lawyer on him and he'll realize how shitty it is to have someone ruin your reputation and risk a permanent stain on your record. The only differences is, unlike what he's doing to you by taking those photos, he'll deserve whatever fallout happens.
