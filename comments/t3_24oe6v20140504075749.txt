That would be a great option (it's what my husband is aiming for) but unfortunately it's not really possible in our field. It's so competitive in our field that unless you're exceptional (neither of us are) you have to do usually at least 3-4 "postdocs" (temporary two year positions anywhere in the world) before you have a chance at a permanent position.
