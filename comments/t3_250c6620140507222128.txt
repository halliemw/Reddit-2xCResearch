Do you have a reason to believe she will not be able to complete her duties as a bridesmaid? If not, I would just go with it, but that's just my opinion. I'm getting married in three months and I'm finding that drama is almost inevitable and people get weird. I would sit down and talk to her about your concerns and ask her if she has changed her mind in any way about being your bridesmaid.
