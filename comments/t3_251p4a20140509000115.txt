I think a lot of people are taking issue with the part where you get more into the "do women really need a space?" and the "it's hard to believe that women are the brunt of being assumed to be a male" stuff than the "they should have included OneY on the front page, too." I don't know why 2xc got singled out but the people here didn't ask for it. I'd rather it be more fair than it is now, though. 

There's nothing inherently wrong with niche communities, and I don't think you understand it very well if you think it's an 'us versus them" environment. Everyone is free to participate but as the subreddits name suggests, the subject matter us tailored. It's not that we don't want men around, period, it's that we want reasonable people who aren't sexist and who are willing to actually consider the "female experience" of life instead of just rejecting it or constantly injecting hostility into debates if they haven't an ounce of empathy. 

That said, I agree that the admins are probably trying to make compensate and they're picking the wrong sub to do it with. In your other post you had a good idea about making female-dominated-hobby subs defaults. It would at least be more consistent.
