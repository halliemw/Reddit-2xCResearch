>Is that so? You have statistics or something, or are you just guessing as to how you think it goes down.

Nope. Just the years of going to parties and seeing people hook up. 

>Majority of the time *of what,* anyway? Majority of the time people have sex? Majority of the time people have sex that later results in a rape accusation? 

Uh no. The majority of time people met up while drinking and then have sex later. 


>There it is! There's the truth! These people worried about being accused of rape are only after getting laid with strangers and that's why they struggle to admit that taking advantage of a drunk stranger is rape: because it's what they want so badly and it's the only way they can get laid that they insist that it isn't rape. 

LMFAO the only way they can get laid? So fucking insulting. Sometimes people just want to get drunk, have fun, and have some no strings attached sex. That doesn't mean it's the only way they can get laid. AND OH MY GOD NO ONE IS SAYING THAT AN OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE IN INTOXICATION ISN'T TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE. Stop parading that fact around like you're the first person to think of it. If I go to a party, start to drink, meet a guy that has also been drinking, and decide to have sex with him that night it is not rape. Neither of us are taking vantage of each other. And you know what? If I never want to see him or talk to him again then that is my prerogative. If that's the case then I'm sure as shit not going to want to go to the movies or something with him later that week.
