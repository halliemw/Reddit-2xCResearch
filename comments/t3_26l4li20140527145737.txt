> The fact that he has sympathizers is disturbing in and of itself

He's was a terrible person who did a terrible thing, but there are still many people that at least understand his loneliness.  Sympathy is not the same as apology.

Also, his sympathizers seem to be few and far between, anyway.

I can sympathize with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, for example.  I don't condone his actions, but I acknowledge the fact that he was heavily influenced by his brother and may not have fully understood what was going to happen (although I'm not sure if this is true, in which case hypothetically).

> The idea that mass murder is the inevitable result of failure of a 22 year old to get a girlfriend is toxic.

Yeah, no shit.  But there are very few people that are saying this was inevitable given his situation.
