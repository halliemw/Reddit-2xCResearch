I'm 26 now and I got my first one at 18. As little as 8 years ago it was the norm to get your first one as soon as you became sexually active or as soon as you hit 18, whichever came first. 

I'm only mentioning this because it's not really that shocking. You'll find plenty of woman my age or older who had one at an early age if you search this subreddit for Pap smears. It's not the same anymore, sure, but it used to be that way.
