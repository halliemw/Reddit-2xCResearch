Big bang theory is the worst. Having female characters doesn't equate to being good. I hated how the women were portrayed in that show, they only exist because they're girlfriends. Penny is basically Sheldon's mother, which is worse IMO.

I'm surprised modern family didn't pass, the daughters of Phil & Claire are pretty good characters.
