Thank you for the reassurance. I have an interview scheduled tomorrow who actually called me for an interview before I got his job and told me if it didn't work out to call them, so I did! And they're very excited to interview me. I LOVE the work, just not the crazy boss.

And it's only him and me so it's not like I have someone else to talk to. That makes it pretty hard.
