First trimester abortion is legal where I live and easily accessible. I also opted for the medical type procedure, with pills that I inserted at a friend's because I lived with my parents at the time. Even though it's legal and relatively simple here, it was still a nightmarish experience, just like you described. It was easily one of the most traumatic experiences of my life; nothing that I was told about the procedure prepared me for the reality of it. And even though abortion is legal and pretty widely socially accepted here, there's no such thing as a support group for people who have been traumatized by their experience who aren't ready to renounce their decision as a moral mistake. In a way I'm glad it wasn't so easy-peasy, because otherwise I may have been temped to just push it out of my mind. Making abortion legal and accessible is obviously a huge and important first step for women all over the world, but unfortunately it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to minimizing the potentially traumatic aftermath. 

Thank you for taking the time to share your experience here, your story gave me some comfort.
