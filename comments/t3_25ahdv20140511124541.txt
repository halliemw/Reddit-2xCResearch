I've had similar problems in the past, and it was largely out of fear that I was overstating my role. I didn't want a prospective employer to call my references only to have my references say, "yeah, she's great, but actually she participated at level X not level Y".

What I've learned to do is look for words that are a good compromise - for example, on a project where I did about 99% of the work, I wrote "co-authored" since publishing is really important in my field. To acknowledge that I did most of the work, the bullet point preceding co-authorship said that I "led a team of researchers developing an assay for XYZ".

Something that I've found really helps is to talk to someone else about your qualifications, or at the very least take a BIG step back and try to look at your work objectively. What I've done in the past is to write a resume that has a lot of the stronger language, but before I start using it for job applications, I shoot my references a past email with my description of my duties under their supervision and ask for their opinion.
