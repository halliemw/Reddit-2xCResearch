No, there's no law that says there is *supposed* to be two investigations, only laws that say the complainant *may* have two investigations.  Nothing kicks one investigation up to the other level (except when it hits the papers, but that's because of public opinion and that's a very imperfect manner of handling crime).

Yes, victims go to faculty, counselors, peer, hotlines, etc., and get the advice to go to campus police (because that's what everyone is trained to do).  Rarely does "administration" even hear about it (unless they're very proactive.  

Victims are not well educated about the process - but colleges are hardly exceptional.  That's true for victims everywhere.
