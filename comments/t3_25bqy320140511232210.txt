I wouldn't characterise it so much as 'fear' in the sense that most people think about it, more that I am constantly *wary*. Like here, I'll give you an example - walking home at night I try to stay in the light, have my keys in my hand, be aware of my surroundings, keep an eye on any strange men nearby, etc. Does that make more sense? 

Keep in mind that women are not a monolith, not all of us have the same reactions and feelings. Many women do report feelings of anxiety and wariness when it comes to being on their own, though.
