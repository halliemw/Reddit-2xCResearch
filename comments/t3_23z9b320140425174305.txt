When I was ten, I got Harvey, a spirited ginger tom kitten.  He didn't destroy furniture so much as frighten guests by sproinging out of nowhere onto their chests and clinging with his claws.  He used to wake me up every morning by biting my nose. Then, once I was awake, he'd attack my feet.

He grew out of his bad manners into a huge, loving, friendly, drooling lap cat who presented himself to strangers' laps as if he was the greatest gift.  He was also an accomplished hunter who left us rat tail trophies, and he was a crazy guard cat.  He protected our border collie, Petey, from intruding dogs.

I miss him.

May Freya bring you many years of delightful absurdity and furry kitty love.
