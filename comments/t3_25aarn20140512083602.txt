There is absolutely room for disagreement here. As a father, I don't comment much on my kids' appearances. I am confident that whatever decisions they make in their youth, be they to reject various social norms through smoking, hair dying, piercings, shaving/not shaving, or whatever, they will probably eventually realize that all of these rebellious behaviors end up being inconvenient to them with no actual gain, and that they will figure it out on their own. But I can also respect parents out there who know that their kids are screwing themselves over and are trying to help them. 

Having been an unreachable idiot myself when I was younger, I consider it a waste of time to try to reason with people between 13-25 about such things. For me, it wasn't a rebellious phase of self-discovery. No way, man, it was the real deal. I was going to do things my way because I didn't need to fit into some predefined cookie cutter image of arbitrary social norms. And lots of people feel that way. But then eventually I escaped my parents gravity, at which point it became glaringly obvious that smoking isn't an expression of individuality, it's just a really dumb thing to do. And my long hair wasn't part of who I am, it was just a pain in the ass and extra work when I got out of the shower. And my shitty sense of fashion didn't make me unique or stylish, it just made me celibate because I looked like shit. So if a young woman wants a giant bush or a young dude wants a giant neckbeard, go for it.  I'm just suggesting that such individuals recognize that there's a good chance that their parents are trying to show them a shortcut through all the awful steps of growing up toward a place where you look good, enjoy positive responses from strangers, and people want to have sex with you. Because all of those things are way more enjoyable than whatever naval-gazing self-congratulatory blather I was doing before.
