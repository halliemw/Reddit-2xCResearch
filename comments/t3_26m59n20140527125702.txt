I've been in this exact same roommate situation. 

When I spoke to my roommate it was a lot easier than expected. She genuinely apologized for making me uncomfortable, and in our situation her SO was between leases. She agreed that #1) he would not be there if she wasn't there, #2) they would spend more time in her room which helped it feel like they weren't just lounging on the couch all day in the middle of my apartment, and #3) he offered to completely cover the electricity bill which was great. 

This girl having a key is not cool and you absolutely have the right to tell your roommate that. Just approach the situation calmly and explain how it's making you feel. Worst case scenario she tells you to buzz off and you can go to the leasing office where they would absolutely take your side.
