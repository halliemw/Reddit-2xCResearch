I'm in agreement about the foot in the mouth. It's really easy to layer on a lot of malice to his comment, he may be just someone who says whatever comes to mind and at that moment a female was telling him she's cutting her hair really short and his brain automatically was like nah "not my thing."

I've commented before to male classmates that I like particular things about male bodies and some things that I don't like. I never meant it in a derogatory way towards my friend, it's just a honest discussion.
