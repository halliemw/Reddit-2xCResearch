A lot of things I wanted to say has already been covered in the other replies, but I did want to address this:

> Today at the gym, for example, there was a problem with android phones connecting to the WiFi, so I helped a few (admittedly, all male patrons) fix the issue on their phones. I didn't even make the connection that they may have been approaching me with the intent to flirt with me until G pointed it out. I was just trying to help!

> G is now frustrated with me for "playing naive", and I'm frustrated with myself for not removing myself from the aforementioned situation.

Umm... it is possible for guys to approach a girl without the intention of wanting to flirt. It is very possible that some of those guys were really asking for your help and that's it. I don't think it's a good thing either to view any/all male attention as having some ulterior motives, which is what it seems like your bf is trying to imply or convince you of...
