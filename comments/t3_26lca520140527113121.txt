The only circumstance where i could MAYBE imagine the guy's twitter comments be... kind of... explainable, is if he was ironically joking with his friends. In today's world with so many controversial subjects, it can be a way of blowing steam. Personally, i'm disgusted by racism and all manner of hate-speech, but i still enjoy racist humour, because it's impossible for me to relate to such idiotic patterns of thought.

Regardless, this dude may or may not be a real misogynist, but he is without a doubt fucking stupid for saying stuff like that on twitter.
