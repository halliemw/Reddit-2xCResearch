Well it's not /r/mensrights. I agree with you there are men's issues. The way that subreddit has chosen to go about it includes doxxing (including of the wrong person) and filing false rape claims en masse on an anonymous rape reporter site at a university trying to gauge how big a problem they were dealing with.

It's not just a small contingent unfortunately. The pro-doxxing leader's website is linked on the sidebar. Reddit admins have had to step in to ban mods for encouraging doxxing.
