it sickens me that rape kits are given such low priority. but i'm so glad this whole ordeal is finally over for you, and even though i don't know you, i'm proud of you for seeing it through. many people would have given up a long time ago.

are you currently seeing a mental health professional? if not, it might be worth going to a couple of sessions to help process this. it's obviously a highly emotional event for you, and sometimes we respond in unexpected ways. 

congratulations!!! good luck :)
