I was that little girl many years ago. My mother destroyed my family in just this way. Fortunately for me, I was strong enough to break away from her when I was 17 and went off to university. 

I'm an atheist, too, and it is a mental illness that sends some religious people around the bend. I'm so sorry to hear about your pain, but know that your children can come through this, as long as you stay a strong presence in their lives. My darling father told me to get the most education I could and always think for myself. I finished a PhD and shook the dust of fairy tales off my shoes long ago. Your kids can, too. Best wishes, warm hugs.
