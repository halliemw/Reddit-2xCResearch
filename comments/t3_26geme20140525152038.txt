For the sake of arguments?  How dismissive.  "Fat" in western culture has become synonymous with ugly, lazy and worthless.  

Weight is a cause of severe self-esteem issues for many people.  Even when they "know" the cultural messages around it are a load of shit.  You have *no idea* how it's going to be received or how they will be affected.  

I'm not touchy about my weight personally, but I still think it's gross if people think it's OK to comment about it positive or negatively.  Body image and weight are such personal issues for many people, I do not understand why anyone would think *any comments* are OK.
