My best guy friend, just recently. I was commenting on an adorable picture of him and his wife, and said something to the effect of "She really must teach me how to be that photogenic someday, you guys look amazing!".  I wasn't fishing for compliments, I genuinely just thought they were adorable.  He responded that I'm always beautiful and I shouldn't be so negative about myself.  He's happily married and our relationship is of the brotherly/sisterly sort, so I took it as he meant it, as the sweetest thing ever. Makes me squirm with glee just thinking about it. :-D
