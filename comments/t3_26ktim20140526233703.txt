Consider inviting the one person in the group who seems most close (least distant?) to you for a one-on-one hangout. "Hey, can you and I get some pizza and catch up this week? I feel like we haven't talked in *forever*" or something similar should be pretty low-stakes.

If you do this with enough members of the group, pretty soon a sizeable contingent will feel obligated to start including you in things like going around asking questions of everyone, and if the problem is just that they don't want to pressure the shy quiet person into talking, that would take care of it.

It sucks when friend circles aren't forming organically, and I still haven't gotten my own social life back to where it was before I had to move, but it means you have to reach out even more to each person. Hopefully you find some people who reach back soon.

Hugs!
