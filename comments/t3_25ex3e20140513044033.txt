I don't think it's ok, but I do think it's retroactively justified if you discover that he's been cheating.

If you're a compulsive snooper and you go through your gf's / bf's phone or email on a regular basis, then you deserve to be dumped for it the second time you're discovered.

If your partner has been acting sketchy and you know something's wrong then it can really mess with your head. Snooping is a way to achieve peace of mind.

The police and the state should not violate your privacy unless they have a legitimate reason to believe you've committed a crime, but relationships are not the courtroom.

Relationships are about accepting people even with their flaws, and we all do things sometimes we need to be forgiven (or dumped) for.
