Maybe your SO is thinking "I would never initiate something sexual unless I saw signals from a woman and I can't imagine doing something sexually when I didn't get those signals. I think this is the way the world works." I don't think it's a horrible way to start off thinking, on the surface it's logical. But your boyfriend needs to come around and understand that it isn't the case that harassed women led people on. I think yes, it's victim blaming, but it's not like people don't ever get their misconceptions fixed. If I were you, I would have a serious discussion with him about the issues, maybe find some stories of women who've been harassed. 

I think asking questions about was she flirting/wearing something revealing/leading him on are people's attempts to place order on the world. No one wants to live in a place where you can be sexually harassed for no rhyme or reason, we're humans and we want to try and predict what will happen. If I believe you were flirting and that's why you were harassed, then I believe I can prevent myself from being harassed by not flirting (or my girlfriend can change her behavior to prevent it, or it won't happen to my sister or my mom). It's a way of trying to understand how these things happen. So I don't think you should totally scrap this guy yet. If he's totally hardball on this issue and won't listen to you or try and change his view, then I would dump him.
