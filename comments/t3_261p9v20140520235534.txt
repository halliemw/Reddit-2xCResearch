> I have a feeling that this is happening because historically girls have had to work n times as hard as boys to get equal attention in school, so now that things have evened up a little bit, they're surging ahead. And boys, lacking the privilege they once had, aren't being taught how to buckle down and do the work

This would be a valid argument if boys did better in school and women did better in the work force. Unless you're arguing that forcing me to work hard will make my same-sex children better at working harder. It's not like 6 year old girls are aware that "historically" they needed to work harder. The gap between boys and girls is largest in the *early* grades, before they're socialized to learn they need to work harder. 

If anything, it makes more sense to conclude that boys are unfairly discriminated against in school and need to learn to "try harder" and those translate to better performance in the working world. I don't believe that's why there's work differences, but it makes more sense than your hypothesis.
