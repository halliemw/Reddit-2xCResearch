Yes! It's purely a business relationship. Most of our conversations - at least the ones concerning *me* - centre around school and job applications (especially now that I've recently graduated from university, with no immediate plans moving forward). Interestingly, we've never talked about my long-term career goals or life plans. I feel like I missed out on a lot of important conversations growing up. So many things they were apathetic towards... I really could have benefited from their life experiences/input/direction. More time teaching, less time disciplining.

Every now and then, with some prodding, my parents will talk about 'life before the kids' and I love it! They are actually super interesting people with awesome stories to tell. But for whatever reason they choose not to share them.

Do you have any siblings who perhaps share your viewpoint? I'm considering talking about this with my brother, and then with my parents while he's there, so I'm not alone. But it's such a difficult thing to talk about. The parent/child relationship is so fundamental, and you're outwardly acknowledging that you've been unhappy with it for *years*. How do you recover from something like that?

If it's any solace... it could be much, much worse. At least we have a positive relationship with our parents; many people aren't so lucky. I'm trying to be happy with what I have, because like you say, sometimes it just isn't meant to be.
