"I don't feel ready for a baby, financially and maturity wise."

End of story.

At your age, in my opinion, you're throwing your life away. If you have a child that young, your life is over... and at this point the pitchforks come out, so I will explain. Your life as you know it is over, it isn't about you anymore, it's about the child. It comes first, over you. You lost your freedom, your time, your money, your personal life. Like a butterfly in a cocoon... you're still the same person, yet couldn't be anymore different. So as you said, you don't feel ready, then don't let someone else pressure you into it, you will regret it.
