You're not tearing your family apart. Your dad did that.  
I understand wanting to pack up all your stuff, but before you go, prioritize what is really important to you. Make sure you get that and have someone with you. The rest is just stuff that can be bought and replaced.  
I'm also really sorry about your mom, but the best you can do is make sure you help her if/when she's ready to leave. In the meantime, try to keep contact with her (via email or something), while avoiding contact with your dad. good luck.
