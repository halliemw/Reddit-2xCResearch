This seems like the kind of thing that you should really do your best to try not to make any assumptions or conclusions on. 
This could be a serious sexual abuse thing that he's trying to act tough about and keep quiet, or it could be that when he was a young teen, his dad gave him some playboys and his mother is overreacting. Who knows?
You have no way of knowing without asking, which obviously, might not be something you should do.

I say wait a little while and then tell him something vague about how you'd be there for him no matter what, if he ever needs to talk about something troubling him he can confide in you, etc. Without bringing up specifics. Make sure he simply understands that you're there for him.

Leave it at that.
