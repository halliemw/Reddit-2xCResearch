Make sure that your lubricants and condoms are compatible.  You need a water-based lubricant because an oil based lubricant will degrade natural rubber latex.

Also, a little drop of lubricant on the penis BEFORE the condom goes on will make the experience better for the guy. That little drop is the key to the "no condom feel"

I'd also like to add that sex was a little painful at first, and big Ds were out of the question. Now I don't really have any issues. I totally use lube all the time. Allergy meds dry me out. Oh, and flavored lubes can be fun.. if you go down on your guy after/while he's wearing a condom than the flavored lubes can offset the condom taste.  But condom taste doesn't bother me like it used to.
