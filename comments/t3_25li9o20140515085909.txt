I've been growing my hair for donation for about a year now, but I can't afford monthly trims so I've the same issue. Many charities will trim damaged and/or shorter hair from layer hairstyles and sell them to offset the cost of wig production for their benefactors. Some will not take dyed, permed, or gray hair, others will - but again, they sell it and it supports costs not the actual wigs. I'm okay with that, but many people want their hair to go directly to the kids.
