I was sure I was having some problem with poo coming out.  I was staying at my grandmother's house and had no idea it was my period. The next day I rode my bike to summer camp and *finally* figured out it was my period half way through the morning when there was still more brown, plus some red.  I had to ask an adult to help me out with supplies, and then go home and tell my grandmother I got my period.  She said, "Oh" and then a few hours later said, "Um, was that your first one?"

That is the long way of saying OMG I wish someone told me it might be brown too!
