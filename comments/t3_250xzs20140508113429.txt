So many things wrong here.   
1. Blaming you for his actions: "Why did you let me drink so much?" & refusing to take responsibility  
2. Hitting you  
3. Trying to choke you  
4. Suggesting rape  

Run from this guy. I dated a guy who got violent when he drank. Usually he'd just throw things and shout at me. One night I was fed up and told him I wasn't going to condone this behavior and would talk to him when he calmed down. I had a friend pick me up. He broke into my parked car and peed in the front seat. Yet I didn't break up with him because I was 21 and in love and totally stupid.  

It culminated when he pushed me down the stairs. I stood up and got on my bike to leave, and he pushed me down again. The neighbors heard me screaming and called the cops. I pressed charges but the judge didn't show up to court, so his case was dismissed. I later heard he abused his next several girlfriends.
