I sort of agree with your boyfriend that your beliefs are disturbing. 

They are your beliefs and you are entitled to hold them. But let's discuss some of them since you're asking for feedback.

>I'll give him my body, he'll give me happiness and companionship.

You have more to offer than just your body to your potential husband. 

>I mean, men get married for free sex, right? Let's not kid ourselves here

Nope. Wives are not prostitutes. Sex is widely available without tying your legal and financial fate to a woman. Men get married for the same reason women do - generally because they want to build a partnership, perhaps start a family, and spend the rest of their lives with their best friends. Sex is a way to bond the relationship. Not the currency of the relationship.

>I wouldn't care much for foreplay or any of that after marriage, it's not about me. Men don't need that to enjoy themselves, why should I?

When my husband and I have sex, he only really enjoys himself if I do. Part of the fun of sex is giving each other pleasure and relishing getting better at it each time. It's sad that you believe your future husband is an animal that doesn't give a shit about how you feel. 

>He was very hurt.

As he should be. You basically told him that he was an animal, incapable of love or selflessness or friendship, who is only driven purely by his basest instincts and has no other desires or goals out of his life's relationships.

I'd be pretty offended too.

If I were you, I might seriously rethink my viewpoints on sex and relationships. You seem to have some pretty fucked up notions of reality that may hurt your long-term happiness.
