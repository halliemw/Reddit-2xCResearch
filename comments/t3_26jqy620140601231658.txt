Thank you! My period ended yesterday and the Diva Cup is supposed to get here in a few days. I'm going to practice getting it in and out. I just with there was a way I could figure out if it's in the right place or not before my period started. You know? Like I wish I could practice so I know when my period starts I can just put it in and never touch a pad again.
