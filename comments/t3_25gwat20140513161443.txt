Thank you. I talked to a rape crisis center and I have an appointment for counseling next Wednesday. I don't want to tell anyone I know until after that if at all. I wasn't offended by what you said before. I wanted honest interpretations of the situation because it is confusing for me since I didn't really fight and just said stop after a while. And he did stop, but after a few more hard thrusts that really hurt. 

I'm glad I reached out too. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't talk to anyone at all and no one here is being judgmental  but supportive. I really do appreciate that <3 I feel really dirty and ashamed that I was so naive and that anything happened at all. Guilty because it was a friend, confused because of how aggressive he was. I just don't know.
