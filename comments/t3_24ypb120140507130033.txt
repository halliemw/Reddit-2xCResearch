If you are feeling overwhelmed, take a step back from window shopping and think to yourself, "What exactly do I want."

Do you want a long dress? A short dress? White? Pink? Do you want something that looks like it fell out of a Disney movie or something that you could wear to a line dance?

Think about the things you want, and then go find them. Don't go the other way around - you will only be bombarded with too many choices and all the potential "what ifs."

My husband and I got married and had a reception for 100 people for around $2000. It is entirely doable!
