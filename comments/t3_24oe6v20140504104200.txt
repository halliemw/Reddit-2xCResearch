It's all in what you value.

I personally value people,  relationships,  teaching and helping others, and family.   For me, money isn't all its cracked up to be. I don't care of I am senior top whatever in my field.    When I get to retirement age, I'd rather reflect back on the experiences I had with loving people in my life.  Who cares if I gave my life to a corporation.   I have enough money to buy everything I need at this point in my life. 

 The only sad thing is that right now in our society people seem to look down on women who stay at home or who choose to work less than full time.  I get tired of being asked when I'm going to "look for work" or "find a job".  My financial situation and employment shouldn't be small talk material.

There is no right answer for all women.   You need to do what you feel is best for yourself and for your family.   If you're unsure what general direction to go in, imagine yourself at age 70 and reflecting back on your life.  What might you imagine would be a regret?  What would make you feel most satisfied?
