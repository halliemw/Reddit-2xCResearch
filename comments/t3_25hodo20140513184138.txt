Endo sufferer here. 

Our hormones are such that we require slightly different formulations of birth control. Usually heavy progesterone ones are good to suppress endo growth and symptoms. 

There are so many different types and formulations of birth control, sometimes it takes some experimentation to find the one that's right for your chemistry. 

Try to encourage your GF not to give up and to keep trying. 

Be patient with her sex drive and craziness while she finds that right variety. 

And make sure that her doctor is aware that she's experimenting with BC formulation and will help adjust her script as she goes.
