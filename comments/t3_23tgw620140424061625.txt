Oh they are! Absolutely do not douche when you don't have a clear medical need for it. Definitely don't make it a habit. But in this case, (and also, now that I remember it, I was prescribed the same treatment in college after I had cryosurgery) it is simply easier and more effective than the alternatives. The doc even specifically told me that an oral antibiotic would be more detrimental to the natural flora of your lady bits than the vinegar douche. Kill the BV, then don't do it anymore. Also, don't substitute with store bought douches. Plain white vinegar - from the grocery.
