Ugh, I have a friend who likes to walk home from bars and our place at all hours. It always stresses me out, but she insists that she'll be fine. She's like 5'5 and stick thin. I'm 6'1 and I get nervous sometimes walking around here, so it frustrates me to no end that she insists on walking home alone.
