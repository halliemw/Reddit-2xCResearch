When I first got my Passat (1997 model year, new to me in 2011) it had broken/breaking door handles all around. And it was winter so the doors got frozen shut. I was heading to work one morning and literally could not get any of the doors open. Luckily it's a wagon, and I was able to crawl in through the hatch. During rush hour, in business casual, on a busy city street.

Last fall I was having intermittent starter problems. Usually okay but sometimes wouldn't start without jumping the solenoid. One time resulted in pushing the car across the Home Depot parking lot. Another happened when the starter simply came unplugged and I was 'stranded' at a gas station for a half hour. 

Fun times with old VWs.
