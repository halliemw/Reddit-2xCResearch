Classic victim blaming right here. People don't always plan for every situation and if your partner is loopy or out of it from drugs and you haven't already determined if sex in those conditions is okay *don't have sex*. You can wait until they're in their right mind and clarify before going ahead with anything. OP did nothing wrong. Her partner should have waited to establish consent when she wasn't on the drugs. 

You know what victims need? Support. Not a "harsh lesson to wisen them up". She did nothing wrong and her partner fucked up bad.
