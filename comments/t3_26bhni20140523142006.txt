> Can I ask how the public coming out went?

Kind of badly! All of my friends obviously already knew, and a lot of my Facebook friends are like... people from old internet forums I moderated and people from the Pride center at college, and I had no reason to think any of them would be anything but supportive.

But most of my family... they knew, too. But it's kind of like how they know that I'm a bisexual -- I bring it up and they get really mad, and then if it's not actually proof shoved in their faces they pretend I never said it. A few weeks ago my mom actually said "I'm so glad you're not gay anymore" ... ... ... and even with my responses like "I might propose to the next woman who lets me touch her boobs" she just kept kind of brushing me off and trying to end the conversation on the point that it was a phase that I'm over.

I was uninvited from family Christmas, and got in some very unpleasant fights with various family members including my mom.

More notably, my boyfriend was substantially bullied by his family, ranging from "enjoy the herpes" kinds of comments to "how does another man's dick taste on her pussy?". His mother sent out an emergency family email to like his great aunts. 

It's gotten a lot better now since everyone's mostly calmed down, but it was a *very* tough start.  My mom only last week finally acknowledged my boyfriend, and only in passing.
