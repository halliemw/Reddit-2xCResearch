This is actually an extremely good point. This happens to my boyfriend sometimes (he is getting mental health help, so no worries). I wonder what it really is, and what can be done to help? It's almost like being detatched.

I know my boyfriend lost his mother when he was very young, so there's that. Maybe something is making you detatched?
