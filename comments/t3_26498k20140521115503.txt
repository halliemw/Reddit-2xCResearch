Well that sucks! (I don't know you, so forgive me for dragging on,)

It's normal and it's okay to have worries and concerns about other women in your SO's life. However, you have to learn to recognize and ignore the irrational worries and talk to your SO about the legitimate concerns that you have when/if they occur. 

You're both going to have sexy dreams about other people, you're both going to check other people out and there will always be those lonely gents/ladies who see what you have with your SO and try to push their way in to take what the two of you have-we're all human-and eventually that stuff is going to happen. (So is the occasional 'dry' period when it comes to sex.) 

Ultimately you have to decide if your SO is worth it to put yourself out there-heart exposed, just like your SO has to make that same choice for you.

What has helped me with those fears is focusing on self-improvement as well as your SO. What do you want out of life? Is there a class you've always wanted to take? Do you have fun goals that you can do together like hiking, video games? Think about all the times where he made you smile or did something for you. Do something nice for him. (It doesn't have to cost anything.) Go do things together to build that trust up! Sex is great, but remember that having sex is only one aspect of being in a relationship-not the definition of having a relationship.

Talk to him about your concerns and fears and ask for his help on it. He might have some suggestions that might help out, who knows! 

Best of luck!
