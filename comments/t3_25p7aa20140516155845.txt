I stand corrected, I will edit post above.

That link is very interesting.  That would be tried and true good advice about thinking about sexuality on /r/sex, but here it didn't meet muster I guess.  I guess people concluded that the poster was mansplaining sexual orientation or something?  (If poster was even male... I see no evidence of it)
