Had mine for 5 years, had it taken out last week. Insertion was very fast, unlike you I had no cramping. I was concerned about the removal since the strings got tucked in, but the doctor found them and pulled it out. 

Mirena was great. Only downside is that it made my periods irregular. I'm hoping it'll be back to normal.
