I think its a bit odd for this subreddit to use the rantings of a mentally ill individual as a starting point to a serious conversation about sexism in society.

I do agree that there quite a lot of misogynistic views and sexism against women in society, particularly in the dating and PUA scene, but to use this as a launching pad into that kind of conversation is very crooked.
