It depends on the post, and why people are upset.

If they're upset that they have to stop and explain things to a someone, a tag like [no teaching] could let people know that we only want a discussion of the topic at hand in this post. If you have a question about something the OP said, ask it elsewhere. For example, if someone was trying to figure out what to do about their transphobic neighbor, and they were getting replies like "what is trans anyway?" or "why not just dress like a girl so they stop?"

If they're upset that someone is invalidating their opinion, then like someone else mentioned, that seems like it goes against the rules anyway. I've seen lots of posts where someone asks a questions like "my boyfriend said this, am I right to be mad?" So naturally, you get a lot of posts that say "yes, what a jerk" and some that say "no, think about it this way." No problems, people are discussing the topic and helping put things in perspective. But you get a problem when you see the no posts that go on to say something like "and you're stupid for even thinking that way." When it gets insulting or tries to invalidate, I feel that's just against rules 1 and 3. That's up to users to report, and mods to remove.

But some people seem really upset at the mere idea that men post here. Sure, sometimes guys derail things, but I feel like there's also been a vocal movement lately of women who are completely derailing things by always bringing up that they dislike the few guys who are disruptive. If people hate the idea that much, then I feel they could take it upon themselves to make a [women only] tag for their post. People who want everyone's opinion are free to enjoy 2X the way it is, people who are that worried about the "what about menz" comments don't have to get any more of those comments on their posts.
