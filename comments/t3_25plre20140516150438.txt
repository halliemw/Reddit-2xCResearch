Really depends how open minded people are. You're more likely to get someone from a -10 to a -8 if you give an argument from the 0 perspective as opposed to one from the +10 perspective, since a lot of people are just going to discredit the entire argument on the basis that they completely disagree. Few people will outright call someone a moron for thinking something that they strongly disagree with, but a lot of people surely think it.
