I've had one or two friendships like that. When I do click with people I tend to form very passionate friendships. I feel like my best friend and I still have this dynamic. We tried dating once, a long time ago, but it didn't really work. At the time it was because of my issues, but since then I've realized while I care about her a lot, I'm not attracted to her physically.


It was awkward for a while after we tried dating but now we're pretty much as close, or closer, than we ever were.


EDIT: Also, if it makes any difference, I'm straight. I'm open to trying relationships with women but so far I haven't met a woman I think I could really keep a relationship up with.
