Feelings are the result of poor judgments or bad reasoning or inappropriate premises. Feeling afraid because of a shadow you perceived as a spider is very appropriate, insofar as being afraid of a real spider is appropriate.

The fact that the spider was really a shadow doesn't make the fear wrong. What was wrong was the perception. More accurately, what was wrong was the mental habits that led to the perception (making assumptions, not double checking, not turning on the light, etc.). 

Feeling afraid when you perceive a spider is actually quite understandable and worthy of validation.
