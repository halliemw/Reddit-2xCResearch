I'm guessing some (no idea how many) of the people who masturbate on chatroulette are people who are turned on by other people seeing them. But when it's PMing a woman a picture of their penis because she commented on something with an opinion they disagreed with, I think it's more about making her uncomfortable so as to "put her in her place".
