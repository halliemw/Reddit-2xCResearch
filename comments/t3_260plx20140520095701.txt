I had a close friend from high school do something similar, she didn't ask me because I lived about 2 hours away and she didn't think I would be able to make it for the dress fittings and other wedding planning stuff....when wedding weekend rolled around I was the only one helping her with last minute preparations and whatnot. Afterwards she told me she wished that I had been a bridesmaid, because I was the only one who acted like one. 
Fast forward to my marriage ceremony, which was supposed to be myself, hubby, and our parents...a week before the ceremony my college friends decided they were going to all come to the photos and wear similar dresses to be my bridesmaids. I did not ask them, but I also didn't want to hurt their feeling and tell them no, which led to friends at home being upset they were not invited. 
Don't assume she doesn't feel the same way about you or that she really wanted these girls as bridesmaids, it really may have just been a matter of convenience or pressure from people she sees all the time. People have different ideas of what a "wedding" should be. It's very possible that someone is pushing her to do more than she wants to do. 
Try talking to her about it, ask if there is anything she needs help with. Just because you're not in a matching dress doesn't mean you can't still be there for her.
