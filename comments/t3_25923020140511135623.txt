Reading this posts and all the comments is really powerful for me. I'm nearly 27 years old and super hairy on my belly, face, and butt, and I always thought I was "abnormal." I never, *ever* saw other women with hair in the places I had it. I worry every day when I look at my fur, wondering what is wrong with me -- maybe I have some kind of disease! Maybe it's a hormone imbalance! Okay, my doctor says I'm healthy, so why am I defective?!

But there's nothing wrong or abnormal about me. Tons of the women commenting here have exactly the same body hair patterns I do. There is no reason for any of us to feel weird or isolated about our body hair, and the more we hear about and see other women like us, the happier we will be with ourselves. Fuck yeah. Thank you so much.
