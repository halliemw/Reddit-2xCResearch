I'm trying to remain optimistic. I'm hoping we can ride it out, the downvotes will die down when people get bored, and hopefully more good will come from this than bad. I think a lot of the issues we bring to light here are issues that men don't have to think about or never even knew existed -  maybe we can open their eyes, because frankly, being a woman is not easy. I've known a couple of men who really changed their tune about certain things (like for example, one of them is a gamer, and quite making rape jokes) after becoming friends with more girls.
