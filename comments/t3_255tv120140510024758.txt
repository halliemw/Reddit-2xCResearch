Thanks. Yeah, it has made me a bit wary of counsellors in general, my experience with her was so awful. At that point in time I really needed someone to tell me that I had to leave the relationship, not that it was something I could personally change. The fact that she is so high up in the NHS and clearly a well-regarded academic as well made me feel like she must know what she was talking about. It is something I'd like to try again though, I guess it's just about choosing the right person.
