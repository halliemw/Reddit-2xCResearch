This is an interesting complaint coming from someone who, right out of the gate, labelled OP's cap a "pro-rape ad". Also, you're the one who claimed that being from Wisconsin automatically gave you expertise on America, all evidence to the contrary. I just pointed out how clearly contradictory the assertion was.

>But I can continue to argue with you on the anatomical correctness of a graduation cap.

If you want to argue that the vagina doesn't end at the cervix, you go right ahead. But your beef is with a few millennia of collective anatomical wisdom, not with me.
