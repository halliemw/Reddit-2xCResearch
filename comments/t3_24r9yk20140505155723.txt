The thing is, even in a happy and "good" marriage, sometimes things do go tits up.  People are people, and married or not they make mistakes.  Just because you have a ring on your finger doesn't mean you're immune to horrible lapses in judgement, personal crisis, and unhappiness with other aspects of your life.  People get tempted by others, feel taken for granted, feel stuck in a rut.  Sometimes, that stuff goes bad.  Even in a seemingly solid relationship.  How you handle those things, what you will tolerate from your partner, and how you communicate will make the difference in whether things go on.

And people change and grow over time, always.  If you're both mature, compatible, and communicate well, then you will you change and grow together.  That's great, and beautiful. If you disagree on a lot of life things, don't talk through things, and aren't sure what you want in life, you will probably grow apart.  And while probably for the best, it sucks.

What builds a great relationship?

**Respect.**  Not taking what the other person does for you for granted, and acknowledging that, although they are half of your marriage, they are still their own person with thoughts and feelings and needs.

**Communication.**  Probably #1.  The other person cannot fix what they do not know is broken.

**Maturity.**  The ability to take responsibility for one's actions, and recognize that you are not the center of the universe.

**Compatibility.**  In values, beliefs, financial patterns, living patterns, and sex.  This is not the same as liking the same music and movies, though that doesn't hurt.

Boring things, mostly.  :P  Except for the sex.

edit: wrong "you're/your"
