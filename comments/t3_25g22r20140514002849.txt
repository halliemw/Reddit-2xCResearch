this freaks me out. I'm terrified that one day skipping periods will be determined to be bad for you, and may be detrimental for our health when we want to become pregnant one day. I'm so scared it will do something to my body and ill have trouble getting pregnant one day. so i refuse to skip periods, because i don't want any difficulties for when I'm ready to have behbehs down the road. I'm beyond jealous though that you've gone two years. like holy shit. SO JELLY.
