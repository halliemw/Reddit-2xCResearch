I don't believe that people who say they are pro-life necessarily judge someone who has an abortion. They may lament the loss of the child buut they don't necessarily judge the person. That's like syaing all pro-abortionists think all pro-life people are stupid or old fashioned-- it's a generalisation.



I'm glad you pointed out the difference between pro-choice and pro-life. I fear I was accidentally using them interchangeably in my head, though I do know the difference.



With regard to what you said about "considering the audience"- the point is that the "audience" of TwoX should not be of one opinion, like they seemingly are (the opinion that abortion is OK, and anyone who disagrees is bad or wrong or diverting our rights as women/humans).


What I'm trying to convey here is not because I am worried about being downvoted for an opinion. It's because I'm worried about the ramifications that pro-abortion may have on others, e.g. it may promote the belief that abortion is an acceptable alternative to using contraception, and gloss over some factors of abortion such as the still very present risks involved (like emotional and physical trauma) that don't seem to be discussed any more.

I mentioned the fact that people are downvoted for expressing anti-abortion opinions because this is a contributing factor to people not posting about other options and the risks/side effects of abortions, which by extension stops people from hearing as much about the negatives as they do about the so-called positives of abortions.
