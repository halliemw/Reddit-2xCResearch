*Literally no one* in this thread called it sexual assault. What it is is sexual harassment, and it's a pretty textbook example. If your "different point of view" is that sexually degrading comments made to coworkers is not sexual harassment, then I don't think we have to be tolerant of it.


Using your definition, nothing could ever be considered sexual or race-based harassment, because you could just claim "I don't dislike women or black people, I just hurl gendered and racial slurs at them because I'm an asshole!"
