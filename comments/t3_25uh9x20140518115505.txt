Not everyone has pain with their period, but if it happens, it's good to know what to do. Chances are your periods will change a lot over the next year or three, so don't worry too much if your next period is completely different from this one and the next one is completely different from everything else. Hopefully you continue to have very mild periods, but if you do have bad one here or there, you'll know how to handle it.
