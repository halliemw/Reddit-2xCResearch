Sounds good to me.  I figured my comments on how I sometimes feel victimized in this sub may make me some enemies.  Also I thought some may feel I am downplaying their situations by coming in as a male and sharing what may be similar situations to theirs.  I did it to highlight how sometimes we are in very much the same boat, but I didn't want to downplay gender issues nor specifics to any one persons situation.
