> His disdain for men appears to stem from his sense of entitlement to womans affections and subsequent hatred of them for not giving him what he wants.

There's another link in the chain in the reasoning though. He sees relationships as society's most important status symbol, which is why he feels entitled to them.

His feelings about women don't seem to suggest he deserves all women's affections. In fact he clearly expects women to dislike him and hurt him. He merely expects *a* woman's affections, and frequently speaks of frustration that men he deems far less worthy get affection and he does not.

> his whole attitude is about the fact that he is not getting what he deserves and is entitled to - which is relationships and sex from white women.

Oh, he thinks he's entitled to a lot more than that, and he admits that he focuses on that primarily because he has been universally rejected.

> Rodgers is half-white, but appears to only identify with that race

I can't imagine your basis for asserting that. At several points he describes himself as asian...

> Turns out, it's the majority of these cases.

I guess that depends on what you mean by "these cases". If you mean mass murders in the US, it sure isn't surprising that they are mostly young white males (guess who commits the majority of all violent crimes in the US?). As one would expect for such a broadly targeted attack, they do usually intend to be motivate to retaliate for real or perceived slights by a broad group of people, who they generally perceive as an "other" of some kind or another. So yeah, they tend to target the same groups that are generally found to be "the other" by everyone else in society, which sadly often divides along the lines of visible minorities. I'm not sure why that indicates anything or is in any way surprising.
