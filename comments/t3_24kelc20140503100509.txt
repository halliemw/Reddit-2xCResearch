It depends on what you mean by "oppressive."  A Western person might say that Iranian women are being "oppressed" because they are forced to cover their hair. 

But an Iranian person might say that Western women are "oppressed" because they are forced to live in a society where women are judged by their appearance and a "pornofied" culture is constantly bombarding women with unrealistic depictions of how they should look.  They might also say that women are oppressed by being constantly subject to catcalling, misogynistic "jokes," and clubs/bars where women are constantly groped, etc... That stuff, for better or worse, doesn't happen in Iran. 

I'm not saying one or the other is right, but I do think its more complicated than "women in the West are happy and free, women in the East are sad and oppressed."
