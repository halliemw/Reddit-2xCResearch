I would have to agree with this and have been in a similar situation.  It's not necessarily that their husbands would make a pass at OP, but it's the fear from the other women that their husbands will secretly think about her sexually and desire her more than them.  And chances are, they would.  A lot of men behave that way and it's damaging to a woman's self esteem.  What these women said was pretty rude, but I can understand it; It's an attempt to remove exposure to reduce risk.
