I would recommend drinking a lot of water because your urine will flush out your urethra to some degree.
Usually, if this happened to me, I would try to urinate immediately afterwards. Drink a lot of fluids!

The vagina is a close friend of your anus though, you should be fine, as they have and will be neighbors for a while.
