I am typically a size 12 shoe and 6'2" - Clark's has a lot of actually cute shoes sizes 10,11&12 - I can find something I feel good in instead of grabbing the only thing that fits. As for athletic shoes, I just buy from the men's dept. They usually have some gender neutral or just plain good looking shoes there. If she is too embarrassed to buy from there in-store (I was at her age) shopping online is the way to go.

I was already 6' at 13 and continually being asked if I had graduated high school when I was only graduating from middle school - tell her that everything gets better in a year or two when the boys catch up! That is what made me so self-conscious at her age - that I towered over the boys. I went from flats only ever to rocking heels when they finally hit puberty. 

There is not a lot you yourself can say - but what helped me was that my dad was always very 'girl power'! He loved it when I would beat my brothers/cousins in sports and just fostered a real sense of pride in who I was WITHOUT ever directly addressing my height. I played basketball (surprise surprise); and instead of watching the men's college team on TV my house always had the women's games on, and seeing such tall ladies kick ass all the time made me want to be like them so I started to embrace my height. It was all about the indirect approach for me.
