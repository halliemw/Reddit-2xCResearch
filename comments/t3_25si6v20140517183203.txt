For me, I do enjoy listening to others opinions regardless of their background. I was talking about only specific situation. The vast majority of the time, insightful opinions from any person are welcome. The main issue with accepting all insightful opinions all of the time is that sometimes the insightful opinions can be dismissive or less than relevant. 

These are the kinds of comments that twox has been seeing recently. If a poster talks about how obnoxious a guy at a bar is, some new posters may feel the need to point out that not all men are oblivious to social cues. While this is correct, it is dismissive of the original point. Or maybe someone may point out that that guy could have poor social skills, and that the proper response should be pity instead of anger. While this adds insight, it also invalidates the OPs emotions. This can occur regardless of gender, though most recently these commenters tend to be male.
