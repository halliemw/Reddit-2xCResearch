Definitely a counselor is the right move. He may be frustrated or feel that counseling is a sign that the relationship is doomed, but maybe try to communicate (i know, it's an issue) that you both need tools to help deal with this stressful time. Communicate how important it is that your relationship become a bedrock is stressful times, rather than another stressor.
