Totally! I went to a college where gel (well, back then it was acrylic because I was a starving student) nails were considered trashy and for a while I totally stopped getting them. Then a crazy Japanese-style nail place opened up near my hometown and I was like...fuck all y'all im getting 3D roses and gold chains and studs and quilting on ALL THE NAILS!
