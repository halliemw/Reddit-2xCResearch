I don't think this is like that at all. It's sort of shitty to look at someone else's experience and say they're making up how traumatic it is. People do make up stories, sure, but to accuse someone of that on the grounds of it seeming "forgettable at best" is weak. And what advantage is there to make up how harmful it was? OP is just sharing her story, and it's a self post so it's not like karma is involved. What she described, being groped and sexually touched, *is* traumatic, and it's a weird thing to accuse her of.
