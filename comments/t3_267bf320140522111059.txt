This is not true. The truth is what heatheranne said.

Let me pose it to you this way: let's assume you're left-wing. Think about right-wing groups that make you uncomfortable. Say Christians. They get the same exact treatment that feminists get. A small crazy vocal minority says outrageous, hateful things and the vast majority of nuanced, subtle, calm believers get stigmatized (pun intended) into a 'radical' group.

"Oh, you're one of those *Christians* who hate gays and women and want to take us back to the Stone Age?"

It happens to all groups.
