My mom went shopping for a new truck one time, and she knew exactly what she needed out of it. The sales guy kept trying to push one of those giant Tundra trucks on her, but she didn't want something that big. When she told him she wasn't interested in that one, the sales guy said "What? Your husband won't let you play with the big toys?" We left.
