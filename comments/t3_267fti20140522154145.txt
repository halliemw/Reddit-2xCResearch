While I do see what you're saying, I think that you're incorrect when it comes to a lot of cultures/religions. One reason a lot of outsiders may hold this incorrect belief is that in mainstream Western culture, it's very common for men to wear things like long sleeves and/or long pants in most situations, whereas it's less common for women to always wear long skirts and shirts that aren't low cut. But to take one random example: on the more conservative side of Orthodox Judaism, most women will not wear pants other than in very specific situations where it's really necessary, and women will not wear shirts that are low-cut, short sleeved, or sleeveless. Most men won't wear shorts or t-shirts in public. Married women will always wear a head covering of some sort when outside of their home, and men will wear one all the time other than when bathing, sleeping, etc. Those two dress codes are pretty much exactly the same in terms of strictness. But if you went to an area with many Orthodox Jews, you might see some men and think that (other than their head coverings) they were just wearing average male clothing, yet you would maybe notice that the women weren't wearing jeans and tank tops like other women in their area might be.
