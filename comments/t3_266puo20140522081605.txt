Don't do this!  You don't have to justify anything to her.  "I'm sorry, but I won't be able to be part of your wedding after all."  When she argues, just repeat friendly and sincere variations of "I'm sorry, it just won't be possible but thank you anyway."  Grrr!!  I can't stand All-About-Me brides.
