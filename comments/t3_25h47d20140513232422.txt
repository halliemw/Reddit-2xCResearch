I've gotten my share of "you should be glad someone even wants to talk to you" "is there something wrong with you?!" "Are you gay?!" (Because it is so incomprehensible that I would not want to have sex with you...?) And similar comments from girls I've said no to. As I said in another thread, it is easier to say that I've a gf (which is the truth anyway)

Some girls, especially when drinking, seem to think that men are penis-holders waiting to be graced by their presence. And it is almost like they are shocked when someone does _not_ want to have sex.

My advantage as a man though, is that I don't have to think "sexist, idiot or both?" I know that idiot is the right answer every time.
