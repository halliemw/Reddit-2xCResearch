Yessss!!! All of these things. You'll be ok. The first few days are the worst. But time really does heal. Focus on the positive things you have and how amazing it feels to remember that you can live a wonderful life on your own!! You are strong. Don't beat yourself up for your emotions. But don't let them overcome you. Keep in mind that they are only temporary. And make sure you have someone really awesome and supportive in your life who knows what you're going through (like your mom). I wish you luck.
