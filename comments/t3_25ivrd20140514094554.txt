This could've been written by my ex. I ended a relationship in which I was cheated on and emotionally abused. After these things happened he would demand that I "get over it." If I was upset I was being "sour" or "cruel". Like the author in this piece, my ex felt that my hurt was an offense to *him*.

When I finally left he pulled the same shit as this guy. He even said something along the lines of how I use to be kind and open but now I was callous. He had zero concern for how emotionally draining it was to be around him. How the only way I could get over his emotional abuse was to get away from him.

Men like this live in their own world, no one matters but themselves. Yes, of course the cut off hurts. But people rarely cut exs off for no reason. It just doesn't register to these guys that they hurt their girlfriend. To them a woman having her own hurt is tantamount to abusing them.
