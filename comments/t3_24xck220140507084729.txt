You seemed to have some very misinformed ideas about abortion. 

> the idea of abortion being used as birth control is become more acceptable,

That's just not true.  There is absolutely no evidence of that. 

Birth control is the easiest, cheapest, and most convenient option. No one in their right mind would choose abortion over using birth control.  

> But can we relly say that abortion is safer than birth?

Yes, we can. All scientific evidence we have points to this conclusion.
