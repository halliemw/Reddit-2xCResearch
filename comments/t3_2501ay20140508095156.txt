See I don't get this. Why not do exactly what you're suggesting... With the phone recording in the pocket. Just so he admits he took the pic without permission out loud and explicitly. During a calm conversation where she tries to appeal to his reason and humanity. (Given that he already sees he body as something he can photograph at will my guess is his humanity is hard to get a hold of).

I don't understand your objection, particularly if he doesn't know he is being recorded.
