Thanks! We have discussed how it would be easier if sex wasn't the immediate goal - that I need sometime to get used to it again, and it's a bit overwhelming jumping in full throttle. Also how logistically it's difficult to cuddle and let things evolve when we're never in bed (awake) at the same time. He agreed he could come to bed sometimes before he's sleepy, just to let this happen - but it definitely still feels like he's there with a purpose and that I can't just cuddle with him and fall asleep.
I do need to re-boost my confidence in this zone - weirdly has not been an issue since I was like 18 and had no idea what was going on. I'm not sure how I backslid!
