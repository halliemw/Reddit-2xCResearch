This is the disconnect. I see nothing wrong with advocating what potential crime victims can do to protect themselves. I also don't think "x should minimize risk" is the same thing as saying "x is at fault for not minimizing their risk." Both those statements are completely different. If anything, we need more awareness of what victims can do to prevent crime from happening to them across the board. We've all heard "lock you doors" before. I don't take offense to that. It's a step I can take to prevent a break-in. 

As far as rape prevention, I never said women shouldn't wear short skirts, I feel people think I'm somehow implying that. That simply isn't the case. I never discussed details of what people could do to protect themselves. If I did, it would have been more practical, like don't get sloppy drunk while surrounded by strangers. That's good advice for everyone.

I was on vacation once in New Orleans. It was late at night and I was on my way back to the hotel. A police officer called out and stopped me. I was instructed not to return to my hotel on the route I was going. It was a busy tourist section by day, but by night it was dangerous. That's prevention. He may have saved my wallet or my life. I don't resent that. I didn't say "shame on you, you should be after the bad guys instead."

I know rape prevention doesn't work in all cases. But sometimes people put themselves in dangerous circumstances that can be avoid. That's all I was saying, no more and no less. My comments weren't even about rape specifically. I feel many didn't read what I had written and instead attempted to read between the lines, searching for something that was not there.
