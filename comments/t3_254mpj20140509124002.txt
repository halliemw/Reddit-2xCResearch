I just wanna give you a hug, what a bummer situation! I'm sorry that your nurse wasn't very thoughtful. But maybe you can take solace in the fact that healthcare professionals have seen far far worse than menstral blood. There's really no reason you should feel embarrassed, you had literally no control over the situation! 

How are you now?
