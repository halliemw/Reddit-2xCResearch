Aaagh the "protecting" thing makes me want to barf! I've had guys say stuff like that to me too (but the opposite).  
It's funny, I have a friend who looks like a tall gorgeous supermodel, so I'm super jealous of her. But she says the same things you just said and wishes she was my height. I guess the grass is always greener...
