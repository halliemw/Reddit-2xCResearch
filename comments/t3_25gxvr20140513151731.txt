I think you have to distinguish between strength of character and strength *as* a character. When I say more strong women would be great, I'm not just referring to characters who are strong emotionally, physically, etc. In *that* sense, Batman is a strong character. He deals with all the tough shit, he's physically tough, etc. But nobody would ever really call Batman a "strong character", because he's just not that interesting and compelling in most iterations. Ledger's Joker was a strong character, because he stole the scenes and was interesting. Yeah, he was an asshole, but a strong character doesn't have to be a good guy.

Batman has great strength of character, but very little strength *as* a character. What is his emotional state? Why should I care what his emotional state is? What are his goals? What does he want to do once he saves Gotham? It's hard to become invested or to care about a character with so little characterization.
