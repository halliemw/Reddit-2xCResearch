Not true, and also, I'm answering you to make sure you are aware of how toxic you are being so that maybe you can check yourself around others in the future. I've actually taken a look through your comment history though, and I resend telling you that you seem to give good advice. You obviously don't and some of the karma ratings on your comments reflect that quite plainly, much like they do here. Also, telling me to argue less here and more out there, is no kind of advice. Others on here have given thoughtful answers. You on the other hands, seem to constantly give comments under the guise of advice used to talk to others about how you think you are a superior human being above other women. This subreddit has no need or use for people like you.
