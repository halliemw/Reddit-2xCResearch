I don't like it when women breast feed in public. I also don't like it when people eat in public for the exact same reason. I think anywhere you can eat a hamburger you should be allowed to breastfeed, that is to say please go somewhere private, I don't want to see either of it. 

I however get that I am just a negative person and bothered by it. My general rule is anywhere you can eat a sandwich you should be able to do anything else, I don't have to like it.
