tell her "thank you" for not letting you get worried. tell her that you love her, and that you are a stronger person because she guided you through life. let her know that you appreciated her work on raising you, and that you will continue to be the strong woman that she helped raise you to be. 

when you get close to death, you accept that you are going to die, and you are okay with dying. you just worry that you haven't done enough for other people. let her know that she has done enough, and that you will miss her but it won't destroy your life. let her know that you will remember her, but the memories you have of her will be fond memories. 

DON'T act like it will be the end of the world. that is a terrible thing to do to a dying person who can't chose to live. she probably wants you to live on and be happy, so assure her that you will.
