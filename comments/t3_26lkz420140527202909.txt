OMG these comments are friggen hysterical!!!!!!! Yea, once you call an asshole out for being an asshole it's glorious!  I had one project I was placed on with an airport because I'm female with a latin last name so I met two "minority' requirements for that specific contract at the time.

This huge 6'7" burly type dude had been eyeing me up a few days.  I knew it was a matter of time.  So he finally approaches me. I see my team nudge each other.. they see it's about to go down and stood by to watch. 

The guy who, against my 5'0" frame towered over me.  At this time I was in a very horrible divorce.  I'm also not new to the scene - I grew up in this industry. 

He asks me "So, who did you have to blow to get this job?".   I walk up to him. "How mutha fucking stupid is your ass?!!!! If you knew ANYTHING about anything, and in a union as I know you are, that I didn't have to fucking blow anyone.  How did I get this job? Good old fashioned nepotism.  Now, if that's too much of a fucking big word for you, I suggest you ask your boss, and mind you my family is Sicilian".

I look over and my team is giggling/laughing so hard my one uncle was in tears and cramped over.

He, Mr. Burly dude, was transferred the next day.

Do not be afraid to call out an asshole for being an asshole.
