It's where the baby feeds repeatedly/constantly for a considerable length of time. I know it doesn't sound bad, but it's so draining and stressful. Usually, the second you take away your boob the baby just screams and screams until you put it back on. 

You can't give it pumped milk or formula to keep it happy because the point of cluster feeding is that it signals your body to make more milk to meet the baby's demands. 

It's worth persevering, because after about six weeks it stops. It really is tough though.
