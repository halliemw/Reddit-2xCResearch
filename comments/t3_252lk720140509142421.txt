We are fairly different than Saudi Arabia. In about a million different ways.

The thing I always try to express to people (and I suppose this can apply to Saudi Arabia, too) is that the people of a country ARE NOT represented by those who run the country. People are super relaxed and chill here, and they love Americans. You know, there are a lot of women here who voluntarily CHOOSE to wear a full *chadoor* (the long black thing that covers everything but their face,) but a lot of them don't give a shit about what other people wear. I mean, it depends on what part of the country you're in, too. Isfahan is A LOT more conservative than Shiraz, but that's like anywhere else in the world.
