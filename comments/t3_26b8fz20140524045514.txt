/u/Deimorz,

I would be interested to know the ratio of "false flag" harassment reports to "legitimate" harassment reports. 

I might be guilty of reading too much into your statement, but phrases like "quite a few" accounting for a "large amount"  of harassment, and "not trying to say that there hasn't been **any** harassment" sort of make it sound like a considerably large percentage of these reports are fabricated. Are you talking about a sizable minority, a majority? 

I understand you pretty much said you were not trying to be dismissive, but your overall tone does seem vaguely dismissive.

So what are the numbers of false reports vs. legitimate reports, to the best you know? I imagine this information would be fine to post, since you called out OP (appropriately so). 

I think that the administration attempting to give a quantifiable breakdown of these items would be extremely beneficial to future discussion. 

-Respectfully
