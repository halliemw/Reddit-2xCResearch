Yes, I'm obviously so stupid I desperately need you to explore to me. 

I don't care what the point if the article is. First of all it was written abysmally and was borderline painful to read. Secondly, that dress is ugly. It is designed terribly and she did herself no favors in wearing those awful shoes with it.  That's her prerogative though and if she felt beautiful in it, good for her. 

Personally, I think she looks awful and it's a shame because had the dress been tailored to flatter her figure, she could of looked stunning. Unfortunately that dress looks awful, the cut of it is so completely unflattering that I'm left to wonder if she knows exactly what she was doing and wore it simply so people would be talking about her, as no publicity is bad publicity and people who otherwise have no clue who she is are talking about her.
