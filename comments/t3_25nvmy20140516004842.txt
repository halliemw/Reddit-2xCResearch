I meant op as in the original commentator of whom you replied to. I understand your point and I too have no reasonable rebuttal as to why you're wrong, frankly because you're not wrong. I'm simply saying that if you want your opinion to be respected and held to as intelligent and insightful, you should just refrain from using (rather lazy and immature, by the way) insults such as calling someone a retard. it completely eradicates your position and loses a lot of respect from your peers, such as myself. 

just a tip anyway. keep doin you big blue!
