/r/relationships would have more advice but here's mine: 

Regardless of whether your bf and his ex are just friends, her asking him if he'd like a lap dance is an inappropriate conversation topic between platonic friends. His reply is also inappropriate. 

You shouldn't snoop on your boyfriend either. If you can't bring yourself to trust him then don't date him.
