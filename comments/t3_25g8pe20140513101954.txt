while I agree with the thrust of the article via a vis educating girls it should be noted that Boko Haram means "western education is sinful" in a non-gendered way and that before the girls were abducted they killed and burnt over a hundred school age boys alive while allowing the girls to escape - people only started to care when they stopped focusing on boys.
