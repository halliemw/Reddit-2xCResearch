This is entirely my experience:

1. My period is really regular now and always happens on the Wednesday that I take the placebo pills.
2. I only had crappy cramps 1/2 of my periods on average, and now I only get them maybe on 1/5 of my periods.
3. Nobody else has ever talked about this with birth control, so maybe I'm weird. My periods are now much, much lighter, usually involve only the darker, nastier black/brown blood, and smell a lot worse (only if you put your face in it, you can't smell it outside my pants or anything). This is *awesome* because I no longer get anemia from the blood loss once a fricking month.

You can always skip the placebo pill week and not have a period, but I haven't tried that.
