I don’t think its entitlement; I think it’s a defence, a Parthian Shot if you will. It probably took a shit load of courage to make that approach, and his guts were just ripped out in a second. Chucking that barb was the best he could do to divert the embarrassment of total humiliation and failure and finding out lowly ranked he is in life’s mating game.

Now I’m not defending it, if anything it just exposes how poorly ranked the guy really is in the game; I just don’t think it’s an entitlement reaction.
