Yes, definitely! I agree with *everything* you said haha.

I was afraid that people would interpret what I wrote as "hairy women shouldn't shave anything because it's more beautiful", which isn't true or false. It's a matter of preference. I would just hate for a woman to feel obligated to be totally hairless if it doesn't feel right for her, and then proceed to feel poorly about herself because of how she looks naturally.
