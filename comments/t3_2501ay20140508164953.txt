In the US, single vs all-party consent applies only to audio, because it's part of our federal wire tapping laws. Photographic privacy is governed by a completely different set of laws which don't have the same consistency between states, but as a general rule, if a person is nude in private (even if the privacy is not in their own home), taking a photograph of them is not okay.
