That's really not so bad.  But super-pluses aren't significantly bigger than a plus, and they really do hold a lot more.  I highly recommend them for getting through the night (with a panty liner for that stand-up-and-run-to-the-bathroom experience when you wake up in the morning).  On my heavy days, super-pluses last about 4-5 hours... and pluses only last 2-3 hours if I'm lucky.
