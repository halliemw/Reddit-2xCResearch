I really hurt a boyfriend's feelings once telling him that I thought penises looked weird.  He was very proud of his, and couldn't understand how I couldn't agree.  Nothing against it, really, and I liked what he did with it, but yeah - genitals look weird, and it took me a while to get used to what the other bench was packing.
