I think it's great you're trying to participate in the community, but sexual pleasure is something I could explore in r/sex.  There's a weird shift in perspective I'm to wrap my head around, if you could contribute in a way closer the spirit the question?  If possible, if you post in the future, please consider the point of twox.  

Please allow me help if you're not seeing the female perspective.  Imagine being a gatekeeper charged with protecting a village from an invader, you've done it for decades.  Everyday you have to lock the gate, when visitors come occasionally there's a whole procedure to make sure they're safe.  Even when you're not working as a gatekeeper it changes the way you act, see things, dress, talk.  Suddenly one day you're out of a job, the village has decided they want the invaders in! In fact it would be treated like a miracle if they decided to invade.  How would you feel suddenly having to switch?

But yes. It's good to know it feels nice for boys to come.
