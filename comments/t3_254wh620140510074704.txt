I'm glad to hear that. I think this is definitely something that we need to be thoughtful about, and I think that it meshes with the point in the first post about tolerance vs support: for as long as this sub is a default, we need to step up the defense and support of any woman we see targeted here.

Will things change? Yes, inevitably, and I can't really say I agree with the decision to make 2XC a default. But I also think we are stronger than that as a group, that we can adapt and face new challenges without giving in to or condoning problematic behavior.
