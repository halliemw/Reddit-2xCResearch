I love going to the range, esp when no one else is there (haha!). It gets a little crazy when our local range is full and it takes 20 minutes for people to call a "cold range" so i can go check my target, but I am learning that half of shooting is waiting.  
I hope you have a great time at the range tomorrow! We went last weekend and I practiced with my Ruger 9mm pistol (so in love with it).
