Samipearl19 is completely right! She's addicted to it and she will not change until she makes the decision herself. 

I have a friend who just won't stop getting herself into these situations. She's knows exactly what she's getting herself into, but that doesn't deter her. Neither will any common sense that I present her with. She's addicted to the drama of the toxic relationship. She will not let it go until she is ready. Unfortunately this has driven us apart. She became so selfish that she started ruining dates that I had with my bf because she needed to talk. She interrupted precious time with my family. She is totally wrapped up in herself.

I've been in her exact position though so I get it. In high school I had a very toxic relationship. It was very dramatic and we'd be constantly breaking up and getting back together and fighting and making up. No matter how much I knew that he was bad for me I couldn't help myself. I was a pain because I couldn't stop talking about him to my friends either. I could feel my friends getting annoyed with me. 

I had pretty dramatic relationships in college too, but luckily I grew out of it. I honestly think it comes down to maturity. At some point you realize you're sick of playing games or trying to mend a broken relationship. You realize you deserve much better and that you're finally ready for something real and stable. Hopefully your friend will realize this soon. In the meantime I wish you luck OP. I know how hard it is to deal with these kinds of friends.
