Yeah you're right, I'm sure it will take a while to stop missing him so much. The way it ended was very traumatic for everyone involved and it was a massive shock for me, it left me feeling completely powerless. Not the way I wanted things to happen, but I guess it was the wake up call I needed.

I'm glad you're doing well now, that's really encouraging to hear :)
