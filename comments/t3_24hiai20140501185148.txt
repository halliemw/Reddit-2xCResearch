Your problems DO NOT sound immature at all. I think you've already got really good advice from /u/letsgetknockedup listen to her! She's right!

I'm sure you don't want to be back at the hospital, hospitals suck. But it's better than getting worse. When I had my son I was pretty badly postnatally depressed and I made the only medical professional I spoke to about it swear that she wouldn't tell my doctor or anything because I didn't want to be on prozac, or in a program, or anything like that. I deeply regret that, because I had more than a year of my life that was almost wasted because it was under this cloud all the time. I told myself I would sort myself out but I couldn't. I needed the help. You might not even have to go back to hospital, there might be outpatient options.

Your problems seem insurmountable now but they are not. Don't be angry at yourself but go and get whatever help you need. People are happy to help, believe me. Lots of people care about you (including me, from far away over the internet) and lots of people are here to ask for help (again, including me). Look after yourself xxx
