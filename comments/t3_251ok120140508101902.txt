Well I just got this reply to a message to mods (it did specifically say I was considering leaving, so it's not like they're shoving people out), I think I'm out:

>There were a couple of reasons we didn't float it by the community beforehand, the most important of which was that there wasn't enough time. We didn't find out it could happen until a little while before you, really.
>We decided to become giving a default a shot to help people who might need us discover us more easily. Yes, it opens us up to more trolls and malevolent denizens of the internet, but if the community keeps hitting that report button, everything will stay relatively under control.
>We'll be sorry to see you go, but its your prerogative.

Given the timing constraints I'm still disappointed they made the decision without asking 2X. But I'm much more disappointed by the lack of mod response now.
