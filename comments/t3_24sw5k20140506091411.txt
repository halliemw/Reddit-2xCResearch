Thank you. I know that is what I need to focus on - me. I'm definitely feeling the upheaval. I feel so lonely and betrayed I'm just trying to cope with those emotions.  But deep down I know I'm not ready or capable of another relationship right now. I loved him so much that I can't even contemplate even seeing someone else casually. And that is part of what stings. He never loved me enough to feel that way. He was fully capable of not just sleeping with someone else but jumping into a committed relationship less than two weeks after he looked me in the face and said he knew we had something special, that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me.  I know that is clearly a lie now but it still seriously stings.
