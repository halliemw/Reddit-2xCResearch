I don't know if it would be considered appropriate by the reviewer's standards, but I personally don't think it would be fair if one group of people (from good homes) can talk about where they come from while another group cannot. I don't enjoy the idea that people who have suffered are encouraged to never talk about it.


 I also think it would be fairly obvious if you were simply trying to guilt the reviewer into scoring your essay highly. Colleges like resilient, hard working applicants, and overcoming a dysfunctional home while maintaining great grades and being involved in school activist groups proves just that.

**edit** I think that if you decide to write about such things, you should take care to not be graphic. Just say enough to get your point across.
