I've had Paragard for about a year and a half. Pre-Paragard I was happy with my light flow for three days. Now I leak through an ultra tampon every hour AND my period lasts 5-7 days. I don't have spotting in between, just the day before my period comes. I was a depressed zombie mess on hormonal BC, so I guess I can put up with a heavy flow over depression and whatnot.
