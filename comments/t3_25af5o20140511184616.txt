That is so cool! My mom passed away from stomach cancer when I was 10, she was only 33. She kept regular journals and the last time I was at my dads (couple yrs ago), I read through the ones she wrote while pregnant with me and right when I was born. I bawled like a baby. It's been 16 yrs, and I miss her every fucking day. Holidays are still difficult, and now I have my daughter, and it's hard bc she would have been an amazing grandma.
