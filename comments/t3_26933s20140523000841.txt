The boss didn't have to point out and explicitly state which women he found attractive. If that were the topic of conversation, then it's relevant and whatever. But if he's interrupting other people to point the women out, then it's rude. Even without interrupting an other person, if someone behaves like this too often, then they begin to cross a line into inappropriately over-sexualizing others or sexual objectification. To me, the line between finding someone sexually attractive and over-sexualizing/objectifying them, on the personal level, is all about tact.
