As someone who is sort of in the same boat as you are right now (though I don't have my shit together nearly as much as you do), this is something I think about a lot. When I start wondering why I do anything that I do, and why I feel so unfulfilled with my life as a whole, I force myself to think back to very blissful moments in my life, and think about what made them so amazing. I've come to realize that the things that give me true, in-the-moment happiness are actually more simple than I ever thought they would be... I enjoy the sun, nature, helping other people, teaching, really good food, really good coffee, really good books, one-on-one conversations with close friends, etc. So, I try to keep these things in my life, even if for just an hour everyday. I certainly don't feel ecstatic all the time, but I guess I just like having some little go-to habits that can bring me a bit of insta-happiness during my search for those larger things that supposedly bring a more long-term happiness? Haven't quite figured it all out yet, unfortunately :)
