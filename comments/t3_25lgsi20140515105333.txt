I'm feeling the same way. I approach everything with the force, organization, and willpower of, as you said, a military action. As if I can be stubborn and strong enough to make these years pass as quickly and smoothly as I want them too. My boyfriend recently reminded me that we still have the summer together, and the more we plan and talk and worry, the less energy we're devoting to being present in the moment together. That really was what made it click for me- being rigorous isn't going to make this easier or more fun for either of us.
