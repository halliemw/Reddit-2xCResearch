I don't think it's understood, the gravity of referring her to a therapist behind her back. Who knows what other issues are going on, especially if she has a history of issues? What if she was involuntary committed? 

She's an adult. Filing a police report is one thing, but getting into her personal life and schedule with a therapist is irresponsible. What if I heard that OP was sick, and scheduled a doctor's exam? Kind of invasive, right? It's not for OP to decide what her cousin does beyond keeping her safe and away from any abuse, which is pushing my moral boundaries as it is.

>Tell whoever is her guardian

OP didn't state any ages, so she's probably responsible for her own health, as she should be.

Best that OP let's police unravel the situation before running around like a chicken with her head cut off, talking to therapists or family. She was sent some texts, FFS.
