**Do not let him shame you** for snooping; yes you violated his trust but in the words of Dan Savage (who I know is problematic in many ways but has good things to say on this point):


> "I've looked through my boyfriend's e-mail; I assume he's looked through mine. I've scrolled through his text messages; I assume he's scrolled through mine. Expecting your partner not to snoop is like expecting your partner not to fart or fantasize about other people. It's a nice thought ... but knowing what we know about human nature—and knowing that we ourselves snoop, fart, and fantasize about other people—it's a little unrealistic.

While your actions were a little shitty they violate a small trust, whereas his actions (or in this case words) violate a major one. Additionally, his immediate defensiveness and "storming off" makes me think he is probably full of bullshit regarding the "jerking around" and deflecting attention.

Don't fall for it. Stick to your guns and call bullshit. 



**TL;DR:** Your bf is full of shit and you shouldn't feel too bad.
