This might sound harsh, but given that you have a history with ED, I suggest you get out of this relationship now. If you want to help him, then make it clear that his health is a priority for you, and that bulimia is a deal-breaker. I know what recovery is like, and even if you love someone, your own health has to come first. His own disordered eating will affect you, whether you want it to or not. Please please please be assertive about this: Either he gets help or you walk. Trying to take on the burden of his care can only exacerbate your own issues!
