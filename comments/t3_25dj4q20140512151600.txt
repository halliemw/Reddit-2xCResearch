I completely agree. To be honest I would have handled this a lot better if my friend was just straight up with me and apologized.  It wouldn't excuse his behavior but I would still respect that he is willing to own up to his actions and we could both move on, no further input needed.  The fact that he has been ignoring me and brushed it off to my boyfriend as a misreading of my boyfriend's intentions rather than an unwarranted advance on his part to me shows that he doesn't feel sorry and isn't going to apologize sincerely to either of us.
