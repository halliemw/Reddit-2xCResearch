Classes tend to be socializing mediums for many people. People don't want to seem uncool, ruining their dating lives, and how their friends see them. This isn't as shallow as it seems. When you're pursuing a friendship or romantic interest, you should tread softly on things easily misunderstood. So I'd cut those students some slack, they are there to learn after all.

But that wasn't the main point of your post. I'm glad you reconsidered what feminism means to you and I hope you continue to reconsider everything you learned, and that it all leads to what you want in life. Great post.
