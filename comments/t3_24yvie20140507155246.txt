Ah, damn. I'm seeing that instagram lightly obscures direct hotlinking to pictures/finding direct image links. If any, that actually works for your side! So don't worry *too* much about your pictures showing up somewhere else.

> because I don't know how else to delete the comments 

If you log into http://instagram.com and then access your own pictures you can see a small "x" when you hover over people's comments! That should delete them. But always, always report every comment/account before deleting it so the instagram user service knows what's up.

> I did a quick google search of my username and nothing showed up

And if you wanna do a real thorough check, you copy your exact instagram username into google and place quotes around it. Like "my_awesome_account" - if you haven't already done that.

Woot! And congratz on graduating, lovely! I also tutored first semesters once. But the only thing that happened were the cute 19 year old boys wanting to add me on facebook afterwards - what I politely declined.

My other experience comes from having an online stalker randomly popping up every 2 years or so when he gets bored. So I know how to keep a tight lid on any online presence for 9 years now. *sigh*
