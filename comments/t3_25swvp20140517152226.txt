Here's my perspective, RampagingKittens

People have always used appearance as a proxy of internal qualities and it is impractical to change that.

Overweight people usually do not spend time working out, be selective of what they eat, and generally lack self-control (I was slightly overweight but have lost 20 lbs since then) While this is not necessarily true because genetics play some role, it is thought to be accurate enough on average and that's why we see fat people being judged nowadays.

Lawyers and bankers can be perceived as incompetence or untrustworthy by clients if they don't dress in business formal. Would you trust your doctor/lawyer/financial advisor if he/she dresses like a hobo or a hooker?

These things do not reflect their competence at all but are commonly used by people to judge others' characters. It is impractical for everyone to really get to know you, and using appearance is way more convenient because it only takes a second. Shallow? Yes. But it works fine enough in today's society. You can disagree with me but that doesn't make it less true.
