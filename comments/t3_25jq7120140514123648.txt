That's interesting as I hadn't considered people dropping the term due to outsiders misrepresenting it. It does make me curious about how common an occurrence it is. 

The (admittedly few) times I've seen something posted about no longer affiliating with feminism, it was framed as being due to internal pressure, not external. But yes as your initial question alludes to it's still possibly an incorrect assumption that it's not the fringe exerting that pressure, simply because outliers tend to be more vocal.
