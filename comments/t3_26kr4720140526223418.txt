Facebook is not helping, that's for sure. My best friend is getting married in three weeks and I'm definitely suffering from wedding envy (even though I have a great SO and we've agreed to postpone ours until after we're financially independent and I'm out of school).

That's probably part of it - I feel like a child because I can't support myself.
