I think this is something that only, like, trans or otherwise gender-bendy people really *feel*, and people who feel no disconnect between their sex and their gender tend not to feel very strongly. You just kinda... are a gender.

I don't feel super strongly that I'm a woman, because that's never something that's really been challenged for me. I've never had people telling me that I was a man when I felt like I was a woman, or whatever. People call me she and her, I have boobs and a vagina, and none of that has ever been super important to my identity. So it's very hard for me to really feel super attached either way.

But then I think about how weird it would feel for me if everyone suddenly did start calling me he, referring to me as a dude, and if I suddenly had a dude's body. That would be weird! People would be wrong, and my body would be wrong, and that would be super uncomfortable for me. Suddenly, my gender would be very important to me, because suddenly it would be something that I needed to deal with. 

So... yeah. I don't know. I think gender is kept up there in your brain somewhere with the rest of your consciousness, and we certainly know almost nothing about that yet, as a species. I mean, where, precisely, in your brain, is your internal thought process? We don't know that yet. We probably can in the future, science just hasn't caught up to that yet. I figure gender is something similar. And since I am not a neuroscientist, I'm pretty much just waiting for science to figure that shit out.

But until then, gender is pretty much as nebulous as just, you know, *feeelings*. But people seem to know anyway. So I just take people's word for it. If someone says they're a woman, then they'd know better than me, so like... yeah, that's a good enough definition for me. Self-identification. Works for me.
