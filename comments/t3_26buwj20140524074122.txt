Try to explain to your aunt that you understand that she wants to help, but that she's just making things worse. If people who try to help can't take that they're doing more damage than good and adapt their behavior, their main objective is to make themselves feel good, not to help.

As for the two guys, they're really just assholes. Who you are is not the problem; if anything, you settled for them because you needed to feel someone else's interest. We accept the love we think we deserve. It's not your fault they're idiots. The way they treated you is **not** your fault. Nothing would justify treating you like they did.

And you should consider reporting that assault.

But what do your parents *do*? For years I felt like my mom was disappointed in me until I realized that we didn't understand one another, that she couldn't see where I was going. She has the kind of best friend relationship with my sister, and I felt like I was nothing compared to it, until I realized that they're just more compatible, personality-wise. It's definitely not fun to see unfold, but how your parents make you feel is not necessarily how they feel about you.
