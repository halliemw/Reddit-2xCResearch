There's a wide misconception about what feminism means.  Anyone who has studied feminism, or even read the freaking wikipedia page, will be able to gather that it's a complex subject with a long, long history.

Shailene Woodley is a 22-year-old who does seem like a smart young woman.  But take into account that she has a high school education and has probably never taken any gender studies classes.  The only times we ever talked about feminism at my high school were when we discussed the suffragette movement and Roe v. Wade.  What are the chances that she's picked up a big on feminism?  Just given her definition of feminism as, the "idea of â€˜raise women to power, take the men away from the power,'" it's clear she has no idea what it means.  She says there should be balance.  She says everyone is 50% feminine and 50% masculine.  If someone laid out the facts for her--that the vast majority of feminists are pro-equality, not pro-women/anti-men--there's a good chance she might identify as feminist.  

I don't think that Time Magazine should be asking anyone if they're a feminist without making sure they know what it means.  Sure does make a nice headline, though.
