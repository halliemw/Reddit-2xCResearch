Yeah, I'm a contractor's assistant and wood refinishing specialist, and also a 23 year old girl. Subcontractors won't give me the time of day (especially over the phone) most of the time. I call them up, go through my precisely honed script, speak confidently, tell them the name of the company I work for, and use industry terms, and they blow me off. My boss calls the same people, and they'll schedule a time to come out within a few minutes. It's really frustrating, because I usually did all the research and scheduling, and he'll have to ask me about it anyway. Concrete guys are the worst for this. Flooring companies, however, are always fine with talking to me. It's weird!
