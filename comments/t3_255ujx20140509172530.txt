I would ask that you try to be a little less cynical, and maybe ask a question before assuming that you think you know something about me. This isn't just a coincidence.

I have had and increasing number of migraines in the past few years.  After trying different treatments, which haven't really worked, my doctor suggested I keep a journal. That few months have presented a pattern of these migraines...pointing to menstrual related symptoms,which I then started to research.  Since it is difficult to treat (normal migraine treatments have been shown not to work on  catamenial migraines so /r/migraine might not be the best source) I was hoping for some suggestions from other women who may suffer from this as well.
