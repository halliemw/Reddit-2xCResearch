Yeah I looked up some websites and I found that in some states, the minimuim wage can be as low as $15000. That is insanely low and I don't see how people like this can afford all the costs of keeping a house (even renting) as well as the costs of having a family. Single parents must hate the end of each month just before pay day. Not to mention the holidays and birthdays.
