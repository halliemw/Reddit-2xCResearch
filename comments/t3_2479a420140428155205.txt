I agree.  This is a very oddly constructed article, but I do appreciate the simplicity and elegant of the "five stages of men understanding sexism " thing: 


1. Sexism is a fake idea invented by feminists

2. Sexism happens, but the effect of “reverse sexism” on men is as bad or worse
3. Sexism happens, but the important part is that I personally am not sexist
4. Sexism happens, and I benefit from that whether or not I personally am sexist
5. Sexism happens, I benefit from it, I am unavoidably sexist sometimes because I was socialized that way, and if I want to be anti-sexist I have to be actively working against that socialization
