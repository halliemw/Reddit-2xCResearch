> /r/feminism is run by MRAs

wait, what?

Granted, I don't hang out there much - but I do hang out in the offshoot, /r/AskFeminists - I assumed that since ask was legit, the original would be, too. The links seem legit, the downvotes consistent with the brigading I assumed would go on... Can you clue me in, please?
