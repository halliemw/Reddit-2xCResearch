There are 50 subreddits that are "default." The top posts for these 50 are amalgamated into a feed visible to anyone who goes to reddit.com without an account (or with an account unless they customize their subsriptions). This subreddit is one of those 50. The feed is called "the front page."

By "front page" he means that twoxchromosomes now is visible to anyone without an account or who doesn't customize their subscriptions.
