I feel very alone. I just wish I had a definitive diagnosis one way or the other. Since this has happened I feel overly emotionally dependent upon my boyfriend. I cry a lot and I just feel bad about myself. Everything seems different now. I have trouble being alone and am constantly trying to preoccupy my mind.
