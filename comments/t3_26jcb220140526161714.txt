Yes -- they're called "crisis centers," Here in Wisconsin we have over 100 crisis centers, fifty of them being in Milwaukee where only two clinics who perform abortions are. There are only two other locations in the entire state who perform them. This is very VERY typical in every state. And what's worse, is they usually position themselves very close to the clinics that do the procedures. They receive funding from state, churches, and donations.

Right now all over Milwaukee they're advertising free ultrasounds at these crisis clinics on billboards and public transportation, and they're located in only low-income neighborhoods (we're the most segregated city in America). They coerce women and tell them they'll be taken care of, like offering newborn diapers and formula, but are notorious for doing absolutely nothing after the women chooses to give birth. In some states, it's required by law to have counseling done at a crisis center and wait 24 hrs before receiving the actual procedure.
