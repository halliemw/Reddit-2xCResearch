Neither do I. (And in fact, what is between your legs does not necessarily define people as men or women.) But I care about how people have experienced the world -- and that is influenced by how the world perceives your gender. It affects the clothes you wear (and see others wearing), your job prospects, whether you walk down dark streets at night, how your teachers treat you, the friends you have, the expectations that your family, friends, coworkers, and acquaintances have about you, your success at weight loss, people's opinion of your appearance and its importance, your expectations about family life, your involvement in different sports, the books you read, your success at salary negotiation, the importance of maternity leave, the timeline for having children, your ability to travel solo, the effect of alcohol on your body, and more.

In sum: growing up as a woman is different from growing up as a man. 

And that means that the perspectives of women are different from those of men. Not better, but different. Different, and more relevant to women looking for advice or to talk about things, *if* they are posting in a place that specializes in "women's perspectives."

Maybe you don't care about this. But the vast majority of people on 2X DO -- based on a recent poll. And those are the people that this subreddit is supposed to serve.
