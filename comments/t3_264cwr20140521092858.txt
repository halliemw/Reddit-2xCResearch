Yeah...That's not nice. I'm totally cool if my fianc√©e talks about getting with Mr. Gosling and if I talk about totally wanting to do Kate Beckinsale that's not a big deal. But if she was talking about sleeping with my friends or coworkers I would have a problem with that and I hope she would have something to say if I did the same.
