I think that it's actually cute and adds a lot of character to your face. And I'm not just saying that. You're a cute girl. It's not distracting at all. Like someone else said, if I saw you and needed to describe you, I wouldn't say "the girl with a mole on her chin" as a first second or third option." 

Again, cute and character. and I would be honest. My sister had a mole removed on her neck (pre-cancerous reasons not cosmetic.) and it did leave a fairly thick pink scar that took years to fade. It's really up to you, but my opinion is that I'd have character for a mole on my chin, then a scar on my chin. 

Also, I went through similar discomfort because I wanted breast surgery because I hate my breasts. I felt like they were unnatural looking and gross- but after surveying a ton of people I found a lot of guys I was with liked them, didn't notice, and I came to like them as a trait that makes me different and unique- and that scars would probably be a bit worse then just something that bothered me but no one else...
