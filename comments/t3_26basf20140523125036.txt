my fiance and i are finally moving (1500 miles away) out of our college town in 2 months.  in 4 months i get to marry him in a pretty princess dress and we're going to athens, santorini, and mykonos for our honeymoon.

the weather is warm, i have weed, it's friday of a three day weekend, and my office is closing up early this afternoon.  [also, my hair looks fantastic today.](http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/03/Yay-GIF.gif)
