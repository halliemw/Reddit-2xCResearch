Oh. So is my ignorance, I thought it would be illegal to be atheist in a Muslim country?

Fun story. Do you know what BYU is? If not, it is in Utah, and THE Mormon college. I went there for a conference a couple years ago. We actually found a liquor store, but they were having a clearance sale due to seeing new regulation being pushed through severely limiting the sake if alcohol. I felt bad for them but we had a great party after the conference.
