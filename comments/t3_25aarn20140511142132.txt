I agree with dexterpoopybaby. The wording is quite confrontational. It may help to take some time to think about what you're trying to accomplish. If you're purpose for writing the letter is to lash out in anger and start a fight, then your draft above will do just that. If you want to show her that you're a mature, confident woman who can make her own decisions, I would recommend that you focus on phrasing that conveys this.
Also, telling someone that they have to stop how they speak to you is usually worthless. Actions have more impact. For example, leave the room if she starts on that topic. If you're on the phone with her, tell her "I'm sorry but it's time for this conversation to end. Love you" and hang up.
