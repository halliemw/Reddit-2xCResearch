> They kind of shoved it in my head that the ER is for people with broken bones, trauma and people near death.

Screw that, better safe than sorry. I go to the doctor for small things all the time, there's no reason at all to feel weird about it! You'll feel so much better if you go, it will save you a lot of worrying. Seriously, never feel silly for getting your health checked, that's what doctors are for.

I'm sure you'll be fine, but please play it safe. Tell us how things went too!
