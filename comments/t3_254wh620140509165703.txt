Thanks! 

You're right, the best way to get back as close to normal as quickly as possible is to continue behaving like the awesome contributors you've always been.  Upvote good content, downvote bad content, report trolling and jerky comments and PMs. 

The past 3 days have been very rough, but reaction to IFF posts today has been encouraging. Our vote patterns are slowly going back to normal, we're seeing more of our usual content on the front page, and the trolling and jerkyness in our mod queue has gone way down.  We're still a far ways off from normal, but things are looking up.

Thanks so much for being awesome.
