The two are incompatible. The Koran says the testimony of a woman is worth less than that of a man, and daughters get less inheritance than sons. Islam is both a religion and a basis of law. Women are never equals.   
If you are a woman who follows the Koran and believe Mohammed is a prophet, then you must accept this. We can say the burqha is not required, which is true. But in sharia, two women must testify for it to be worth the testimony of a man. The Koran perhaps is only somewhat less discriminatory than most Islam as it is practiced in the middle East. But the Koran is fundamentally more incompatible with western feminism than the bible.
