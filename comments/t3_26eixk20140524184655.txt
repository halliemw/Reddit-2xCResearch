What you can do depends on how blatantly misogynistic it is. The more obvious the intolerance, the larger a battle you're facing. 

Can you give an example of typical redpill stuff? Because most of what I see on that sub is just creepy strategies for picking up women (think "if you drive her back to your place then go inside, she's forced to follow you in, hahaha"). Nothing blatantly intolerant. but I don't spend a lot of time there for obvious reasons. 

It sounds like somebody said something in particular that's bothering you, but you don't want to say it. Spit it out, what is it?
