It sounds like he's completely devoid of empathy which is a huge red flag to me? Like I'd kind of expect at least some vague attempt to relate or sympathize. I've had people in my life who deal with things with humor, and I can understand that even if some people might think they're being insensitive, but I don't see how "was the food good?" or "have fun at your sleepover!" could ever be justifiable responses to death from anyone capable of empathizing with anyone... 

Granted I don't know the tone he's saying these things in, he might just  really suck at jokes or something. But coupled with "Hey, your death in the family gave me time to pick up a new kayak!" I'm pretty sure I would have walked out on this guy...
