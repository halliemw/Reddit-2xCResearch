They don't have the original anymore, no. Thank goodness my mother has saved it and all the tiny pieces (even the christmas decorations I made for the house, which I still set up long after I stopped playing with it because my mom was so reluctant to put it in storage). There's going to be a fight between my sister and I on who get's to give it to our children though, I can feel it. I think it will end with who has a girl first haha.
