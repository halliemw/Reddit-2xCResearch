I never thought of him as a manipulative type, he's so gentle and sweet usually. You are right though, he needs to stop making those comments and the time limit seems like an excellent idea. We have a serious conversation ahead of us.

I'm so glad that things worked out for you and your husband. How did you start introducing your friends to him? How long have you been together? I know how hard it is on guys to accept other men in their girlfriends/wives lives, kudos to you for finding a good one!
