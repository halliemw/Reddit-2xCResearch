"Repulsed" is a far cry from  "not his type." And he's been surrounded by those people for years, yet he's interested in you. He knows you aren't small, but he also knows you're smart and he finds your personality and your face attractive, and that's like half the battle.

I think the most unattractive part of how you described yourself was the complete lack of confidence. The second most unattractive part was the depression and associated apathy. These are things you can actually change and when you work on them, I think you'll find that your physical attractiveness will follow.
