Two years is very doable! LDRs are like any other relationship, communicate and stay honest with one another. I started an LDR two years ago after dating the guy for three months. I'm moving in with him in a month and a half! 

We didn't talk on the phone every day, but we texted often. We sent each other cards. We were open about when we needed a weekend to work, and when we needed to see the other person. 

Do what works for you. Don't focus on the end point, focus on how to make each other happy now.
