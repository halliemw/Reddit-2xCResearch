Maybe Sailor Moon? For adolescent girls at least. As adults, we can realize the romance between her and Mamoru is a little over the top, and your whole life shouldn't revolve around a man, but man was she my hero at 13. 

Kicked butt, looked cute, had a ton of cool friends AND she dated the hottest dude around. Also it focuses on girl power and female friendship more than anything else. The new dub will have Uranus and Nepture as actual lesbian, too, so that's good for all the young queer girls. I don't think she has an idealized body type though, and I don't think the term "power fantasy" necessarily applies here. Power isn't the most sought after attribute. 

For the other stuff, it's pretty obvious I think.
