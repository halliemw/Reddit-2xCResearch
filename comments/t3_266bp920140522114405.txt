 "hey can I have your number?", "do you want to get a drink after this?"
Not Harassment IMHO


 "nice outfit today. You should wear that more often" Crossing the line into harassment IMHO, because I always felt weird when they told me to do something (for them?)...but my response would be to say thanks for the compliment and just keep moving, but maybe let them know how they were coming off if they persisted in giving me the idea that they were telling me to do something for them.

I once had a weird guy in an office go around tickling the women who worked there. I saw he was making one uncomfortable, and others were telling him to knock it off. He walked in my direction and I told him I'd knock his teeth out if he touched me and also asked him if he ever tickled his male co-workers. He stopped tickling.
