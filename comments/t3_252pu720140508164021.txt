I totally agree, I'm not female and I've never been subscribed to this subreddit but I decided to the check the /new to see what everyone was talking about with the "OMG ITS DEFAULT ITS RUINEDDDD OMGGGGGGG" and I really haven't seen anything other than stupid kids asking obvious questions that can be googled in two seconds. I don't understand why people like to just give up so easily.
