The thing I don't get is: I know plenty of super crunchy, super happy to nurse wherever moms and I have *never* found them to ever be showing more of their breasts than what you'd see walking out in public, except if they need to adjust and help the baby relatch and then there's a blip of nipple. And unless you are actively staring, you do not have to see the blip of nipple.

Some babies refuse to be nursed under a blanket. *I* personally wouldn't be pleased if I had to eat all of my meals under a covering and unlike a baby, I have a way of expressing myself other than screeching. 

It sucks that it makes people uncomfortable. It totally is. But that's not the mom's fault or her responsibility. And sure, ideally women would be discreet with their nursing- but I have yet to see all these mothers who are flaunting their breasts and actively making an effort to not be discreet like I keep reading comments about. 

Edit: Sometimes I don't write sentences that make sense.
