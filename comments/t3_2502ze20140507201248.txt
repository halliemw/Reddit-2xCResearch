Most posts by trans* members are very well received here. It's not uncommon to see them on the main page with hundreds of positive comments. Prior to default status this sub is/was very welcoming of trans* members and discussion regarding trans* issues. TERF types haven't been an issue here as far as my experience goes. I hope it remains that way.
