I understand your point, but to play devils advocate:

Road trip was about a ROAD TRIP with the motivator being a woman. Road trip things happen on road trips. Woman happens in the end.

40 year old virgin is about a MAN THATS A VIRGIN being awkward in everything, exploring the downfalls of lack of confidence and learning how to grow up and truly connect with someone.

The Other Woman is about OTHER WOMEN IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN. They're not traveling somewhere, they're not claiming to have some other motivator for the characters. That's it. The relationship with the man. Yes, It's bland and it's trite. But in no way is that surprising that it's 100% of the movie.
