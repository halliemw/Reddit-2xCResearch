Guy here.  The pressure to be thin must be awful, and I know the pressure won't disappear from society.  I have a strong attraction to an idealized physical appearance, and attribute it to a jillion years of evolutionary conditioning, plus a dab of societal conditioning.  I have no idea how heavy 11 stone is, but you are just fine like that if you can find peace.  All of us must find a level of peace with our humanity.

My equivalent is that society says I should be more social (no, I'm not a psychopath, I'm married and manage 30+ employees), and I just have to find peace, but can never fit the mold others think I should conform to.

I am fit for my age, but have to think about food every day to stay that way.  If you want to do a little, without destroying your loves of food and cooking, try cutting back a little on stuff with processed sugars, pastas, white bread, French fries.  Find a happy medium, which may be a moving target over time.  Hope this post doesn't offend...
