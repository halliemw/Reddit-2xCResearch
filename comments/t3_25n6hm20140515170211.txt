Honestly don't be bothered unless they touch you physically. I think it's annoying and immature and 100% way for them to get shut down immediately. 

Funny thing is, I think they know it never works. They just do it because they're idiots and have nothing better to do. I just usually laugh it off with a "Nice try" kinda attitude. No one has been too vulgar tho that's why I guess. 
To be honest, I'd just be like whatever and keep looking at your phone because that is 100X more interesting than nasty men who probably haven't gotten laid in years. Keep your chin up, keep walking proudly, and be like whatever this is nothing. You got a life to live. Don't give them your attention or time. You could be texting some crush back or eating ice cream or heck listening to a biology lecture. Honestly, fuck them they don't deserve your attention.
