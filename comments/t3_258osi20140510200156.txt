Similar boat. My mom died when I was 10 (long battle with cancer, but I was too young to realize she was dying). I love my dad and my stepmom, and know that I wouldn't be the woman I am today without them, but I have so many unanswered questions. I have 3 older siblings who help a bit, and some of my mom's friends, but I want to know *so many things* that my Dad doesn't remember. After raising 4 kids to adults, I can't blame him for forgetting the little things, and I think that my mom probably wouldn't remember all of it either, but I hate that I don't get to ask.   
My husband and I were going through a box of his childhood stuff and found his "baby book" the other day, and his mom had written a lot of details about her pregnancy and his first year of life. I want to know that about my life. I want to know so much about my mother, and I can never ask.   
I know that it'll hurt more when I get married and a LOT more when I get pregnant, but I know that I will have my sisters, mother-in-law, and stepmom to rely on for stories and memories of their own.   
It's not the best way to look at it, but I tell myself that I was lucky to have her for 10 years, and lucky to have come out the other side as a healthy, happy woman. Not everyone in this world knows who their mother was, or knows how much she loved them. I do. And if that's all I get, that's good enough for me. I don't have her curly hair or her accent, but I have my memories, a lot of photographs, and the knowledge that I'm living a life that would make her happy and proud.
