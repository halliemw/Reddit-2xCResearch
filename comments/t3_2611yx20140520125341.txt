Ooph. That exactly describes my last boss and place of work. When we were faced by cutbacks and everyone on the team was at risk, she actively worked against those of us seeking to work elsewhere in the department--failing to provide necessary paperwork, badmouthing people, offering to be a reference and then failing to do so. Then, she worked behind the scenes to force several people into admin assistant positions (not that there's anything wrong with being an admin, but we were not trained at all for the job), then leveraged how hard she'd been working to "save" our jobs to get a promotion for herself and saddling us with a new manager who yelled, swore at us, made rude remarks and called us names. Also a woman. I can't tell you how glad I was to get outta there. At least now I have a name for these women's behaviour.
