You're welcome!  Thing is to remember that everyone (mostly) has been there at least once.  It's shitty, but you'll move on when you are ready to.  *Jedi hugs* 

Being friends directly after is a bad idea.  Of course he wants to be friends!  It makes his guilt for hurting you magically reduce.  See how fine you are with everything?  All while you are miserable and wasting energy pretending to be OK.  It will just make you more sad with a bit of hope (maybe he will change his mind).  While also slowing the healing process.    

It's completely fine to tell him not to contact you until you let him know that you are ready.  Keep it short and to the point without a feelingsdump.  "Hey ex BF, while I understand your wanting to be friends I need some time apart to process the situation.  I will let you know when I'm ready to be friends."  Then stop responding.   

You never have to be friends with him or you could decide one day to reach out as a friend.  It's your choice to make and one that you don't have to decide right now.
