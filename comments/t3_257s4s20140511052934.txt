As a general comment, thank you so much for all of your responses. It means a lot to me that so many of you replied and that some of you also brought up experiences that I realise will be difficult or painful to think about. I'm going to exercise my right to feel abused by my ex-boyfriend. He didn't respect me as he should have, regardless of my other sexual interests. Thank you for your support, it's been invaluable in helping me to continue my process of healing. Much love, TwoXers. <3
