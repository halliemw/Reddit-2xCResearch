Well you better go round up all of the guys you know and tell them to spread the word that sexual assault is disgusting and should not be tolerated, because as it is most women will experience a sexual assault in their lifetime, and we wouldn't want guys to run out of girls to date now would we?

I recommend people like you make sure someone hasn't been sexually assaulted before you start dating. However, there are plenty of people who understand statistics and who can actually help their partner cope and move on.
