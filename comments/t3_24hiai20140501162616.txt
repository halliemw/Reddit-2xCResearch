First - **get in counseling**.  If you're not already seeing a counselor you trust & feel comfortable with, FIND ONE.  I am not joking.  I attempted suicide many times when I was your age, and you *need* to get professional help.  

There is *no shame* in needing help.  NONE.  And I would rather sit here and yell at you to go to a counselor and you hate me than find out you'd hurt yourself or worse, taken your own life.  I've lost a very close friend to suicide.  It still tears me apart inside and I will never, ever stop missing him.  So even if someone decides to hate me for speaking up, I'd rather they hate me and be alive than I stay silent and they die.   

And if you're taking psych meds that are not helping, SPEAK UP.  At your age psych meds can cause bad side effects and you *NEED* to make sure your docs are aware of this.  Again, there is no shame here!  You're doing this to get better! =) 

Second - I want to make this super clear.  Virtually none of us start out confident and calm and collected.  We're scared, confused, fucked up, sad, you name it.  We *all* feel like ugly pieces of shit sometimes.  We *all* have days where we feel like we're fucking it all up, we can't do a damn thing right, etc.  We all have to fake it sometimes and put on the plastic smile and pretend we know what the hell we're doing.  Most of the time, I don't.  I fake it anyway.  So far, it works.  People seem to see me as confident & smart & professional, while inside I feel like a dipshit half the time.  

Third - I don't think many women would be able to just snap their fingers and "get over" someone they've been in love with.  I sure as hell didn't.  I've been there, man.  I've been fucked over, cheated on, treated like shit, and hated myself.  I have.  I have been doubled over in uncontrollable sobbing for days on end, wondering why I am such a shitty person to have made someone do this to me.  (Pro tip - it's *not* you, *he* cheated on you.  HE is the problem.) 

I won't sugar coat it.  It fucking sucks.  It hurts, it's humiliating, and you kind of just want to disappear it's so awful.  But focus on *you*, and getting *you* better, and one day you'll realize you don't need your ex or his hurtful behavior, and that really being in love with someone means they don't do this shit to you.  They treat you with respect and they don't deliberately hurt you like that.  And you'll realize you're awesome.  And stronger than you ever thought you were.  (Hint - you *are*.  You just don't know it yet.) 

So hey.  You're not alone here.  We all start out as people who aren't power and confident.  We all start out naked & scared & confused, and it takes a lot of time to become even remotely confident.  And even then, half the time it's just a front.  I'm nearly 32 and finally figured this out within the past 2-3 years.  It takes *time*.  It's hard.  

But it's worth it.  Suddenly I feel like a real person, a whole human being.  I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks, I love me for me because I *rock*.  I'll always try to keep improving, but I know now that even though life sometimes really sucks ass, it's worth it.  

And I know you'll get there someday, too, as long as you keep biting and kicking and scratching your way to being a happier, better, stronger, smarter, even more awesome than you already are kind of person.  The fact that you actively seek out help when you know you're struggling tells me you'll get there.  

You're going to get through this.  You're stronger than you think you are.  You can do this.  <3
