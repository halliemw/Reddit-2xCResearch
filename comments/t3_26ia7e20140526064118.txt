With my DD breasts I just don't feel comfortable without a bra, they are saggy enough to get sweaty under them and just kinda floppy when not properly contained. 

I find that women who say they find bras uncomfortable, have most probably not found their fit yet. There is a surprising number of women who wear one that is completely wrong for them. 

If someone has perky breasts that look superb without a bra- congratulations. I celebrate your ability to go braless. 

But I also think that there are a lot of women (mainly older and with curvyer body types) who would benefit from a good bra. Boobs hanging down to ones knees will look anyone old.
