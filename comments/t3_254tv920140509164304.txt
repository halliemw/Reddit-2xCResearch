Heh, one part of having a baby is keeping track of seemingly meaningless milestones.

Remember when you went from child sized shoes to adult shoes (and had all that much more choice in what to wear)? Or when you drove for the first time without anyone else in the car?

It's a serious of things like that. So, recently my tiny human has been:
* holding his head up, better
* smiling when he's not pooping
* doing a good job of tracking people

Yes, squishy cheeks, yes adorable, and I am pretty sure I could stop all war if I could bottle the feeling of leaning back in a chair to watch Game of Thrones with him sleeping on my chest.
