I wrote a piece for a creative writing class where I referenced my love for my unshaved underarms and someone provided me with the word "kitten pits". It perfectly described why I am so fond of my body hair - it feels like a really low-maintenance of like a pet now instead of the troublesome chore it used to be!

I still shave my legs because love the smooth feeling, but I always got razor burn when I shaved my armpits, especially in the summer, and one day I just realized I wasn't shaving because I liked ANYTHING about it. I suddenly had no idea why I was doing it, so I just stopped. My mom still doesn't like it, but I'm a big fan!

I love reading everyone's stories about their own body hair. This is such a supportive community! Thanks ladies!
