The big problem is that the whole history/context behind this "expectation vs reality" meme is to make fun of the second 'reality' image.  Go google 'expectation vs reality meme' you find its all poking fun of the second image.  Girl using knees to give herself breasts, the meal on the box cover looking nothing like the actual meal, hot girl climbing out of pool mimicked sadly by another girl.  In light of the context/historical use of this meme- it is a cop out saying they were not aiming to poke fun of the second image for whatever various reason.


That being said, under the context of making fun of nerdy girls, I think people do need thicker skins.  You get made fun of in life, we ALL do.
