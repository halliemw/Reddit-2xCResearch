Apologizing in advance for the tangent - but mental illness didn't teach that guy what he believed. He was part of online groups, a whole support system, and had his beliefs "verified" in real life because misogyny is real, pervasive, and actively destructive. Anyone who dismisses that aspect of the case is damaging society as a whole.
