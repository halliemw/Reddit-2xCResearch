Yes. The mods care more about new users than their current and faithful users. It sucks. It's a hurdle we will get over or we'll flounder. Only time will tell.

There are women talking about period cramps with 46 down votes, another woman who had a creepshot taken of her called a ho and other names and down voted. The mods don't seem to get that DELETING the comments doesn't stop them from being harmful. They don't seem to get that excessive down voting discourages activity. It's fucked up.
