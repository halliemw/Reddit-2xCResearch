It's possible that it's genetic, but it's also very possible that you'll be fine.

Breastfeeding does not come easy for everyone. We no longer live in communal houses where we all nurse each other's babies and teach each other how it's done. However, with good support from a doctor, a trained lactation consultant, community support, and numerous web resources (Kellymom.com and /r/breastfeeding are great), you may do just fine. There are things you can do to get your body to lactate or lactate more. And if they don't work, or you don't want to go down that path, formula is fine too.
