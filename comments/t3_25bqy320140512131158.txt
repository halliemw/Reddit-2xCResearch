As a fat man, pretty much exactly what this article described. I have had both men and women yell at me from their cars, most memorably a gaggle of teenage girls yelled in unison,  "you're ugly." God forbid I ride my bike or skateboard, then I get things thrown at me, honking horns, etc. The experience described in this article has a lot less top do with being a woman and a lot more to do with being fat.
