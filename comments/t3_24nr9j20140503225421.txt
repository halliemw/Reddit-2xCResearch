I'm so sorry. I've been in the same situation. He ended up marrying her, and from what I can tell, is decently happy (which I'm happy for them, really). But the worst part was that we were SUCH good friends and had so much fun all the time before we started sleeping together, and he just dropped me like jack-shit out of the blue, and I almost never heard from him again. But! It got better! I found someone I love more than anything, who is perfectly on my wavelength, loves all of me ( even all those things I hate about myself) and *(drumroll please)* no ex-gf baggage! Someone I never thought I'd find, and the big idiot just fell into my lap.

So that person is out there. You *will* heal, and you'll come back swinging, I guarantee it. And you'll look back at him with fond memories, but you'll be glad that the ending of that relationship let you move on with your life. Trust me, you're going to be great.
