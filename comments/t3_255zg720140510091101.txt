My dad passed away from cancer right before I tired 13 (17 days, to be exact). It was 16 years this April. I am sitting here reading this with tears rolling. You sound like a wonderful father. 

The hardests days for me have been the milestones in my life. Turning 16, graduating from high school, and both of my college graduations. I agree that letters for special occasions would be a wonderful thing for both of your children. 

At this point, I am in a relationship with a wonderful man who I know Dad would have loved. We have picked out a ring, and he's asked my moms permission. I know there will be days that I will miss him more than ever.
