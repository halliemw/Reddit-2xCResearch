I'm leaving a job like this after a miserable few months. It started out kind of similar and only went downhill, to the point that I was vomiting from being so stressed at work.
It's easy for people to say who cares? And they're just coworkers and don't matter, but when you're working 40+ hours a week with these people it can be super draining.
I tried to ignore it/kill them with kindness (bring in bagels for everyone instead of just one for myself every once a while, baked muffins and brought them in, ect) I tried to ignore the snide comments and applied like crazy until I finally found a different position. 
If you like the job and can brush it off and avoid or ignore it, good. It helps to have friends in the office, so maybe you can befriend a different girl or one of the guys who has been helping you. Besides that I wish you good luck! It's such a shame to have a good job but be miserable because of coworkers.
