I'm afraid I don't really agree that the goals of feminists have been met, at least in the US and in many countries outside of Europe.

There's still a gender gap in pay equality, although it's generally argued that that's because men do more difficult/higher risk jobs, and yet the job that women (mostly, and some men) do, of raising the next generation of adults, is still devalued and not supported, which can be seen in the salaries paid to daycare workers and teachers.

Abortion is becoming *more* difficult, not less, to obtain in an alarming portion of the US; political support for social nets and affordable medical care for families has declined; throughout many parts of the developing world women are still held back and often not even allowed an education, much less the opportunity to earn a living.

Anyone who thinks feminism has done it's job vis-a-vis gender equality and is no longer relevant is only looking in their own neighborhood, and not at the wider world we all live in.

Edit: I didn't really finish my thought. Part of gender equality is simply respect for other individuals. There are always going to be those who are 'creepers'; but making it less socially acceptable is the only way to get it toned down. 

There's a certain amount of 'group think' in play when men think it's ok to leer at women in public as if those women were objects and not other human beings. The same social force that is working to make childhood bullying unacceptable should also make public disrespect by adults equally unacceptable.

The internet has both exacerbated and yet in some ways brought these issues to light, because how often do we get onto forums such as these and not really know what is the gender, race, economic status, etc., of the other posters behind each keyboarded response?
