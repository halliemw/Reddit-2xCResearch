If you think the Tea Party isn't openly racist, you should pop over to sites like Twitchy and Free Republic. 
On Free Republic, they go so far as to post pics depicting people of color as apes/baboons, etc.
They're totally racist.... like... your embarrassing Great Grandfather with Alzheimer's racist.
