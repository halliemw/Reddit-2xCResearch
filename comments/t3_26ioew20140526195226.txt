It's funny, I have the opposite experience. I didn't date at all in high school and when I started to in college I had no idea what was going on, panicked all the time, and hurt a few boys with my erratic behavior. I wish I'd had some earlier experience to make things smoother and not have my first real relationship at age 21. I made a lot of dumb mistakes that I would've rather had made at 16
