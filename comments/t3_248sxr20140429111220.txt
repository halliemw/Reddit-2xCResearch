It's a webseries called Marble Hornets that's been going for 4+ years now - found-footage style entries, anywhere from 1-10 minutes apiece, with a great balance of exposition/tension and actual scares. They definitely take advantage of the outdoor aspects you mentioned in Tuscaloosa - some of the most upsetting entries are shot in forests/parks in the area.
