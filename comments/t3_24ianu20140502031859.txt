Although I understand the spirit of your post, my guess is that the OP isn't just talking about some man politely pulling her aside at a coffee shop and telling her that she looks very pretty and that he'd fancy having lunch with her sometime.

What *is* uncomfortable (and what I imagine the OP is alluding to) are leers, head to toe examinations, kissy noises, whistles, and those calling out opinions about your body parts and/or what they'd like to do with them.  I think the phenomenon of a less interpersonal world that you mention exists, but I don't imagine that someone just stopping for a moment to kindly say hello is what the OP is struggling with.  

She also mentions that most of the men are considerably older than she is (like her father's age)  Real talk, I personally think it is a little presumptuous for a 50 year old man to hit on a 20 year old girl.  Even if the advances weren't exactly sexually suggestive (and I am guessing from the OP's post that they were), I could see a young girl feeling uncomfortable in such a situation.  Maybe that's an elitist and snobby thing to say, but I highly doubt that if the genders were flipped that anyone would think a 50 year old women in her right mind for putting the moves on a 20 year old college boy.

Maybe I am wrong, and the OP can feel free to clear this up; perhaps giving some examples of these encounters could better paint the picture, but I think you're assuming that the interactions are neutral and non-threatening, one human being just striking up conversation with another.  However, I do not think that this is what's going on here, because I can't imagine the OP referring to people as "perpetrators" unless there is a certain degree of inappropriate behavior going down.
