My SO has OCD as well there are a few behaviors on here I can definitely identify with. One time my SO was over an hour late to meet me because he hadn't showered yet and really insisted on doing so. He also believes that his OCD is an unchangeable part of him.

I make a lot of concessions for his OCD, but your SO's behavior would be unacceptable to me. My SO is mildly homophobic (he's totally ok with gay couples but is largely repelled towards gay PDA) and it has nothing to do with OCD and more to do with his own personal values and preferences. There are a lot of things on this list that don't read compulsive or anxiety-related to me, and I'd be willing to bet that if I asked my SO or a therapist they would say the same thing.

You need to differentiate between what is OCD and what is not. But at the end of the day, the OCD really doesn't matter. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who takes issue with body hair, does't allow you to sleep in his bed, and is intensely homophobic?
