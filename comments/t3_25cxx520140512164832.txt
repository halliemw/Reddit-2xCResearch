To be honest, whenever this had happened to me it's always been very comforting. I have a shitty family and have been through some equally shitty situations. One day I was walking home from work, about to cry, when someone told me I should smile and feel better. It was a guy, but to me that didn't really matter. To me, it's really just a "Things will get better" or a "feel better soon" and when everyone around you who is supposed to love you doesn't, it coming from a stranger can actually be quite comforting.
