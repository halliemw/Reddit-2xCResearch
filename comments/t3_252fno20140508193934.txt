No. I like TwoX because unlike the rest of Reddit, being female is just... neutral. We can talk about girl stuff -- or not -- without qualifying or explaining our gender.

Plus I don't think dudes really need to announce themselves here. If being male is specifically relevant to the discussion, they can bring it up. If they feel the need to mention they're male in every comment, they should consider using the rest of the internet instead.
