>Yes she is allowed to be beautiful but she should be aware of the consequences.

That is a horrific and lazy attitude. You're being permissive of the sexist behaviours instead of rejecting them, not to mention implying that men simply can't help but disrespect women if they aren't covered head to toe in baggy clothing. Thin people, fat people, purple people - whatever people they are - should not factor in to how people treat them, even if it's "kinder" behaviour.
