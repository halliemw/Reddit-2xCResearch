I do the hair-fiddling thing too! I try to control it - excessive hair-playing-with can be read as an indicator of attraction, I don't want to give off incorrect signals because my hands got bored. 

I also 100% do the bare feet thing, whenever I'm able! My favorite is cool grass, or sand that's so soft it makes that *prrr* noise whenever you take a step.
