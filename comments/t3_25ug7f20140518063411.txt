What if he cheats on you again? Will you leave him then? How many times is too many times? 

I don't believe "once a cheater always a cheater," but I do know how much easier it gets after you've done it once. I don't want you to wake up 15 years from now and feel that you wasted so much of your life, and now you're starting over again, so much older.
