The nurse *should have* said something like, "oh sure enough, let's get you cleaned up."  And then cleaned you up and put something under you to soak up the blood until the doctor could get there and remove your catheter.  There's no excuse for the way she treated you.  I'm so sorry you had to deal with that!  It's her that should be embarrassed, and the tech who didn't even close the door.
