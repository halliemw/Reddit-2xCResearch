Most of the time the problem isn't over a phone number though. Men who shout out of cars at a woman aren't hoping to get a phone number, the same for men who pinch your ass as they walk past you. I don't know what they're motivation is but it inherently shows a lack of respect. It doesn't really matter what the reason is for why they don't do it when a man is with a woman, they are still showing more respect for that man and his 'property' than they do a woman on her own.
