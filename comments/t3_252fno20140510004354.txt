If a convicted murderer is giving us testimony about facts in the world, for example whether they subsequently killed an inmate, that's one thing. But my example was of  "the claim that an argument about the rightness or wrongness of killing is invalid". A convicted murderer arguing that, defending oneself against a knife attack or killing another because they looked askance, justifies the subsequent killing of the inmate is giving us an argument about the rightness or wrongness of the killing. The convicted murderer's arguments are not invalid (or valid) in virtue of being a convicted murderer.

> 1. Hitler argued for the superiority of the Aryan race and the inferiority of the jews
2. But Hitler was a murderous, megalomaniacal, anti-semite.

> [3.] Therefore, we should reject Hitler's arguments.
