I second this. Pepper spray is one of the best self defense items one can carry. It doesn't mater how big you are, it doesn't matter how much military training you have, if you are hit with a potent pepper spray you are going down. I'm not a small man, but even I carry one because it's so convenient. If you are worried about the "cloud" of spray that might hit you also, you can always get a "stream" pepper spray which works kind of like a water pistol. 

However, make sure that you buy a quality brand [from what I've read, FOX Labs is one of the best] and check your local state laws on how potent it can be. Also, when you buy a new spray, test it to make sure that it works.
