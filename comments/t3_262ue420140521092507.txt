I got my first Mirena in January. Around late March, I couldn't feel the strings. I went into my doctor, and she said they'd just relaxed and coiled so well that I wouldn't be able to feel them. Apparently it's normal for lots of ladies to have the strings out, but not really be able to check them. However, most of the time if your IUD's going to get displaced, it'll happen within the first few months of having it. So I'm just trusting it. I'm mostly happy I'm not getting poked by a wandering string anymore (and so is my husband!).
