I would hazard to say that you don't know a whole lot about the MRM. First and foremost, you don't know that Rogers wasn't part of it, and in fact started out as a PUA (pick up artist, a group the MRM doesn't like very much) and then when that failed him joined an anti-PUA group that was also very much not part of the MRM.
