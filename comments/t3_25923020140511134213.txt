Yup. I see a lot of "fuck shaving" types of sentiments on tumblr accompanied by photos of skinny girls who just have the wispiest hint of pit fur and naturally perfectly-triangular-shaped pubic hair. I don't shave anything, and I sure as shit don't look like that. I'm fat, I have bad skin, and my bikini line goes halfway down my goddamn thighs. She-wolf solidarity!
