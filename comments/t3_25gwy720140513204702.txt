When I got my degree, It was only me, my husband and stepson. My mom lives nearby, but she's a little too dysfunctional for me to take in any dose. 
I got my hair done (cut and color), bought a new dress and a pair of nice shoes went to the ceremony and later my husband took me out to dinner at my fave restaurant. It was a lovely day. It was nice to go beyond jeans and sneakers for an evening. It was a special event. I was the first woman in the family to earn a degree. I celebrated myself.
