That happened to me once and I really never want that to happen again. It was actually on my one year anniversary with my boyfriend and we had reservations at a nice restaurant and a whole night planned. It was terrible. No worries, I didn't think you were trying to one up me! Haha. Before I started birth control I was just a mess. I wasn't using tampons yet and I leaked every time even if I wore those big overnight pads. And than there's people like my aunt who's flow is so light she doesn't even need to wear anything. I'm so jealous of her!
