Oh I see, nevermind then. No problem, just thought I'd try to be helpful since I meet a lot of people who don't realize how relatively simple it can be to read sidebars from reddit apps. Or those who just didn't think to use their browser for such things, haha. Not dogging them at all! When you use a reddit app for your mobile browsing you forget you can just use your phone's browser, lol.
