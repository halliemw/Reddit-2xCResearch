Gonna agree with this...I got two today, one from a deleted user, the other from a not-even-ten-minutes-old account. I think it's because I mentioned the one I got last night.

Oh well -- report, block, repeat. I'm lucky that it doesn't affect me much (unless something else already has my emotional walls compromised).
