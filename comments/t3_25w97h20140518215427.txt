do you know anything about attachment styles? you should maybe watch these videos: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2F81DA019233C8DC it sounds like he has a very avoident attachment style and you might have an anxious attachment style, so when he's stressed or worried about the relationship his instinct is to avoid you, but when you are stressed or worried about the relationship your instinct is to cling to him. So you get an unhealthy chasing dynamic. 

I was in a relationship a few years ago with a guy who was depressed and I felt like what this psychologist was saying about attachment styles really helped explain what I was going through. That relationship really ripped my heart out at the end - I don't think I've ever felt so strongly for any guy, before or since. But he wasn't ready to really trust me and rely on me, even though I felt like all I wanted to do was take care of him. I ended up deciding that relationships where you feel like you are being called on to take care of another person are not very healthy. But I still think about him a lot...
