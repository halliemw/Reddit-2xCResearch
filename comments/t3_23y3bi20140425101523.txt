I totally understand, but this is my body AFTER I have struggled with body image since I was 11. I have been "chubby" all throughout my childhood. I used to be called a fatass when I was younger. I have looked in the mirror at myself and actually felt disgusted. I had a baby and that just topped it off. I have never been that depressed with the way I looked. The way my body looks now was not in anyway easy. I work out every morning at 5 am 5 days a week. I have never felt okay with the way I looked until now. I put on this swimsuit and I actually for the first time in years, felt that I look good. I have said that I have a little bit of a belly, my stomach is not flat AT ALL no matter what I try to do, I have stretch marks, etc I do not have a perfect body. Sorry that you feel this way! I don't think you're being mean.
