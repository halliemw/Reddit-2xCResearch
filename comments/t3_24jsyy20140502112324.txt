>But Young’s defense attorney, Scottie Allen, said the judge acted correctly. He said the case involved “two kids messing around at school” but agreed that Young did rape the girl.

When the fucking defense attorney says, 'Yeah he did it', you know you fucked up when you reach that decision. Seriously, this judge is so fucked in the head.

>the judge asked several times about whether the girl cried. The girl testified that she did not cry during the attack but cried afterward.

How do you decide whether her behavior was acceptable like that? "You didn't react strongly enough, you must've wanted it despite saying no". What the fuck is wrong with her? 

>Howard also initially ordered Young to do 250 hours of community service at a rape crisis center. But the Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center does not want him to complete his hours there.

**I WONDER WHY?**
