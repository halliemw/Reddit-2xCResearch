Oh. You were lucky enough to miss the drama of the first few days as a default. What happened (cobbled together from various mod statements):

The admins went to mods of various subs and gave them about 1-2 days to decide about being defaults, with the explicit instruction not to make the info public. So 2X's mods made the sub a default, then explained the decision in a very piecemeal fashion by responding to individuals threads/comments/mod mails. The mods have the option to un-default at any time with the click of a button.

So a big reason I'm pissed about the change, is that the mods have never really sought community feedback in any organized way, and have dismissed polls about the change (for legit reasons - but still, first day of default status there was a poll 10000 against, 1500 for, 5000 don't care).
