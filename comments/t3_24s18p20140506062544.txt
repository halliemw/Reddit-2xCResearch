The fact that you self harmed at all is indicative of a problem. Even if something specific triggered it, it isn't caused by an isolated incident. It never is. There's always at least a lack of healthy coping mechanisms, and often underlying depression which has different symptoms in kids and teenagers than in adults. No one who is mentally healthy ever deals with anything by self harming.
