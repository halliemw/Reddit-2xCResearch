I'm with you, I got SO angry.  Angry at the guy threatening her, angry at the guys who just looked away.  What the hell?!  My knee jerk reaction was, "You should have obliterated his nuts with a well-placed kick."  But in an enclosed space with no immediate escape, I wouldn't have done that either.  I probably wouldn't have done anything differently... because really, what else can you do?
