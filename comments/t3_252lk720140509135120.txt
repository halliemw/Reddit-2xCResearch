I understand where you might get your reasoning to believe what you wrote. I won't deny that it is, as you put it, 'on the books.' 

Having said that, I feel you're failing to comprehend that culture of the country. Since the Islamic Revolution of '79 Iran has gone through waves and degrees of Islamic law enforcement. Currently, as I was pointing out, things are fairly lax. 

Under Rohani  (current president) people are embracing a more Western lifestyle. Rusaris are worn incredibly loose (the trendiest way is to put a pony tail super high, and then hang the scarf from there and wrap around your shoulders. TONS of hair showing,) women are wearing FULL faced makeup and *men* are embracing tighter pants and more "fashion forward" clothing. All of these things a couple of years ago weren't readily welcomed.  

Now, if the Revolutionary Guard and hardliners were to really fight back against Rohani this all could be enforced again. And then a couple of days later things are back to how they are right now. Political living in Iran goes with the ebb and flows of who's really in charge. 

Getting to my initial disagreement with you, to say that women who let their hair down and take pictures have to fear retribution and lashes are wrong due to the current climate. When one talks about Sharia law and enforcement, you have to understand a country's political culture and customs. Not all Sharia law countries behave the same. To be honest, I don't think things are going to regress any time soon in Iran.
