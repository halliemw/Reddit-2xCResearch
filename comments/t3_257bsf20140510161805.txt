EDIT: I assume this isn't coming across as I intended given the downvotes: this is NOT my opinion. Merely an attempt at explaining WHY people in a grocery store might give dirty looks to a teenager buying them for reasons other than blatant sexism/double standards. I'm in favor of everyone having sex as long as they are ready and responsible enough to do it safely (including purchasing Plan B if other forms of birth control fail or were not available).
 
 
My original post:
I think it's more along the lines of: if you're getting Plan B it means you didn't plan ahead for sex, because you didn't plan ahead, you're irresponsible.  It's still rude and stupid to shame people buying it though, no matter their age.

I think it's different with condoms because that indicates planning on the part of the person buying it.  You are going out of your way to be responsible rather than completely ignoring the possibility that sex might happen and then trying to fix it afterward.  Plus Plan B only covers one potential consequence of sex, it doesn't protect against STI's and the like.

Just my 2 cents.

Whenever I bought it, I was going to a college pharmacy and I'm usually pretty impervious to the shaming.  I would have been mortified as a teenager though.
