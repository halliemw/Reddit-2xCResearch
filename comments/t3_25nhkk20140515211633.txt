I'm not gonna lie, it was rough. I passed by a good margin but it still wasn't easy. I only used an hour and a half of the four hours though, and I studied my ass off. If you're taking the NCMHCE or the NBCC the website counselingexam.com is expensive but worth every penny. Find a few friends and split the cost, I think I would have failed miserably without it.
