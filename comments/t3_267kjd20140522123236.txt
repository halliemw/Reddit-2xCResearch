You know, I was on the pill for a long time, and I commend you for being able to take it well (I was never very good at remembering, even when I did set reminders!) 

Personally, I'm on the Depo Provera, and I love it. Though it is hormonal, I haven't tried a birth control that wasn't hormonal so I don't think I can say I recommend something or another. The Depo is just a shot every three months, and it works wonderful for me. Best of luck in finding whatever works for you.
