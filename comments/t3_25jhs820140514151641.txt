I have always been afraid to wear unlined bras, despite the fact that they are so much more comfortable than padded/lined bras for my breast shape, for the EXACT same reason. I feel you, my friend (except my nipples are visible every day, warm or cold, they're just annoying that way). Perhaps next time I go to the store I will actually get up the courage to buy an unlined bra and go for comfort over my extreme embarrassment. :)
