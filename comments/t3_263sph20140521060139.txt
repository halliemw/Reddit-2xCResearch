Heh, I actually *can* pee again after like 30 minutes, though not that much. My secret is drinking a lot of water AND a lot of tea, makes you have to pee pretty much constantly. I wish I had better advice, but basically just drinking a lot of water - maybe it would help to have a glass now and then throughout the day, not just with meals? Like, just go and have a glass of water sometimes when you want to take a break from working, or have a bottle that you drink from all day. Maybe you already do that though, I don't know.
