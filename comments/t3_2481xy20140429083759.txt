I had a "double vagina" before. Basically, instead of one 
hole down there, I had two smaller ones. Since I couldn't
use tampons and both sex and gynecological exams
were painful I had surgery to fix it.

I had an epidural before the surgery, which was really
uncomfortable but not particularly painful. Obviosuly, I 
felt nothing during the surgery itself.

Healing time was like 2-3 weeks during which time I was
not supposed to use tampons, have sex or swim. I was 
a bit sore around two days after it, but then nothing. No
infections, no change in sensitivity/feel and no other
complications.
