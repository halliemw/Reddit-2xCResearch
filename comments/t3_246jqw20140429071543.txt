Thanks. Yeah that's what I'm doing. It's amazing because 2 months ago I could barely run for the minute it suggests. Now I'm running for around 15 mins before I need to stop. It's good but everyone acts like 5k is no big deal but if you're unfit it's a huge deal. It's disheartening when people just shrug.
