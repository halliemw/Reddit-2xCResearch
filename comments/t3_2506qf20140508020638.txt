That those horror stories in sex ed aren't true. You don't get attached to the first guy you sleep with forever, not all guys have STDs, not every sexual encounter ends in pregnancy, abortion is safe, marriage doesn't cure STD's, and being gay is totally normal. Though, it being the south, you probably can't say that since the school systems there are the ones telling these lies to begin with and you'll probably be fired or run out of town for not lying to these kids.
