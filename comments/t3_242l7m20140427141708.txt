Why would a police report be involved in this situation?  Chill dude, the cops aren't coming.  It was just a douchebag.

Edit: I thought OP was getting paranoid about getting in trouble for the weed.

Anyway, OP: "he started making his way up my thigh... High me kind of noticed it but I kept talking to him" I see a lot of people talking about reporting this incident. WTF? Ladies... At what point do we become advocates for ourselves? Tell him off! Defend yourself! Recommend *almost* groping to campus police? Yes, this guy retardedly misread OP's intentions and made unwanted advances. To me, this doesn't require law enforcement getting involved. This requires simple communication to the jerk and removing yourself from the situation.
