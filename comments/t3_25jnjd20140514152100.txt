The quickest way to ease your mind is to take a pregnancy test. However, as someone with (really) abnormal periods, this isn't uncommon for me. From what I've read online, it seem as though there are a lot of things that can affect your period. If even one of those things is a little off, you may not get a period. 

If the period symptoms are persistent, there are a lot of "home-remedies" for inducing a period. (Personally, I haven't found them particularly helpful, but some women swear by them) 

Goodluck!
