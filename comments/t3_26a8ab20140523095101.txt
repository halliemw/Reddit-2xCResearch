I'm the same way. You're responsible for all your other decisions while drunk. Why should having sex with someone be different? Obviously I think situations where there is a clear difference in intoxication are inappropriate. The important detail here is clear. Just because you blacked and the other person didn't doesn't necessarily count. I have been around quite a few people who were blacked out, and you wouldn't know by interacting with them.
