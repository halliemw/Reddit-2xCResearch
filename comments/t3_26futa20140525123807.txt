I agree that the responsibility lies with him and that people need to learn how to handle rejection. That was a lesson I needed to learn. However, when rejection happens for no apparent reason at a young age, so as to alienate a child from any social interaction, it's difficult to overcome. Some people (especially children) can have trouble understanding how their actions alienate themselves from others.
