You've probably already figured it out by now, but just in case I'm going to post this. Once you have RES installed you can ignore his username. Go to one of his comments hover over his username and a box will pop up. The first option on the bottom is "ignore". Once you've refreshed, this will make it so all his comments are auto-collapsed similar to a downvoted comment. It is a WONDERFUL feature.

Best of luck to you!
