I posted this a few days ago, but I'll say it again:

There was a time in my life when I was really concerned with waxing my upper lip. For a while a toughed it out, but at some point it just became too much for me to handle, or something, and I started waxing it.

Shortly afterwards, I started training Aikido, and I noticed something. A lot of the women there did have notable upper lip hair. And I was JEALOUS of them for it. Jealous that they had faced this thing and stood up to it, or something. And I realized just how stupid it was, to sit there and do something and then be jealous of women who weren't doing it. So I stopped, and yeah I have a light stash and yeah I will keep it.

I've also recently become waaaaay lazier about shaving my legs/armpits. I actually posted a hairy leg picture back in the end of November with the tag #noshamenovember, and I might do it again. Hell, I might even raise money for prostate cancer in the process, since I also like what the original stands for.
