I'm okay with that risk because I don't think I will be disappointed if we happen to get to that point. We do other things which is good, because I don't think I could handle it if I didn't have any physical intimate contact with him. We match up pretty well with libido too and he actually makes me feel better than my ex boyfriend used to, which is awesome. 

But I just love him so much that I want to go all the way with him and show him how you can have such a deeper emotional and physical bond when you bring that intimacy into a relationship.
