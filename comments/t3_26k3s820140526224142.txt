Exactly this. Patrick Stewart himself phrased it excellently, and I'll paraphrase because phone: "People only listen to old white men. I'm an old white man, so I will speak for girls and women." In that sentence he acknowledges three privileges, takes a position and acts positively *using* those privileges. He doesn't want the praise, he wants people to understand. To listen.

THAT is a genuine nice guy.
