Hope you don't mind me asking a couple questions.

My mom encouraged me to see a therapist when I felt kind of depressed, but she never forced me. Did you have to force your daughter to go/drive her yourself? How did she feel after the first session? Did she feel it helped/wanted to go back? Or did you make her stick through a few before she started to see the benefit?

I went, of my own accord, but only once or twice and didn't see any benefit. I felt the therapist was poking at all the wrong things. Not sure if I didn't give it a proper chance, or there was really nothing the therapists could do for me.
