Oh nice, so now slapping your partner once in the whole relationship is abuse, fuck I better get my phone ready to report any woman/man I see at the street getting slapped to the police and prevent all that gender violence.
He was fucking drunk, he was out of himself, he fucked up really badly.
If she still loves him why does she have to throw all her feelings away  when the guy can lay off alcohol and be happy with her? I'm not saying she has to forget or the guy hasn't messed up, if she sees that the violence continues, of course she has to dump him, but to throw it all away because of one fucking night, knowing he would never do something like that sober? Geez, if she still has feelings for him, and the guy doesnt do that ever again I dont think it's worth it
