Be upfront and open about what you are and are not comfortable with. If that changes in the future, you can reevaluate, but don't put undue pressure on yourself or leave the possibility of greater intimacy open when it is not likely to be something you will want. If you don't want your body touched or looked at, you are under NO obligation to have it touched or looked at. There's probably a lot you're dealing with and a lot you have to figure out, but stay within your comfort zone until you are ready to venture out or some qualified person who you trust is there with you for the journey.
