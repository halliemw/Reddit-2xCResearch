My grandmother started her period when she was 9. My mother was always worried that her daughters would start that early, but none of us did.

I actually remember my mom speaking to me  and being worried about me starting at an early age. I don't remember why, I'm guessing I had puberty symptoms? Anyway, I ended up not getting my period until I was 15, my sisters got theirs around 13.

My point is, it is impossible to know exactly when she'll have her period. Every girl is different, she could go through this stage and not get her period for another few years.

I would just make sure you're keeping an open line of communication. Talk about your period with her, and make sure your parents make it a comfortable environment for her. When talking about your period, try and talk about it in a positive light. "I love when my period comes because it means my body is working correctly." Talking about it negatively may scare her. If your mom hasn't already, she should make sure her dad is in on this too. She could get her period when she's there.
