I have to admit I haven't met this book on my travels, but I'll take a peek at it.

Some time ago, when I had been caught in a depression and way too much gaming(I rarely game these days) I started to notice that I was getting similar feelings about real life as I got when playing too much WoW or Skyrim. It's this empty sense of pointlessness. Only way I can describe it is as some kind of "spiritual boredom".

Personally I am a huge fan of the simulation hypothesis and I sometimes wonder if we're just stuck in some kind of massive Online game. In this case I am reminded of [this Alan Watts video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xCFoJ0aywc).

With that in mind I sometimes wonder if we sometimes just get "boring characters" to experience. I remember in my youth, as I played Pen and Paper RPGs, is that if I found the character choices boring I'd be much more suicidal in the way that I took huge risks during the campaign in hopes of dying and getting to roll a new character. Sometimes it feels like my perception of living is a bit colored by that. I just want to "re-roll my toon"(whether that works out like that is of course up to debate).

Don't worry about what you write. No need to apologize for expressing yourself. When you speak of professionals I gather you are speaking of therapists?
