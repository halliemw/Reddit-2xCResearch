Doesn't every group fight for their own rights though? I can empathize with many of the issues both here, since I'm a girl, but also there too. There are cases where good guys don't get custody of their kid even when they'd be great dads even when the mother is more unfit to parent. There are false rape accusations too. On the flip side there are absent fathers and shitty dads who shouldn't have custody and guys who rape women too. Both genders have their own, very real, unequal issues. Sadly, that is life. But why this divide, we probably should join forces and help each other out. Speaking of which, is their a sub for that at all? A sub that welcomes both genders in the name of equality?
