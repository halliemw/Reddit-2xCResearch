I feel for you. My family is similar. They're extremely religious and pre-marital sex is totally verboten. I want to encourage you to go easy on yourself about not standing up to your mom. You're still quite young and your mother is in a position of authority over you (even though you are independent). It's completely understandable that you would have a hard time standing up to her. I'm nearly 7 years older than you and I don't have a hard time getting into it with people whether they be my boss, co-workers, friends, roommates, boyfriends. But I still would have a hard time sticking up for myself in your situation. 

Furthermore, refusing to engage is a great tactic for dealing with bullies.  I've tried to give my teenage sisters advice before and when they don't respond it makes you wonder if they are even absorbing what you're telling them. It's completely maddening. While you may have felt like you were failing by not standing up for yourself it's possible that you made your mom feel like you weren't even listening to her. 

I'd be happy to talk more about this general issue with your parents if you'd like. I've been dealing with this for nearly 10 years now. Feel free to PM me.
