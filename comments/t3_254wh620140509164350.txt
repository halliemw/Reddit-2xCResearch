TwoX has always been supportive of trans woman and I don't think that's going to change from us core users of TwoX.  Give us time to show our support.  We need to actively vote, either up or down, just like we always have. I'm hoping that is we stay the course eventually we'll get back to normal. I plan on checking in often and voicing my opinions with words and votes.
