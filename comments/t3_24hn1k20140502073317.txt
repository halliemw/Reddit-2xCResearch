I think it also has to do with the fact that urinals aren't in stalls. So bringing a boy in to the women's room where everyone is taking care of their business behind a locked stall is different than bringing a little girl in to a men's room when she is unfamiliar with men's anatomy and why they're all standing up to pee. 

I'm a female, so I could be wrong but if I was using a urinal, dick in hand, beside some flimsy little blinders I would feel uncomfortable if a little girl walked in behind me opposed to a little boy who was familiar with urinal use. Men's rooms also usually have fewer stalls.
