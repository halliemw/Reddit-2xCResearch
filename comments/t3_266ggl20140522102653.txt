It's a VERY normal problem.

Now, this may be things that you already do - But this advice helped me out of exactly the same situation you were in. Basically you need to keep very clean down there, and let plenty on air into the area. 

Wear *cotton* panties - without panty lines is possible - your vulva needs air.

Sleep with *no pants or panties on*. Feels weird at first - but air to the affected area really helps.

Shower in the morning, *and after you have gone number two*. If you can't shower after going to the bathroom, wipe with wet pieces of toilet paper. 

Obviously wipe front to back - bacterial infection (even a minor imbalance) is very likely to be the problem. When you have had all these kinds of medication, your natural flora is messed up. That means you have to be extra cleanly.

Was with water, *no soap*. Especially antibacterial soap will destroy your natural balance.

IF it has been two months it might be time to go back to the doctor. See a OB-GYN! Your regular doctor knows about the most common causes, but it took a specialist for me for figure out my problems.
