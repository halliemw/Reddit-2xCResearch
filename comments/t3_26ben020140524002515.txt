I really liked your article, it was very journalistic, except for paragraph 6. You should have either provided more solid research to support that argument if you were going to use it as an example, since it can be easily disproven, such as general male dominance in a multitude of unrelated cultures and geographies including remote populations and male dominance in animals in nature, suggesting such behavior in humans is more linked to instinct/genetics than it is to culture/society.

It also feels as if part of paragraph 6 included a bit too much of your opinion. If this was much more an opinion oriented piece, that would be okay, but the general tone of the rest of the article is more of an analytic and scientific one, so because of that, it weakens your article as a whole.

Still though, this is so far much more journalistic than what you would find on most professional articles.
