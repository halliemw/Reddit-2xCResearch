I had issues with the mail, i made custom invide 'boxes' that where to spec. And thus mailable but 5-6 got 'lost', a couple returned as damaged. Same for the thank you cards a few people, mainly in new development houses said they did not recive them, some the same to not get the invite. Usps sucked ass on us. I was very thankfull people spoke up about not getting it.
