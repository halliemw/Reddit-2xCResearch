I'm concerned that you're seeing active sexual harassment so much in your field. As an aside, I do consider your case highly unprofessional behavior, but don't classify it as sexual harassment. I do hope that your acquaintances are reporting these experiences and taking active arms to prevent further harassment. It seems that my cohort is all very fortunate in not experiencing more than the "glass ceiling" or "bossy" effects of being women in engineering. On a side note, I have a young male educator for a friend who was harassed by his superiors. It's anytime where the instigator feels that they will not suffer consequences. Rarely do I think that those who do not directly experience harassment even hear of it. I really wish people were more aware of what all forms of sexual harassment can take. 

Good luck, and possibly practice firmly rejecting an approach ("Your consideration is flattering, but this is not the appropriate environment" ect.) and establish relations with the human resource person who you can direct any concerns you have early on. If you haven't mentioned this already, do so.
