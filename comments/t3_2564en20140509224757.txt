I've seriously been considering buying one of these. Are they okay to wear overnight or do you ladies who have one use a different product for sleeping? I hate pads, but tampons are so wasteful. Plus I hate that my only options are to flush it (no no for plumbing) or put it in a garbage can (no thank you). BC pills definitely normalised my cycle and flow (thank you to each and every deity of the world), so it's not like I am worried about leakage in that regard. I just wonder about leaving it in for 8+ hours and if lying down and moving around fucks with the seal. 

Edit: Another question I would appreciate input regarding, if you ladies have any, is about a tilted cervix. Do any of you know if this makes a menstrual cup less effective? My cervix is tilted downwards quite a bit, enough to make paps difficult. Anyone else in a similar position had success with these cups?
