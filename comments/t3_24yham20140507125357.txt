I've been on my current pill for over a year. This month I barely spotted during placebo week and I was nauseous. I took a test, it's negative, no big deal. Even when on the pill, stress and diet and everything else can mess with your period, so like this month when my SO's grandmother died, I have a massive, impossible-feeling take home final to do, I'd been on antibiotics for 20 days of the last 21 (using condoms of course), stress had changed my appetite and sleeping patterns, and between my class and lab schedule and my SO's work and study schedule, we'd barely had any quality time together, all of those things combined made me basically miss my period. Of course it's always best to take a test to know for sure, but stay calm, because even periods that are regulated by the pill can be a little wonky when you're stressed.
