I'm a pretty good cook, and I cook different meals all the time! I try to make the vegetables that I cook exciting, I do things like kale chips and zuchinni chips. I browse pinterest a lot looking for new ways to cook veggies. Healthy food that she likes is always available, but she doesn't ever choose it. We always have veggies and fruits in the house, but she chooses to have pudding, pretzels or cookies instead :(
