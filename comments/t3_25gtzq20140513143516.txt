I'm so happy for you!  Tampons feel so freeing when you've been using pads for so long.  My sister didn't use tampons for a few years because she was afraid of them and found them uncomfortable, but she worked beyond her fear... just like you!  Great job. :)

>Because I've never been able to use a tampon, I've never felt like a normal woman.

Don't EVER let ANYONE make you feel like how you deal with your period is abnormal!  I don't care what you use - it is entirely personal preference and you aren't any less of a woman if you don't feel like you can wear a tampon.  It's like, "Really, you don't have anything better to do than shame me for my menstrual product preferences?"
