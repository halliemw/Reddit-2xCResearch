Lego made gender specific lego because people were asking for them. The regular lego are still available and are gender neutral. I dislike these kinds of articles, if you don't like something go and fix it. Nothing is stopping anyone from going out and prototyping a toy and then raising funds for it on kickstarter to bring it to manufacturing. This article is all talk and no solutions, another fluff peace to complain about things and get nothing done. Go build your idea, market it, and let the children decide if they like it. If they like it then you are a millionaire, if they don't well then you just found out something. Be more of a go-getter like Marissa Mayer and less of a complainer like Sheryl Sandberg. The editors at this publication need to write less of these complainer pieces and more pieces on how to bring an idea to market so that women who do have an idea will know how to achieve it rather than whine about it.
