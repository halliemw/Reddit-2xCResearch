I think it was the combination of everything. Mono is pretty hard on your immune system, but the more things you have going on the more stress on your immune system.

My psoriasis is much more mild than any of the pictures you see on wikipedia etc. It's more just red or flaky-white itchy spots. It responds very well to topical steroid treatment (like, from painful to look at, covering my entire scalp and neck and part of my face, to entirely gone in < 1 week).
