> Well, you got to start somewhere and right now the hijab is not the priority western feminist make it out to be.

I completely accept that women in highly patriarchal societies need to make strategic trade-offs. I am not criticising that.

> In all religions there are commandments where no explanation for their reason is given. The closest thing the quran gives for an explanation on why women should cover up is as a symbol of faith and piousness so that they can be recognised as muslim women that follow the laws.

Actually, the Koran does state reasons, and one of them is so that women not be harassed. See 33:58â€“59. This is reasoning that is at odds with feminist ideals. Even if reasoning was not given, it does not mean that it did not come from sexism. As an extreme thought experiment, if there was a religion that believed black men should wear manacles, and walk ten feet behind white men, but just gave it as a commandment without reasoning, would that be acceptable?  

> You'd be surprised how many muslim women's right activists argue with the quran and the ahadith in their hand, demanding more respect from the men on the basis of some tenets of the faith or stories from the early years of islam.

Again, this is a sensible tactical choice, considering the fervour of religious belief in the Islamic world. Many Muslims may be willing to accept women's liberation if you can convince them it is an Islamic thing. I hope they do convince them of that. But I am just unsure whether that logic works.
