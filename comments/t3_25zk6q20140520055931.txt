I can only speak for men, but I think you've hit the societal thing right in the head. Society's expectation of aspirations of the male gender are a singular thing; for us to become men. The sooner the better. What does society expect the female gender to become? I have no clue. Perhaps I should discuss this with my adult daughter.
