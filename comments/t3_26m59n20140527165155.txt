You have a lot of really great comments here, I just wanted to add that you might want to stress that you really like your roommates girlfriend and don't have a problem with her hanging around the apartment, assuming you don't have an issue other than the fact that she appears to be living there now. I would also check and see if the girlfriend has a place of her Own and why she is not staying there. You could start off the conversation saying you notice she's been saying over increasingly and then they don't seem to be staying at girlfriends place a lot. Ask if something happened. 

I would try to stick with statements of fact. You like your roommates girlfriend, you notice she's been staying over more and more, you've noticed a spike in electricity and water use, your lease says that the apartment is being rented to x number of people, and feel that it is unfair to move in another person who is paying. 

I guess the next question you have to ask yourself is if she wants to pay part of the water utilities and rent, are you willing to let her stay? I would decide that before you start the conversation. I think asking about her situation helps as well. It's possible she is having a rough time wherever she lives, or might not have a place to live. Obviously, if you already know the details of this, feel free to ignore that.

It's not your responsibility to take care of your roommates girlfriend, but asking out of concern might at least show your roommate that you care about her well-being.
