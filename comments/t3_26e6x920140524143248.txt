I am not someone who is very uncomfortable with men at all. I am surrounded by them in my work, and I have many male friends. I can deal with being hit on, or flirty, and I often play it off as a joke. I establish VERY clear boundaries when it comes to how far I will let this go however.

This just took me by surprise. It was, to me, a breach of trust between friends. A kiss is a kiss, and if this was some random dude at a bar I'd have set him straight and on his way. I think this just affected me because it was so emotionnal.

I never though of hugging as misleading; I am just a very physical person and hugs, handshakes, and double cheek kisses are just part of my upbringing and my culture.
