While my SO is more than willing to do equal work in the house, the "invisible work" (I call it "mental work") tends to fall to me. 

We came up with a compromise for meal planning (since that's where it bugs me the most). Generally speaking, I cook and he does dishes. Since I'm the one cooking, I maintain the pantry inventory for ingredients (canned tomatoes, chicken stock, etc.); we both keep an eye on basic foods (milk, eggs, etc). Every Sunday, we go out for dinner (it's the one day a week we eat out) and do our meal planning/grocery list for the week over dinner. Then, we go grocery shopping. 

Big conversations don't work well for us; we tend to agree in theory, but without specific actions to take we just fall back into the same pattern. We've had a series of small conversations about specific subjects (ie meal planning) as they've come up. 

I think this also keeps the other party from feeling attacked - instead of "You never do any of the mental work" its "the way we do [specific subject] isn't really working for me because [reasons]. How can we do it differently?"
