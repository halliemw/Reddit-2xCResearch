Well for starters, passionate and talented teachers could teach in the inner city instead of running away to the pretty white gated suburbs, which is what OP's boyfriend is trying to convince her to do.

This is a HUGE question with lots of answers and education is one tiny facet of it all. In my personal opinion, I think voluntary residential integration would help a lot-- White people moving into areas where *they* are the minorities, not with the intention of flipping houses and making the area young and hip, but with the intention of coexisting with the people of color who are already there.  It turns out that SOOOO MANY RACE ISSUES in this country stem from residential segregation when you dig deep enough.
