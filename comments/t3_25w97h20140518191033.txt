Don't feel sad, and you are not sounding crazy. I would say just inbox me if you ever need someone to talk to. If someone doesn't want us, it means they don't want us, no matter how hard we try, but that's the truth and we have to accept it, like it or not, but hey, you can message me. I can be your friend. I would really love if you will message me.
