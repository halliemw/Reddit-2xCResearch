I noticed that you made it clear in a reply that you're interested in advice on how to talk about this, not advice on what to do. So! (I'm sorry I'm not very eloquent and I hope I don't sound preachy)

I've always been a big believer in I-statements which, from the emails, it looks like you're definitely working on ("I feel uncared for when..." "I feel silenced"). 

I just did a little googling and found this (http://www.usu.edu/arc/idea_sheets/pdf/assertive_communication.pdf) and this (http://jessicaengle.blogspot.com/2012/10/communication-skills-for-couples-i.html) which might help.

Last idea: stay calm!!! cool as a cucumber, totally neutral words and voice. Offers solutions. Don't rehash the past or list all his faults, talk about what we can do moving forward. Offer solutions. (some of this you're clearly doing: "instead of ignoring me, please just say you don't want to talk to me.") I guess for him you will also need to specify that when you come to him with a problem (or when he comes to you--if he ever does) that first, you have to deal with this problem at hand; the partner cannot rebuttal with a different issue. This isn't a pissing contest.
