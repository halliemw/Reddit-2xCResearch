They don't give a damn b/c they don't understand. PCOS is NOT well understood yet. 

I have endo and PCOS as well. I'm now 99% sure most of my pain is from endo. My Dr told me that some endo is hard to see/remove, and if you don't remove all of it, you may not get the pain relief you expect. So he may have very well removed all he saw ... Doesn't mean that's all there was. 

My Dr offered me a mirena or visanne. IUD's scare the crap out of me so I chose visanne. It's been wonderful. I really cannot even describe the relief ... I was having pain all month. I was spotting all month. I couldn't take a crap w/o feeling like my uterus was going to fall out. Even peeing (no straining required) hurt. I can go to the bathroom now w/o pain !! 

Beware of numerous surgeries to remove endo. The more surgeries you have, the more adhesions can be created, and can cause more problems (scar tissue makes things stick together requiring MORE surgery) ... especially if you're not actively trying to curb the growth of the endo.  

If you're in the US, visanne isn't avail yet, but apparently natazia is similar ...? Maybe request a second opinion ...?
