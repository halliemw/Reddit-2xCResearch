We can't educate all the yahoos. My default is to ignore/downvote the 2+2 questions. But, as someone who's also active on /r/AskWomen*, I don't want the stupid/rude questions going over there either. From my experience, AW doesn't want to answer those questions any more than 2X. The most popular posts there are women talking to women. We routinely downvote or ignore dumb questions from men, which there aren't so much aggressively anti-feminist as desperate pleas for dating advice: "Can I date you in a house? Can I date you with a mouse? Can I date you in a box? Can I date you with a fox?" or else requests for wank fodder. If we stick to OP's (perfect) analogy, it's like nobody wants to teach the remedial eighth-graders who still can't accept that 2+2=4. 

*I'm not involved enough in this sub or AW to know why we're supposed to be enemies, so I spend time on both.
