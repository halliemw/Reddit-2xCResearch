I was brought up in church for the most part. I don't think there was a time I could really call myself a christian. I am atheist but a lot of my conflicted emotions came from pretty much my entire family being strong in the Christian faith. I didn't want my family to turn away from me when I needed them most. I was just so afraid they would find out and think less of me.
