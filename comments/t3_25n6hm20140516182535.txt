There isn't a lot you can do. I usually have sunglasses and headphones on when I go out for other reasons, but it tunes out most of the douchebaggery. If someone tries talking to you, keep walking. It's like how you have to avoid the petition people on the sidewalk. If you do have to talk to someone, shut it down and keep going about your business. Example:

Sleaze: "You're beautiful."
Me: "Duh."

I'm not going to be all bashful and grateful for the attention. I know I'm hot. They're never going to get a piece of it. I'm not sorry about deflating their ego boost.

Big thing to remember: they don't care how you feel. They're doing it for themselves. They don't care that it's hurting your feelings. Apply the same logic towards them.
