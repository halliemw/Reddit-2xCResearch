You two have an understanding within an reciprocal relationship, which not everyone has. And many people will actually use those statements to undermine other people's level state of being, to provoke them in a condescending way. I'm glad your relationship isn't like that (I and my former SO could use those phrases ourselves), and I'm happy for you. But bear in mind that not everyone is that fortunate in all of their relationships.
