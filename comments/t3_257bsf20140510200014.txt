It's really nobody's business what you purchase at a pharmacy.  What really get's me, is the incidents where pharmacists have refused to fill birth control prescriptions because of their "moral" "christian" "blah blah blah."  We, as US citizens (because reddit is global and this may not apply to all redditors) need to make sure that we VOTE for legislators who will make sure that individuals (male or female) have a right to access private and respectful abortion care.  Not only should abortion be SAFE and LEGAL, but consumers need to put pressure on the major chain pharmacies to hire and train their staff to be professional, courteous and non-judgemental.  It is the LAW of this land. End rant.
