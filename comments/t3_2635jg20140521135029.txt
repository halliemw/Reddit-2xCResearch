Interesting. I have never heard of that. I know that when I "first" lost my virginity, my partner wasn't even able to insert fully because it was just so incredibly painful for me to bear. It took another try for full insertion, but even then it was incredibly painful. 

How long were you effected by it and when did it subside? How did they diagnose you?
