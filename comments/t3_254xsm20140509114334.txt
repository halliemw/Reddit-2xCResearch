Good. Then carry on doing that. I just think the TMI posts are not very helpful. 

Yes, I have been on Reddit for over two years. I just think it is too premature to make any judgments on whether this sub is still a safehaven. I haven't seen any sexist submissions coming up yet, nor too many troll posts. But I think we should wait more than a couple of days before declaring TwoX a wasteland.
