My cousin was married three years ago in a backyard wedding. It was gorgeous! Family friends helped cater, some friends photographed the day, and the reception was great without a dj and just a sound system. The decor was beautiful and was all pretty much hand crafted on a budget. It was one of the prettiest weddings I have ever been to!
