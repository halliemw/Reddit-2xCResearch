Yes, they do. She may not be able to fit into a Versace sample, but you can buy formal dresses for large sized women. If Gabourey Sidibe can look appropriately dressed on the red carpet, so can this woman.

Men do get asked who they're wearing. George Clooney gets that question. So does any other Hollywood star. Her husband just isn't that important to the people asking the questions.

*Seriously, Google "Gabourey Sidibe red carpet". She's almost always well dressed, and she's much larger than the comedian in question.
