Yeah, but notice how you're using the word sexist, not misogyny. The act of "slut shaming" targets sluts, whoever they happen to be in that specific context. It's not meaningless. It specifically distinguishes women who are "sluts" from women who aren't. The fact that different slut shamers have different definitions of the word, and that maybe every woman fits *someone's*, doesn't mean slut shamers hate women.
