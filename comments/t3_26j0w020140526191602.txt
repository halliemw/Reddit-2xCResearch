It's about fucking time people started to actually talk to men about this instead of just focusing all the attention on the pickup community and doing absolutely nothing to show any alternative view of relationships. Attacking the pickup artist community without explaining to men that it is ok to be a virgin and they are not worthless human beings because they are not having sex is just asinine and breeding misunderstanding and hatred. It's bad enough to go through life knowing nothing but rejection, but then feeling it means you are not even worthy to be a part of your gender and being told by society that you are a joke of a human being makes it even worse.
