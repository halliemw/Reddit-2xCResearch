I wish that I hadn't been so concerned with being popular -- I was constantly comparing myself to others. I spent ridiculous amounts of money on brand name clothing like the "popular" girls wore, and I went on a weight loss diet that resulted in me developing an eating disorder that would last throughout college. My self-esteem was so poor, but in retrospect, I had lots of friends and I was well-liked within my circle of friends. The sooner you learn to embrace yourself and stop worrying about what other people think, the better. Although as a 16-year-old this was really tough for me to do.
