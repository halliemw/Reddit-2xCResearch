> I am from a country where people are screaming murder and fire about the fact that women earn less in a month or a year then men. However they forget the fact the most women don't want to work full time and are more likely to take day off to see their children. Meanwhile if a man wants to take a day off to see his children it's impossible.

But why is it by default primarily the woman's responsibility to do all those career-damaging tasks parents are required to do (pick up sick kids from school, etc.)
