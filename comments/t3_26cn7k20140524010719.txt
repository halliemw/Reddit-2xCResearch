Sounds like he really trusts and values you as a sister. I would start reading some baby books (i.e., *What to expect when you're expecting*). Check out [babycenter.com](babycenter.com) and become familiar with the common topics. If you do this, it may be easier for you to answer his questions and you will be able to provide him resources that he can access on his own.
