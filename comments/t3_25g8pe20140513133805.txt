I mean yeah I take and get your point about not being to save the dead but there are literally hundreds of thousands of only male child soldiers being abducted and trained every year in Africa too but you don't hear about them anymore.... a lot of things are like this... like the Indian gang rape that happened last year - a week before a male tourist was gang raped in India but no media coverage... there are a number of reasons for this but it's mainly the media angle (women's rights/ oppression) and/or political usefulness; it sells papers and gets some parties votes - the us has had such a strong response to the recent abductions because the womens rights agenda plays very well to democratic bases and it follows up the white house's other recent forays into the gender arena... but thats just my two cents
