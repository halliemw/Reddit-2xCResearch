I had a very surreal moment for me when I was buying a computer. My boyfriend, at the time, was tagging along and was just leaning against the counter at check-out. The male cashier only spoke with my boyfriend; although he took my cash from my hand - and then he gave my change to *my boyfriend*! 

I was stunned, and actually, really angry about it. I just felt like a complete non-entity.
