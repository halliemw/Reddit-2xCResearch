At ours, it went through both. For example, an acquaintance was arrested by the UPD for underage drinking and public intoxication in the dorms. He was taken to the local hospital because he was too drunk for the drunk tank, and charges were pressed in the local court system as well as in judiciaries because it happened on university property. He received 20 hours of community service and his record was expunged from the actual legal court, and he was on probation with the university because he was found guilty there, too.
