Actually, that's quite an interesting question of artistry. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but if you've seen enough gay men (I was born in SF) you inevitably start seeing body language. Mind you, as a straight I don't have 100% perfect gaydar, but these gender-bent drawings reek of it. So much so that I could easily imagine them being done in earnest (except that most gays I know aren't quite so sophomoric as comic book audiences typically are).
