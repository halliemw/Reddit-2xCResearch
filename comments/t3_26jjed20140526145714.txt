Honestly, I recommend getting a gun. I don't mean to scare you, but the guy could have just been casing the place. Particularly if you have a big window, it would be easy for someone to walk by, see your tv or laptop or something, and try to come in for it. Those situations can turn nasty really quickly, and having a gun could save your life. 

However, owning a gun is a large responsibility, and I would only go this route if you are willing to take all the training and necessary precautions that go along with it. There is no sense in owning a gun if you don't know how to properly shoot it and take care of it.

Many cities have women-only gun safety courses, and (at least in my area) many ranges have women-shoot-free policies, and have workers who are more than willing to help you become a better shot. A good handgun isn't too expensive, and you don't need any sort of permit to own one and keep in your house (carrying in public is a different story). To purchase one, you usually have to be a resident of the state you are buying in, have no felonies or violent crimes on your record, and have not been institutionalized for mental instability (individual state laws vary, but thats the general idea). 

In the long run, I think it is worth it. My FH and I live in a really great neighborhood, but we have a gun near us every night, and we sleep a lot better for it.
