Yeah, I was down that one night and I definitely got that impression, it seemed lovely :) I'm trying to get the idea of craft nights going for us up here, I think it would bring in a big group of people that are currently missing from the space (also a night to work on my calligraphy with company would be awesome). Hopefully we'll manage it soon.

Ah I'm glad, I was worried I'd seemed really rude or something!
