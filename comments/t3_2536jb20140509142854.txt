It took me years on wellbutrin to finally realize that for ME, taking it in the morning was a big mistake. I started to take it at bedtime and immediately began to sleep better and wake up easier. Every doctor I've seen since then has been surprised that I don't take it in the morning, and no doctor thought to suggest it to me in the first place. I think my body metabolizes it slowly or something, and when I took it in the morning it wouldn't fully kick in until the evening. You're so new to it that you may want to wait it out to see if it levels off, but if not, it's definitely worth asking your doctor about switching to taking at night. Good luck!
