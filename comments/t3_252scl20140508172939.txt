That's not a bad idea. To be honest, I've never been to /r/feminism. I think that TwoX becoming a default sub is going to result a lot of less-than-educated comments about women's rights, women's issues, and possibly feminism, and because those issues sometimes overlap, it's important to be able to quickly direct users to high-quality, informative resources. 

That said, I also think it's a good idea to direct people who are looking to discuss feminism specifically to places like /r/feminism. The sidebar primer or resource link section would be for people who are commenting in a misinformed way on a TwoX thread and wouldn't want or need to be redirected to /r/feminism or the like.
