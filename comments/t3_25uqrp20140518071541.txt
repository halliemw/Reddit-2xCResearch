I'm not sure why people are jumping all over you for a terrible event that was in no way your fault. Maybe because my late sister's husband was a slime ball con artist who created himself another family while she (unable all her life to believe anything bad about anyone) lived in his web of lies, I can believe this happened to your mother.

Anyway, it's going to be a rough trip for you and your mother for a while. She has some getting-her-act-together to do, big time. See if you have a local shelter where the two of you might stay temporarily. But it's your mother who's going to have to put the trauma aside and get a job or two. Some states have agencies that help people find jobs, especially after such a major displacement - check your nearest workforce commission. (Actually your mother should do this, but you can support her in the effort.)
