I'd say yes, though you'd have to empty it every 3-4 hours on those days. It'd take some experience to learn how long it takes to fill on those heaviest days. I'd recommend using a panty liner the first few months until you get a feel for it.

There are different sizes of cups too, some have a larger capacity than the diva cup that I use. 

The real bonus IMO is two fold: On heavy days you empty less often than you'd change a tampon, and on light days, you don't get that scraped raw feeling when you pull out a dry tampon *shudder*.

Plus never having to worry about supplies. It's AWESOME. I haven't spent money on tampons in years.
