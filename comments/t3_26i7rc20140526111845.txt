 As a mod, I can assure you that we do believe that there has been an uptick in PM activity, and have no reason to doubt particular instances.

Please report any nasty PMs to the reddit admins by messaging a link to /r/reddit.com , or by clicking "report" underneath the comment. This will allow the admins to deal with this particular user, as well as give us a better idea of the scale (and sources) of the problem.
