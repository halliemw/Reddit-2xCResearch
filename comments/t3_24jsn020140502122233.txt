This is a good idea.  They may have the ability to raise concerns with the district in a way that doesn't tie back to you or jeopardise your job.

If the district is re-writing the dress code, then *someone* there either a.) understands the issue or b.) understands that a sexual discrimination suit could cost them a lot of money.  Either way, you should see some action taken if you approach it from the right angle.

I'm sorry that you (and the girls at your school) are dealing with this.  And I'm sorry that you have to *strategise* a way into creating a harassment-free workplace.
