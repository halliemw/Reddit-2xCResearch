I can relate!! I honestly cannot fathom how to not be loud during sex. It just happens naturally. My best friend once told me she hears her neighbors and that people who have loud sex are "just trying to show off". Nope. Not true.    
    
When my husband got home from his last deployment to Afghanistan, our former neighbors banged on our front door mid-WelcomeHome fuck session. -___- (It was like, 7pm - so not late - AND I was actively trying to be somewhat quiet.).    
    
Since then, I try various things to stifle myself. Sucking on his fingers helps a ton an is a sexy alternative to pillow biting and mouth covering. But yeah. Sometimes you've just gotta let loose!
