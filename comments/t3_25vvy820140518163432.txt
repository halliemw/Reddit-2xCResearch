Focus on yourself.  Once you aren't readily available if he contacts you, and keep it short to "sorry have plans" and if he asks what the plans are be generic and refocus the topic as to why it is he called. 

As far as trust in this sort of relationship with a commitment phobe, the trust is within yourself that you are a confident woman who is responsible for her own happiness.   

So if he wants something casual with him you need to be okay with that, and know it's okay for you to also see other people.  Do what you want and enjoy it!

If anything, he's definitely made it clear he isn't boyfriend worthy so I wouldn't put much emotional investment in this one.  Sure its a bummer , but he's just a dude playing the whole "well we were on a break" type loophole as another comment stated if (and most likely is) seeing someone else. 

To use the old quote "Never make someone a priority that keeps you as an option".
