Whoa, no need to be so condescending. I understand what you are saying and agree with you - and hey I come from one of those countries where women are forbidden control over their own bodies and abortions are illegal - but what Bad_QB said is perfectly reasonable. OP's boyfriend is allowed to have his own emotions and opinions about this; he's the father of the fetus after all. Ultimately the decision is 100% OP's though, since it's her body.
