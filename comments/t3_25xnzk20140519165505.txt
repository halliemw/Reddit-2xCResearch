i have a gay roommate who would probably prefer it if they did guys like this too. good idea, lets not forget to sexualize the male characters as well. but lets also not forget that these images are sexualized because that is what sells to their audience. if we disallow them to create images like this they will lose massive amounts of money. are you willing to pay these companies the millions of dollars they will lose in order to cater to you?
