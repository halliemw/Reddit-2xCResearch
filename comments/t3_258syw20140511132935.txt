With how limited (or straight up disregarded) the awareness campaigns are, many people just don't realize what they are doing may constitute rape.

I think a perfect example of this unfamiliarity was a recent speech by Amy Schumer [where she admitted to a potential rape while in college, without even realizing it.](http://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) If you read the full speech, she details how she was trying to have sex with a guy so drunk that he was falling asleep partway through.

Hearing the speech, or even just reading the transcript, it doesn't seem like much until you realize that there's no way this guy is sober enough to be giving proper consent. This is the kind of thing that probably happens every week in colleges around the country, and is why the awareness campaigns are so damn important.

It needs national attention and more than just blurbs on college websites, or pamphlets nobody reads.
