Yay for hair! My arm and leg hair isn't super dark, but I am pretty fuzzy everywhere. I got a tattoo on my back years ago and the tattoo guy had to shave my back. How embarrassing at the time! I have black hair, but my daughter ended up blonde somehow so I'm not sure how fuzzy she will end up being, but she (3yrs old) saw me getting into the shower a few days ago and asked "mommy why do you have hair on your butt!" well, when you get older, sometimes your butt just gets hairy! "oh cool! So when I'm all growm up I get to have a hairy butt too?! Wow!" lol I'm 31 weeks pregnant with my second kid now and a symtpom I never got with my first is...booby hair! Oh well, I guess it goes well with the furry legs, belly, and butt haha!
