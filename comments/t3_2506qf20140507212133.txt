Why would you do something different for boys and girls? Would the boys be learning about body image and nutrition also?  Don't get me wrong, body image and nutrition are great topics but I think they could benefit any gender! :)

Why not do something fun? Do something to encourage girls to enjoy and not be afraid of science. Maybe some hands on projects that are fun. I found some here, even more girly things like making lip balm. I know that if it wasn't for teachers encouraging me to be interested in science, I wouldn't have the career I have today!
