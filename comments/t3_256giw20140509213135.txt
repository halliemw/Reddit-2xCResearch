There was a time in my life when I was really concerned with waxing my upper lip. For a while a toughed it out, but at some point it just became too much for me to handle, or something, and I started waxing it.

Shortly afterwards, I started training Aikido, and I noticed something. A lot of the women there did have notable upper lip hair. And I was JEALOUS of them for it. Jealous that they had faced this thing and stood up to it, or something. And I realized just how stupid it was, to sit there and do something and then be jealous of women who weren't doing it. So I stopped, and yeah I have a light stash and yeah I will keep it.

Anyways, to address your topic on face-washing - I started washing my face with a mixture of honey and brown sugar, and my skin has never been better or softer. Also it tastes delicious. I would recommend trying jojoba oil instead of coconut oil for moisturizing; I have had problems with breakouts with the latter, as well.
