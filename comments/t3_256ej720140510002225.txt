I recognized you from that thread as soon as I saw your pic. I can't believe it's been two years- and I loved your line about your mother saying he saw your boobs before he saw your face. But, on a more serious note, your post was excellent about just what breast reduction entails and I've linked to it for others asking questions about the surgery.
