Well then you you could argue with those people that conception doesn't begin at life because they aren't even sentient creatures yet so neither could the woman be culpable.  The point is, all of these ridiculous arguments for policing people's bodies and reproductive rights fall apart at the slightest logic.  And you have no indication that I'm a woman, so I don't know why you said that last part.
