She knows I've told my parents, and she's okay with that because she knows they won't tell any of our friends. She's also never met them as they live halfway across the country. I would have had to have taken a step back if I hadn't told anyone else. And it is her secret 100% and I would never tell anyone else. 

She knows I'm available most nights, and messages me on FB instead of texting because she doesn't want to wake me. I don't think I've ever not responded despite that, though. Sometimes I text her first to let her know I'm awake and don't mind talking if I haven't heard from her some nights.
