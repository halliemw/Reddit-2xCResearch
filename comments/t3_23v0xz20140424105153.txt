I think you need to internalize the fact that **you do not need to explain yourself or your choices to anyone.** Ever.
You are a self-contained sovereign entity.

 You don't owe other people, especially strangers, shit. 

As for the "why" question, this shit gets me furious. 
There's a big difference between someone asking "why?" because they are genuinely confused and someone asking "Why?" because they want to force you to justify yourself and (potentially) trap you into changing your decision.

Trust yourself to know the difference. And remember that you NEVER need to justify yourself to other people.
I'm also 22F. 
I've found the best way to shut down the "why-ers" is to keep it short and sweet and stick to your decision. 

**You (about whatever decision):** No, thank you.

**The why-er:** Why?

**You:** I don't want to. 

**The why-er:** Why?

**You:** I don't have to explain myself.

What follows is usually a moment or two of silence in which you just silently stare back as the *why-er* tries to justify some rationale for their pushing your decision. They won't be able to. This is when you exit the situation.


I usually give a short neutral answer after the first *why* because sometimes people are just curious, but it does get my guard up. 
The second *why* is the red alert that this person is not respecting your autonomy. 


What happened in the parking lot is totally inappropriate. Parking lots are NOT the place to strike up a conversation, let alone pressure a young lady to change her decision after she has already clearly said no.
