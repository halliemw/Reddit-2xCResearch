My dad built the house I grew up in from the ground up, completely on his own, and was always into construction... and my mom was also always heavily involved in trades, so I've been around it my entire life. I started painting houses with her when I was 15. 

We eventually started our own company together and got into full scale reno's (installing floors, tiling, some plumbing, etc). I branched out and worked in the construction of modular buildings for a while, did some basic framing and stuff. Then I did some welding for a while (my boyfriend is an apprentice welder and he let me tinker around a bit). Then I did some Heavy Equipment Operating (got the job through a family friend). Annnd theeen I got my Rope Access Certification, which has opened up the doors for me to work on high rises! 

Basically I used my painting skills to get my foot in the door with a few companies... Then gained experience and knowledge from people around me who knew how to do other stuff. Used that experience to get more work and gain more skills, and on it goes! Suddenly I'm a Jane of all trades. :)
