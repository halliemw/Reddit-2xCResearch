I have it! I had my colposcopy about a month ago. They said there was a "high concentration of precancerous cells," during my pap. Colposcopy results came back fine, just that I have hpv. During the colposcopy, he said I may need to come back every 6 months to monitor it for the next two years. The way the results came back, be said just regular paps will be fine. 

So, I guess that's my support that it isn't really a big deal. Super common. If they said come back in a year, it sounds like there isn't much reason to be concerned.
