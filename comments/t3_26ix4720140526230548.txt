Once I even shared the thought out loud of maybe wanting to cheat it snapped me out of it. I know logically that would solve zero problems. Thank you for sharing your experience. It's so difficult to care so much for someone and feel like you're pouring a lot of energy and emotion into them and getting nothing back. In your words, it is exhausting. I'm hoping he'll be more open to us both getting some help. I'm not ready to give up yet.
