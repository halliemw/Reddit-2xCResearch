Yeah, I changed it all to "women." Initially I just had "female" in every instance. I'll blame it partly on the fact that I just typed this post up quickly on my phone while on my break at work, partly while walking back to the elevator >.>

And yes, there is a serious lack of appropriate terms for women in non-formal tones. It's those damned euphemism treadmills.
