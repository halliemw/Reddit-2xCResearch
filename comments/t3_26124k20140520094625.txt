I can't say much for the pregnancy stuff, but I can tell you that if you had a UTI, I am pretty sure you would know. It feels like you always have to pee but you can't sometimes and it is terrible. Also, if you go untreated for that it can turn into a bigger problem if the infection moves further up your urinary tract.
