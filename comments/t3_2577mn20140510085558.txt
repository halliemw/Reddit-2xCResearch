> I'm doing Black Cohosh, soy isoflavins, and Evening Primrose Oil. Anything else I can do?

The general cause of perimenopausal problems is a gradual decline in the amount of progesterone that your corpus luteums are able to produce each month. Sub-optimal thyroid activity and vitamin A deficiency are the primary culprits.

Soy is one the most potent sources for plant estrogen. Estrogen tells tissues to swell and divide. Menopause happens when estrogen-sensitive tissues get worn out and no longer respond to estrogen like they did when they were younger.

Black cohosh is probably alright, but i would be weary of the omega-6 oils. Other things you can do are to be sure to get enough protein, adequate levels of salt, extra iodine, and supplement Progesterone USP, which is identical to what the body produces for itself (birth control uses progestins, which are NOT progesterone USP).
