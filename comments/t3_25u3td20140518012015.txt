Bonus things you should learn to do: change the air and cabin filters (super easy and explained in your user manual) and mostly just reading a user manual. Learn to patch a hole in drywall and save some security deposit money when you move out. Learn the basics of using wrenches, pliers, socket wrenches, screwdrivers, and hammers, and when to use what. If you become familiar with those and how to read a manual, you'll be able to take care of lots of little home and car repairs and home improvement projects.
