I know how you feel! I interviewed two days ago for a promotion at work and because I was nervous (because I really want the position) and my interview started 20 minutes late, I was really thrown off my game and didn't give the best interview I could. I'll find out by tomorrow, and I've been really anxious and sick feeling. I'm pretty convinced I didn't get it but we will see. Hopefully it works out for both of us!
