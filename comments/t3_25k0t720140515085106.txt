Okay! Doctors who tell their patients the IUD has been linked to infertility still get a black mark in my book, because that's not particularly true anymore. Also, the rate at which they're dislodged is low.

I'm not saying this to convince you to use an IUD, just to erase myths. If you want Depo, go get Depo. Just maybe also talk about Nexplanon/Implanon first, because it has higher success and patient satisfaction rates.

Glad to hear your mom is up for discussion; I got the wrong picture from your comment.
