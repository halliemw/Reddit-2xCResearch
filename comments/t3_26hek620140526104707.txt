It was made with a simple black crepe silk that I picked out and she made it in that sort of shorter robe style so it only goes to about the top of my knees, but the fabric itself and the way it feels is what makes it so heavenly, plus that it has some of her TLC woven into the seams. :) 


She's too good to me.
