I think that after the hiccup with the awfulness, it will probably be worth it because more respectful users interested in discussing women's perspectives will find 2x. 

However, I don't think the role of 2x is to educate people. There's /r/feminisms, /r/askfeminists, /r/eli5, and /r/askphilosophy (there was someone asking why people should be equal anyways). If I remember correctly, the last survey said women are like 30-40% of redditors, but the horrible responses to finding out that a user is a woman probably makes it harder to 'present' as a woman. 

If redditors end up bringing that attitude to 2x, then the default would be a bad idea. Doubling the number of and rotating the defaults would probably mitigate the damage. When this all blows over, it might be good to have these new users and their perspectives. ^(Can you tell I'm an optimist.)
