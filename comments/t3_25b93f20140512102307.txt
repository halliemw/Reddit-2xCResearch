https://exhaleprovoice.org/ is a completely NON POLITICIAL, NON BIASED site. I highly recommend this to anyone, whether you've had an abortion, are considering one, or even just want to understand better the experiences of women who have been through one. 

"Silent No More" tends toward shaming those who have had abortions, and/or an overall anti-abortion attitude - it is definitely not unbiased. As a local clinic defender, I've seen that particular site both touted and advertised for women "suffering the shame of abortion" constantly. 

"Abortion Changes You" is similarly biased but the shaming is less obvious. 

Both of those sites start with the assumption that abortion is a negative thing. No site can claim to be unbiased which does this. The first site you mentioned does look like a good resource though, I am going to look at it more and see about adding it to our list of resources for women. Thanks for sharing that.
