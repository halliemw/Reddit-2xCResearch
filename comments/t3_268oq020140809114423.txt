I'm very happy with it now! I still do have some spotting, but it's usually only for a day and every couple of weeks. I still haven't had a full blown period. I feel a lot happier and able to get up in the morning, and a lot less snacky--I think that probably has something to do with the birth control pills finally leaving my system. 

I don't notice that it's there and neither does my husband. It was a great choice! 5 years of this, I really can't complain. :)
