It also is different depending upon the strata of the population being studied.  You can dice by ethnicity, by socioeconomic status, by housing status, by education level attainment, by disease burden.  You'll get different rates within strata with each.

For example, a study on homeless/insecurely housed women found that the sexual violence rate was something like 60%, or about 3 in 5.
