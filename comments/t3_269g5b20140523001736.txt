Thank you so much for sharing.  I think just finally admitting to myself that this is a real thing that happened to me is hitting me hard, but sharing kind of makes it easier or more normal or something.  It is just helping me accept that something bad happened to me and I can get help and get better.  Right now it sucks though and hearing your success story helps me to see the light at the end of this journey that I am just beginning.  So thank you again.
