It really depends on the company. I have been a graphic designer and art director for 15 years. At one time I worked for an in-house marketing department for which I was considered marketing staff. At another point, I worked in-house for a staffing agency for which I was considered admin staff; in fact, my boss was the head of Administration and I answered to her, as did the receptionist and the HR assistant.

So while GD is not on its own considered an admin job for the most part, it is often times lumped into admin in non-agency style businesses.
