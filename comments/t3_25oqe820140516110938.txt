> People find it hard to believe that Joe, the nice guy down the hall, could do something so evil 

I think this is a huge part of the problem. We societally still portray rapists as inherently evil. Like the choice to rape is a permanent character trait (and I'm not trying to be apologist here), but I think this makes it harder when we are confronted with a person who is otherwise wonderful who has raped someone. I wish that we could reframe it to be more like drunken driving. It's a decision, it's a terrible decision with grievous consequences, it's a terrible decision that should have serious legal repercussions. This shift I think would be good because it would allow us to look at our charming affable friends who we *like* and think are good people and recognize that they can make terrible decisions. We wouldn't have to reconcile people we *like* to being very bad people. 

I got super rambly, but I hope the point is made.
