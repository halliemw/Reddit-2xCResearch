I'm glad this was said.  It certainly wasn't clear.  The entire situation is entirely fucked up, but it wasn't as bad as raping someone and then caning them for that "sex," which actually does happen in some places.  

Does make me wonder if 100% of the group of 8 men were single however, or if their rape of her didn't "count" as adultery.
