Depends what you mean by magical... spiritually significant? No (at least not by my reckoning). Truly, earth-shatteringly, brilliantly, wonderful? Yup. Possibly. Depends on the guy. My first time kinda sucked, but later attempts with better people were awesome, so I count from there and call that failed first attempt an *un*dressed rehearsal (since, as others have mentioned, virginity isn't *really* a thing except on your scorecard).

There are really only three things to think about:

* Do your non-penetrative FwB activities work well for you? Is he a generous and giving lover? (And are you likewise in return?) If so, go for it, if not it might be worth looking for someone is, or making the effort to be more generous yourself, because it should be a team effort, not a service relationship.

* Do you really want to have sex with *him* or do you just want to have sex? I mean, no problem if it's just the sex, but, personally, I've always found that when it's a targeted desire, it's mindblowing, while general horniness tends to just be scratching an itch - it's still great, but it's greatness that can be achieved alone as well as with another.

* Make sure you both know where you stand in advance of taking this step. Sex has some pretty strong bonding effects, and if one of you falls in love, it could lead to some serious heartache. If you're clear from the start that it's just casual, it'll still cause heartache if one of you falls, but nobody can say they weren't warned, and nobody can (reasonably) take offence if it's unrequited.

-edit-
There are really only *four* things to think about...

As others have said, make sure he's trustworthy and respects you, for obvious reasons.
