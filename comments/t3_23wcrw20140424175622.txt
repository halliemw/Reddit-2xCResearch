My dermatologist has always said that if there's one product I should buy over and over again, it's sunscreen. She always told me the best way to prevent wrinkles, is applying sunscreen and avoiding the sun. I personally use La Roche Posay 50+, it offers high UVA and UVB protection, doesn't clog my pores and goes well under my tinted moisturizer. It leaves a white-cast on but I really don't mind. 

I'm 26 and after 6 years of applying sunscreen religiously, I have smoother and younger looking skin than my 23 year old sister. 

So -- if you're not wearing sunscreen already, get started on that. If you're not sure which one suits you best, check out MakeUpAlley, our the subs dedicated to skin care or makeup here on Reddit. 

Good on you for being proactive on this! Your skin will thank you later on.
