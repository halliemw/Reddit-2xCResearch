I just want to chime in that prenatal/antenatal depression is a real condition and many women don't know about it. It is also possible to develop PTSD after a miscarriage, traumatic labor/birth experience etc. 

I'm glad you reached out to your PPD group counselor, she should have good resources for you. Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy. You can do this!
