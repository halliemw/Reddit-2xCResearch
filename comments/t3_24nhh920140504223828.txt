>Nit picking trying to disregard my argument because you can't actual prove it wrong. How very typical.

I didn't know we were *having* an argument so er... yeah, sure. A discussion about definitions tends to be pretty nitpicky by it's very nature, but you're fundamentally misunderstanding or purposefully misrepresenting the definition in front of you. Correcting this misunderstanding seems more than a nitpick to me, but it's subjective I suppose.

>I was giving the sentence which included men which you seemed to conveniently miss.

You mean the one where you bolded male? I already addressed how that is irrelevant to your point. Not going to retread.

>. Oh and what is this "society" that seeks to give men all this power? Are they the same people who are supposedly going to take away all the guns?

Dunno what the fuck you're getting at here, so uh... ooookay. Gun control is kinda irrelevant to the conversation. 

>Yes I very much disagree with patriarchy in the western world and find it very offensive. Men are put in power and given privilege by these mysterious people in charge and they just oppress every woman. So nothing ever the fault of women. No we're just weak and don't have any control over our actions.

Again, you're ignoring the definition you've quoted and are randomly supplying an outside one. Not sure where you got it or if you just made it up yourself. Besides, I just wanted to clarify an apparent misunderstanding of the term and let you form your opinion based on the correct definition. Not here to argue whether the patriarchy is real or not - I'm not exactly a feminist scholar.

Anyway, if you're determined to stand by your own definition, that's your prerogative, but it's going to be confusing when you try to discuss the topic with people using a different meaning of the word.
