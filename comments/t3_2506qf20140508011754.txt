Mental illness is a good topic, but I come from a school that had absolutely no psychiatric or counselling services. Talking about GSM issues would also be great as well because I know a lot of girls, myself included, struggle and have struggled with finding acceptance as queer individuals, particularly as bisexual/pansexual because it's often seen as something done for the attention of men.
