I'm really sorry this happened to you. It sucks that you're still feeling the pain of this situation so long after it happened. I'm not sure what steps you've taken to try and sort out your feelings, but have you considered that "getting past it" doesn't have to be some Herculean mental and emotional struggle that you undertake all by yourself? Therapy might be a useful tool in reprogramming your reaction to what happened and also your thoughts and feelings about yourself and relationships. I've definitely had the experience where either a) I can't convince myself that my logic is bad, and so I let myself persist in negative thinking because from some warped internal perspective it "makes sense", or b) I can know cognitively that my emotions shouldn't be happening but my cognition has no impact on my feelings. I've found that talking to people who are professionally trained to help me see my own negative thought patterns has been really helpful in moving past them. Just a thought! Whatever you decide to do, much luck and we've got your back. :)
