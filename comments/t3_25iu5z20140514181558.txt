> if you're not comfortable sitting down with someone casually do not expect to be comfortable sleeping with them

that's really really solid advice. The other times I've just hooked up, there was at least a degree of comfortability through talking and such but thank you for that! 

I'm 19, so yes hahah there is tons of growing to be had, and I think I'm trying to explore different facets of that growing, one of them having casual sex and leaning into this concept that causal sex is okay. The 8 year age difference is from me being 19 and him being 27, so what do you feel/think about that? 

I know I'm having a ton of conflicting feelings, which was only worsened by this particular experience. I don't think I want a serious, long term committed boyfriend, but I think I feel like I'm lacking a deep emotional connection with someone, a connection that's different, no matter how you explain it, than a connection with a close friend/best friend, and typical comes from being in a committed relationship so those are totally conflicting desires which I still have to figure out hahaha

But thank you thank you for this
