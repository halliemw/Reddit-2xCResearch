Having been the fat chick being used before, I can say, in my opinion, you're with someone who is using you for a good time, and who would never change the type of relationship he has with you. And that's okay -- IF it's what you want, too. But it sounds like you have doubts, and if that's the case, you need to pump the brakes on the friendship. You can still be friends -- maybe, depending on how his seeing others makes you feel -- but not sleep with one another. Just start by being unavailable when he wants to get together. Someone who WANTS to see you will always make time and extra effort to see you. If he doesn't do those things, you are best moving on to find someone who does. Unfortunately, I think if you continue the relationship at status quo, you may end up hurt worse than you think you will.  I wish you the best.
