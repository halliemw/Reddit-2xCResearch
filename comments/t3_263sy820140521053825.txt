That you for explaining. This is a key thing that you should make clear to anyone you want to sleep casually with. That's why I asked. 

Relationships take many forms, and can be healthy without fitting into some mould. You could have a relationship with feelings and not have it fit with whatever people have told you a relationship has to be, and just make it work for you. 

That said, trying to divorce sex from feelings completely seems a little...sad? I appreciate that you have far more information and time with your decision about this than any of us random internet strangers, but it's not a bad thing to explore the why as well as the how of this moral quandary.
