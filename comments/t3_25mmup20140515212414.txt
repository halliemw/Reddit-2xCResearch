Where I work, there are laws that we (as a university) must have police and must have frontline responses to complaints.  We also have to publish our police reports monthly.

We have sworn, uniformed police (with ostensibly the same training as other police - I actually think ours are better than the surrounding police, but each campus varies; I know campuses who are deep into cover-up and I dislike them intensely).
