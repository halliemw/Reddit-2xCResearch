It's not really harassment, per se.  It's offering what looks like several options, when it's only one option and they give a woman immediate housing and 24 hour companionship.

More like brainwashing, unless of course, that's what the woman wanted to begin with.

Planned parenthood still presents the adoption option; these "planned pregnancy" cottages do not.
