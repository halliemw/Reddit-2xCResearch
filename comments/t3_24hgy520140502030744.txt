I never experienced pain!! That isn't good at all... were you breaking the seal in order to remove it first?

Hymens are torn in many many ways including riding a bike. I wouldn't worry about that one :)

I understand the praise, because when it DID work in the few occasions, it was wonderful. But the pros just didn't outweigh the cons :(
