Sometimes this can be a positive for me though. I'm in charge of the bathrooms and sometimes let them get really rank before cleaning. I was looking at the black crap on our sink last night wondering why my SO hadn't pushed me to clean it yet, when I remembered the state of his bathroom when we first met. He just doesn't see the grime as much as I do.
