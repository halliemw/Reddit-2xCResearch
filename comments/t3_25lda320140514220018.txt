> My husband tells me I am beautiful, but I can't help but think he is too biased to tell me differently

Beauty is subjective.  If no one else thought you were beautiful but your husband, would you prefer it to everyone thinking you were beautiful but your husband?  I'm not saying you aren't allowed to be dissatisfied with your appearance, but personally?  My wife and I both hate it when the other disparages herself.  "Be nice to my baby," I'll tell my wife.  "No one gets to be mean to her.  And that includes her."

You're welcome to change up some things.  But try to understand that this man *loves* you and wishes he could make you see you the way he does.  You say he is too biased to tell you differently... do your friends tell you you're beautiful?  Your mother?  Your siblings?  Does one stranger tell you you're not?  Why on Earth would you believe that stranger over all those people who love you and tell you how beautiful you are?  I don't know you.  But this sentiment is expressed a lot by women, I think, even when all these people in their lives love them and think they are beautiful people and tell them so.  It makes me sad.
