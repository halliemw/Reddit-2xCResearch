I can't even imagine how awkward women have it when they go to have these things done. I am one who personally hope the no hair fad fades a bit and hair makes a comeback. I used to be a shaver, but it is just always so irritated from the rubbing against another during sex. Letting it grow natural is much less irritating and since it is so rare now, I find myself even more turned on by my girlfriends bush.
