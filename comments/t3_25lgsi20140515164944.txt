as someone who had a heartbreaking LDR breakup last year, there needs to be an end date for the LD part of the R. Or at least a target that can be worked towards. Due to immigration issues, we didn't have that end date, and that made things even harder. 

It's sucky when you break up not because you fell out of love or someone's infidelity, but because of shitty circumstances. 

Good luck :)
