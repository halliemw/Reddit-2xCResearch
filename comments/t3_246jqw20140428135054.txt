I feel ya. I have that problem too (depression and used negativity to motivate myself). I'm working on both things and here are some of my ways of getting myself to do stuff. 

- Plan stuff for right after work, so that you don't have time to go home. Once I get home during the week it's much harder to go out again. If you do have to stop home, no sitting or taking off your shoes. 

- You don't need a gym to workout. I workout at home because then I can do it whenever I want, I don't have to wear pants and no one is watching me huff and puff and get sweaty. I do body weight exercises, using a pull up bar but I can't remember the link for that (I'll try to find it when I am home):

/r/xxfitness has some good suggestions as well

- If you spend a lot of time thinking about all these things; when the thought first crosses your mind, ask yourself, can I do something about this right now? If you can't do your best to push it aside. If you can, doing it right now with no more thinking. The putting it off mentality takes time and stress. This sort of thinking change doesn't happen overnight but sometimes getting the ball rolling leads to more action.

- Energy and mood can change a lot. So if you have one good week, where you are getting stuff done and the next one is more meh and your own habits, that's normal. Give yourself space to have off days. If you can, do small maintaining stuff that doesn't take up as much energy. 

- Right now you see all your problems as this huge pile that seems connected. Try to seperate the distinct problems you are facing and then set a couple managable goals so as not to overwhelm yourself. I have a lot of trouble with this, because there is a lot of waiting around at my job, so I do a lot of planning but then when I get home, I don't have nearly enough energy to do everything on my list. 

- See the small things you are doing in terms of something you completed instead of comparing it to what still needs to be done. 

Lastly, you have already taken a big step in the right direction. Recognizing the problem and searching for strategies is a big step. A lot of people would rather stay in stasis and not confront these things at all. Good luck with everything!
