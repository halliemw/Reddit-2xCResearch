It's not ok, however, when you're in 7th grade and you unknowingly step in dog shit right before entering a classroom. I had it dripping off my pants leg.. it was some deep dog shit I guess. The rest of my middle school years, I was known as the kid who shit his pants, and it was just dog shit. Obviously has a different smell, but.. well... 12 year olds
