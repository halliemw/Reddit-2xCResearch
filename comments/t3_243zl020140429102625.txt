I've had chronic UTIs since I was a baby, so there's one factor. The next is I'm his first, so if there's anyone who would need testing out of us two, it would be me! He's my second though - but he's the best. Goddess, I love him. X3



Anyway, I do appreciate the worry! And I know you weren't trying to be jerky by emphasizing boyfriend. :)
