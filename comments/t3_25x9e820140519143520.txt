> anybody who behaves like this isn't going to pay attention to a one hour workshop, they aren't gonna stop being non-consent touchy with ladies because a lecturer/most likely lady told them not to.

In the end thats why they don't work.  Some lecture isn't going to convince a rapist not to rape.  If you are the kind of scum who would do something like that some mandatory lecture isn't going to change your behavior in any way.
