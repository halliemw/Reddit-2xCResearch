Sorry, I directed that post at the wrong person. Though to be fair, your response had nothing to do with the post you replied to.

I do get that I shouldn't take what they said personally but honestly what they were saying was insulting, even if they didn't see it that way. By mentioning that I wrote a paper about female friendships it meant that the topic is important to me, but these two people tried to undermine it by implying that friendships between women, especially at my age, is just drama filled and superficial. Ignoring any larger social meaning that might have, they didn't even consider I myself might have close friendships and thus take offense to that opinion. If I took it as an 'attack', or at the very least an insult, I don't really feel like that's wrong.
