I thought I'd hide it from my mother for quite some time (we were not close and I hid everything else from her... /r/raisedbynarcissists type mom). I ended up telling her immediately. Not sure why other than being in shock I guess. 

I was scared of tampons because the instructions confused me, so I thought I'd use pads. HAH. I tried one pad and it was so gross and uncomfortable that I immediately swapped it out for a tampon. 

I thought there would be a lot more blood. My mom used to make fun of me because I didn't like watching graphic, bloody television by saying "What are you going to do when you get your period and have to deal with that blood?!" so I assumed it'd be a lot worse than it was.
