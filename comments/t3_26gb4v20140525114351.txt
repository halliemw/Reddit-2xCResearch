If you look a bit deeper (http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26el4o/the_pickup_artist_communitys_predictable_horrible/) , he's also part of the Pick Up Artist group (PUA) and also part of the antiPUA group (probably because the pickup artist groups didn't work). And some--probably the ones he identified with (not all, again, not all) people in that group view women as "targets" and trophies. They completely focus on conquest of women and their ability to get sex as the defining point of their manhood = worth.

But really, the guy's just fucking messed up. HE is just messed up, and HE is the problem. 

I think "nice guys" need to proclaim that they are nice because they don't have anybody else saying it about them. I'm not talking about all guys, but it's the same as that co-worker/friend who says that s/he is all great at ________, but is actually the worst at it.
