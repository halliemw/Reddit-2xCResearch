I'm pale with dark hair and had the same issue with having a dark shadow even after shaving. I got a cheap-ish (~$34) but decently rated epilator off amazon and after the first week of using it, that shadow seriously started going away. I do make sure to use exfoliating gloves in the shower a few times a week to prevent ingrown hairs and so far haven't had much of an issue with ingrowns at all.

Honestly, I'm pretty sure no one was ever looking that hard at my armpits to begin with, but I do feel more confident now. If you have the money to spare I'd suggest trying the epilating + exfoliating combo.
