Girl, I've been asked if I'm pregnant when I turned down going for sushi for lunch. I'm allergic to seafood.

Also when hungover (no I'm not pregnant, I just drank too much beer last night), have the flu (no I'm not pregnant, I'm sick!), when I have an appointment and come in late....

It's ridiculous. It's slowing down now that I'm older, but yeah. It happens a lot.

Either way, touching you without consent is NOT OK.
