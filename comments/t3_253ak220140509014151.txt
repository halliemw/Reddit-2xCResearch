There's this interesting thing that happens. 

When I "walk strong" as you said, I get stuff yelled at me but it's more along the lines of stuff supposed to tear me down. Like "negative insulting stuff. You know, like "Bitch, lemme show you what a man is", "Cunt, I'll fuck you up", stuff like that.

I call them "I'll fuck you up" comments.

As opposed to the "I'll fuck you" comments.

Which I get if I'm dressed less businessy or maybe I look more timid. If I forget to put my bitch-face on. Or if I wear a girly dress or something. They're more like "positive" insulting catcalls. "Damn baby you look good, you can get it!", or just those gross noises they make, you know the ones.
