It is your dress, not her dress. Sounds like she is lacking in tack and should learn how to give an honest opinion without being a jerk about it. She probably meant well, but you just don't shit on someones choice like that. 

My opinion:  I think that dress is very pretty and looks nice on your figure. I like how it is unique with the flounce/ruffles on the side. While I am not a ruffles kinda gal, I think this is a perfect dress for someone who is. If you are still concerned about some of what your friend said consider going for a more simple veil. It will help balance the fullness of the dress. 

Oh, and it looks nothing like a damn doily. This dress looks like a doily:
