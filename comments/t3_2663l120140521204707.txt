The thing (problem?) with art is that it’s always open to interpretation, and making it provocative isn’t always looked on as something negative as art, even comic books, can be used as a medium to push boundaries and inspire debate. So arguing that the artwork is misogynistic probably won’t fly too far, especially in an artistic medium which is renowned for sexualizing its characters, as it’s kinda like arguing that water is too wet. You could dig in for a fight with M, but he’ll probably just dig his heels in because if he was going to take D to task over this, he would have done it by now.

Sucks to be in your position. All I can think of is perhaps offering an alternative meetup for your friends in the group and the girls who were driven away. You can lay out your own agenda for the group, and that way there won’t be any grounds for that kind of art to be displayed.
