I try to track down my kitty so I can feed her before I go to bed, but she knows my routine so well, she usually finds me first. I go take a bunch of meds (six pills and a massive injection) then drink a large cup of water. I brush my teeth then use a makeup wipe to clean my face. Then I track down my iPad and turn on Netflix to a sitcom. I make sure all doors are locked and the lights are off, then I go into my bedroom and lay down, usually to the soothing sounds of 30 Rock. I set my alarm and fall asleep quickly. My cat usually comes and lays on my head.

I sound a bit cliche, don't i?
