Just so you know, you inspired me so much that I (the worlds grumpiest person in the morning) actually got up early and tried again.  To call it running or jogging is an overstatement but I didn't quit and picked my feet up for the whole distance.  The fact that old ladies could have walked faster than me wasn't the point.  Thank you for reminding me that we all have different abilities.
