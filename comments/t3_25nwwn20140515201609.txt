I was relatively close with one of my teachers in college, he was a larger guy. A year later, I was visiting campus, and I see him. Well, about half of himâ€”considerable weight loss.

I exclaim to him, "Where's the rest of ya?! Look'n good!" He chuckles, continues on his way. 

I bring up his weight loss to another teacher, and it turns out he was seriously ill with cancer. 

I don't bring up weight loss anymore. Also, I'm too nervous to ask around about him now, I have no idea how he is :(
