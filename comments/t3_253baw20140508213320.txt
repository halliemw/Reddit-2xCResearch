I am pretty sure I have I as well. I had similar symptoms, but birth control pills help me immensely. I have talked about it with a couple of different gynecologists, and they both agreed that I probably do have endo, but the only way to tell for sure is through laparoscopic surgery and there's no need to do that if the BC is taking care of my symptoms.  

It would be nice to have a bit more of an answer, considering even without symptoms I don't know what all it's messing with in there. But, I can't complain too much because I know there are lots of people who have trouble managing their symptoms and don't have a choice but to have the surgery!
