Thank you for the reply. This is an interesting outlook on the situation, and I could definitely see where on an instinctual level the confirmation bias comes into play. It does apply to a lot of situations.

However, I hate being mean to the guys that show interest in me. Despite my frustration I try to be both clear and adamant about my disinterest  while not making them feel wrong for asking me out. I don't want to create a situation in which they feel ashamed to ask women out because of constant negative outcome. 

I just wish there was a way to constructively communicate that the initial approach is not necessarily effective without being a bitch. It's not  their interests that is a problem but rather the way that they approach the situation. 

Then again, every woman is different. Some women prefer that kind of attention, and I'm sure that if I wasn't in a committed relationship, I wouldn't feel so negatively about it. 

I guess I just don't understand men.
