> I thought that the applicator was supposed to stay inside of you. 

Ahhh I thought I was the only one who had done this! I was at work one day and needed something and all they had were tampons in one of those little coin operated vending machines... I tried putting the whole thing inside, got confused as to why it was so uncomfortable/painful and ended up using toilet paper instead until I got home. 

Figured out the whole tampon thing a couple of years later and was much happier!
