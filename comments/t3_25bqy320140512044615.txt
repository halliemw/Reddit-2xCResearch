Yes, I always feel vulnerable when walking home. Men can also be victims of hyper-masculinity. I don't live in a particularly dangerous area at all but have been physically assaulted twice while walking home, just minding my own business. It is something I'm mindful of all whenever I'm walking in public.

I'm also overweight and can sympathise with what it is like to have abuse hurled at you in public. It is humiliating. Especially in crowded areas. The comments are rarely in the form of sexual harassment though and I can only imagine the extra distress that would cause. I really wish that people could just be respectful of others and their right to exist, even when their body shape doesn't confirm to society's standards.
