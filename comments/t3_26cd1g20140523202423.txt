'I love you' means a hell of a lot. Tell her about yourself and things you want to do, how work/school is going, stuff in the world that's going on that she might be interested in. Ask her any questions you want to know about her life while you still can. Hold her hand and read to her, or even sing to her! Say thank you for being an awesome grandmother. 

Most importantly, don't stress about it too much. Just spend time with her. Your Gram looks like an awesome lady. :)
