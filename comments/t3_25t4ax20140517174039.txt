So glad to hear your experience was relatively easy and painless.

I've not been shy about sharing my own experiences but really wanted to highlight the ibuprofen vs. other painkillers/sedatives/whatever else.  My experience with just ibuprofen was not at all bad.  Totally doable though definitely not comfortable.  By comparison, having an IUD inserted was worse.  I've also been told that others have not been able to handle it with OTC pain meds and I don't know if that's a variable between doctors and how gentle they are, physical anatomy, individual thresholds or something else.  It can definitely vary from one person to the next.  Personally, I would have preferred more but that wasn't an option since I drove myself there and because the clinic had other responsible party to release me to, they weren't able to give me "the good stuff".

On the other hand, I sat in the recovery area next to another woman who spent most of her time puking into a bucket.  When I asked a nurse if she was okay, she said that's often a side-effect of valium.  So I think I got off kind of easy in that there was none of the nausea and ibuprofen was sufficient.  Every woman and every experience varies an awful lot.  Again, I'm happy to hear yours was positive one.  :)
