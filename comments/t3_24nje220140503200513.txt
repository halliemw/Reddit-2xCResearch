I was considered an "early bloomer", as I started going through puberty probably when I was 9, but didn't get my period until I was 12, almost 13. I would definitely inform her about everything that *could* happen soon (like periods, body hair, breasts, etc.). Just make sure that she has all the resources she could want (my mom bought me lots of books on puberty, which was super embarrassing, but worked) and lots of support!
