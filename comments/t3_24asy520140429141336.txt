Well I don't know if this is possible for you (your age/living situation could complicate it) but I refuse to have any contact with my creepy uncle. I told my mother why and told her I would not attend any family events that he was also attending. Actually a few days ago she tricked me into having to see him by saying he wouldn't be someplace when he was. I flipped out on principle, but it wasn't that bad for me (as I think at 22 I'm about 15 years too old for him-yuck!) You can bet, however, that when I have children he will never lay eyes on them and if my mother can't respect that then she will lose out on having a relationship with her grandchildren just like she is going to lose out on having a relationship with me.
