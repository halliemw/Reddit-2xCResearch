I don't think I'm weird or different, and I don't know why you're saying that. I'm a hard working person, and I'm as friendly as most people in general. I'm not really looking for friends, I just want to feel like a part of the company, because, well, that's what I am. I also wish to be treated with respect and a professional attitude, which is exactly what I give them.
