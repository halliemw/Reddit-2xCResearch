Yeah, I really dislike it too. More fundamentally, it's an ego thing, someone believing they know everything and others know nothing. I have occasionally seen women do this using their lack of privilege as a justification for why they should be considered experts. Fortunately, they are not most women.

I wish we could just go back to calling people know-it-alls? Or sarcastically dismiss them by saying, "Yeah, you think you know everything, don't you?" Or just outright say to them, "How could you possibly know that?" And then grill them to death on the methodology and robustness of every single one of their claims? Use their tactics against them, make them wonder whether they actually did something outrageously stupid and are just embarrassing themselves while you stay cool and collected, and so on and so forth?

Maybe this isn't the best solution, but it seems better that compressing everything down to a dismissive word we can fit in our sock drawer.
