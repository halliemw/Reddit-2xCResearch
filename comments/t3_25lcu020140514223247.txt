It's incredibly obvious!  I actually have no idea what kind of bike I got.  I'm guessing that because I got it from Costco, it's probably not something all that fancy/expensive.  It's currently sleeping in the handy-dandy bike room in the basement of my apartment building as I've signed a contract not to have bikes in my living space (or on the new carpets in my building's hallways).  

What kind of bike do you have?
