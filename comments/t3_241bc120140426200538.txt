Oh man, I hope that happens too! It scares me that my Tech school has seen a decline in female freshmen in the past 4 years though... Not good.

I did a BS in Mechanical Engineering but ended up in RF engineering. Now I design indoor cell networks and use none of the curriculum I learned in school. The problem solving skills are invaluable though!
