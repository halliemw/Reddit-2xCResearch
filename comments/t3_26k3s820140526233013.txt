To be truthful, the amount of misogyny (especially if you count its more subtle forms) is greater than at any time in the last 100 years.  My opinion only.  I'm not 100 yet, I studied a little history, I listened to my family and friends (my grandmas were born in the 1880s').  

If they or my mother's generation (or my own generation - and we were far more jaded) had had to put up with what today's younger women see and hear on a daily basis...well, let's just say that most of you are pretty sturdy.  

The change needs to be more than within ourselves, it needs to be within the broader culture as well.  If the word feminism is dead, then we can invent another one (we invented that one).

Women are very good with words.  But maybe we don't need another 'ism.  

There are words we could use that are already current (like ethical).  Being ethical, weighing consequences, looking at how one's actions affect others, that's all I ask.
