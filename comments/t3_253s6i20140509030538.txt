> You get to about 38 cm at around the time you give birth...I measured 72

I'm a doctor who's worked in obstetrics and I just burst out laughing at that. You poor woman!

There is so much wrong with your story though D: rupture of membranes with that much fluid should be SO controlled, the risk of prolapse is incredibly high. And your risk of post-partum haemorrhage is extremely high (so much stretching means the uterus will have a hard time contracting back down).

And I can attest to "blown up octupus", I once stood at the foot of a woman getting her 4th degree tears sewn up. I'm sorry :(
