Hello. I'm from The Red Pill and, therefore, you should dismiss anything in my post as misogynistic, hate-inspired lies! Well, with that caveat out of the way, now for a response. 

TRP has taught me a lot, most of it I wish I knew when I was 20. I could sit here and spout off for hours about how when I was around 20, I did the whole be yourself and be nice thing and what it got me. It got me used. Well used. I'd even appeal to girls about what I was doing wrong and, being female, you know exactly the responses I got. Your post is the equivalent of the male 20yo virgin who no girl wants to fuck but always want to hang out with. Ironic I guess. 

Right now I'm over 30, split off from a 10 year LTR which was, well, mind crushingly abusive and also cost me every friend I ever had and communication with my Mom. It was more than worth it though. And yes when I say abusive, I mean her to me, not vice versa. I feel the need to state that explicitly as usually people see "abusive" and "relationship", it must be the guy who is the fist-swinging animal.

TRP would have you believe as you say; any single and over-30 woman is likely to have ridden the cock carousel and fucked over and used a whole bunch of beta guys. And it's not very difficult not only to see why this belief is rife within the red pill, nor is it difficult to actually experience this in real life as a man. In fact most girls over 25 I've had the pleasure of over the last year have many beta orbiters that jump through any hoops these ladies set them! And they use it well! A few times, one girl in particular had her beta drive her to my flat, he went off to hide somewhere, after we were done, she texts him for a ride home! I mean... shit... It's like looking at a mirror of myself when I was young and stupid! I feel sorry for the guy, but whaddya gonna do! 

There's various explanations for what you're saying. Guys do go for younger girls. In my case, I couldn't get any of these fine-ass girls when I was younger. There was no playing the field for me simply because I was "such a nice guy". This despite claims that I'd "find someone eventually" and that any girl would be "so lucky to get me"... It makes me cringe even now!

The way I see it, now I'm older and a bit better built, now I see all the above was simply because I was a pussy and now that I truly don't give a shit about their feelings or happiness, these fine ass 20yo  girls are actually pretty easy for me. In many cases, they do the chasing! I don't fully understand it if I'm honest. I wouldn't say I was the best looking guy in the world, not even close. But if they're chasing, welp, I can't run that fast! Call it filling in the gap, so to speak. I missed out earlier in life, so getting my fill now! And why the fuck shouldn't I? 

You're looking for marriage and as well you might. You do have a problem in that you're over 30 so you can't compete with these 20 somethings. I hate to use the word "alpha" but these alphas who have gaggles of 20-something chasing them have it pretty good! 

In contradiction to TRP, I find a lot more value in girls who have gone to the bother of educating themselves than some dullard who spent her life working in a factory with kids of various paternity looking for "Mr. Right". My two usual plates have far more depth to them and have actual developed personalities. And neither of them know who [insert latest teen sensation] is, neither of them are aware who [insert large-butted American chart singer in here] is fucking, or that [insert rap star here] just got shot or whatever mindnumbing bollocks is shoveled out by pop culture. 

To me, a girl without an education is fuck material and that's about it. Not because I'm predisposed to this thinking, but I just naturally find that they're too easily distracted by shiny things, have no focus and are frankly boring to spend any significant time with. So, in a complete anti-TRP sentiment, don't make light of your accomplishments. A Masters Degree isn't to be sniffed at. Unless of course it's a Masters in 17th Century Tapestry or some other waste of time. 

Also, I really am not a fan of the word “alpha”. When I go to the gym and see some of these guys who are well built, good looking, but who honestly just make derp noises for the sake of doing it, that to me is what an "alpha" looks like. And it really makes me think, "fuck sake, just shut up!". I'm there, getting changed, and they're obnoxiously "BUUP"-ing out some random notes, and seriously they're practically comparing dick sizes in some near-homoerotic game of "Let me see ur peen"! It's like they're five years old! Maybe I have the definition wrong, but if that's alpha, I'm happy to be just riding on the outskirts of alpha-town.

So why would an alpha give up casual sex with hotties to settle down, get married and have kids? Especially given the utterly raw deal that marriage brings? I'm hanging out with my cousin tonight. He got divorced three years ago. He's back home living with Mom and Dad because his paycheck goes to paying for his kids, the mortgage on the house where they live with his ex-wife that he is not allowed anywhere near and various other things. His ex-wife even moved in some guy that she was fucking most of the way through their marriage. So given that divorce rape is so very very real, why in fucks name would any man get married? When your only social outlet is reliant on friends and family members paying for you and not mentioning it (as in tonight), all because you got hammered in divorce court and have no means of even ever considering dating anyone else again in your life... this guy doesn't get to "start over". He's fucked. His life is this until the last kid turns 16 wherein he'll have just pushed over 50! That is the result of marriage for many men!

Hopefully that provides some perspective on how men think. Or at least, post-beta men like myself. I know this reads like I'm some frustrated angry little shit, but I'm actually not. The worst thing in my life was my ex in my LTR. Now she's gone, I live on my own, I'm my own boss, I do my own thing, I'm enjoying a new job role and life is fucking awesome. And the people that are around me are because they want to be. Not because I bought them or was the nice guy!

**Should you give up hope?** 

Hell no. You may have to rethink what Mr. Right looks like, sure. You’re looking to be the wifey. You may come one day to look upon a beta bucks. You know a lot of the alphas are chasing the 20 somethings. The betas are unaware that they could become a little more alpha. And being as you're looking for a husband, of course stability is a big part of that from a financial and a personable perspective. I mean, I doubt very much that top of your list is a minimum-wage 40 year old loser; I bet that if a 35 year old professional driving a brand new Audi wandered into your frame, he'd most certainly grab your attention! And why not, it's what you're looking for in a future hubby. After all, you've gone to the bother of educating yourself, you're in shape... these are not unnatural thought patterns! Shit, I'd say the same thing about myself. I think I have already!

One thing TRP teaches and is so painfully true is that any woman of any age can easily find a man to commit to her, regardless of who or what she is! If you don’t believe me, go hold vigil on a bench opposite a registry office one day!

So when I say you may need to realign what hubby looks like, it's most likely going to be a beta who you can softly prod into becoming a little more alpha. Just don't go too far, otherwise he may wake up!

But to pick out snippets from your post, namely:

> I'm still attractive and in shape

> if I should have made more of a concerted effort when I was younger?

>  rejected tons of good guys

From those statements, I guarantee you that there was at least one, if not more, guys who would have donated an arm and a leg to have been with you. An attractive 20 something in college... yeah who wants those! I can guarantee you that there MUST have been at least one guy. Unless you have a face like a truck or odd growths appearing from somewhere that scientists asked if they could study, there was someone! It's not even a question. There was!

**What you should do now?**

As you're posting anonymously on some internet forum (aren't we all), it's a nice easy way to get unhindered straight-to-the point advice. As a former long-term beta turned TRP, there's a few things you can do! 

First of all, get off these terrible subs. I like reading TRP. I go to the gym a lot, I make very good money, I have my interests and TRP showed me how to take control of these things and I have to say, my life has never been fuller. It's not just about fucking girls casually, I'm enjoying what I do. I have life plans and goals, stuff I never would have had if I was still in a betafied LTR. I'm glad of that. But, I can perfectly see the difference between wood and trees. 

Reading all these girl-power fuelled subs is all well and good provided you take only a handful of what they say! I promise, no guy wants to hear you bleat on about feminism, girl-power or all the other crap that infests the Internet these days. 

Go and have a read of Red Pill Woman. You obviously want to catch a good man, so really you need to know how to be a good woman! I don't bother girls about how much I can lift, nor do I attempt to tell them all about how I just got my hot lap down by 8/10ths of a second! Accede that you have flaws and want to fix them. It’s what TRP did for me.

Second, give us guys a break! I don't mean go out and fuck anything with a dick, but realize that not every nice guy is a creep with an overly impressive porn collection.

**tl/dr**
Go read Red Pill Woman and to use the hoary words thrown at every beta ever, just be nice!
