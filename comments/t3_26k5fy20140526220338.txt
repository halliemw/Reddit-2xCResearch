She is wrong, we don't want to go back to 70 hour work weeks.

I used to work for a non-profit in the medical education field in Canada, so not the US, but all the same problems.  It's true that women work less hours than men.  But IIRC women were above 35 hours on average.  So it's not like the women were slacking off, and the reduced hours are a good thing.  The norm used to be 70 hour weeks for the men in the middle of the 20th century, which is way to long for knowledge workers to be productive.  Particularly ones in a high stakes environment.  But both genders are reducing their hours to something more sane, so limiting women would only delay the problem.  Not only that but in Canada doctors can get paid per piece so it's not like the extra hours save money while practicing.  To top it off the med schools and research hospitals were increasing capacity to deal with the reduction in hours and have been for decades.  Although the schools have been adding capacity more reactively then using projections to guess at need.  As a result we've been playing catchup for decades.  For those citing tuition; there hasn't been any major free capacity in the education system.  So spots are the bottle neck not tuition.  Although tuition is affecting the amount of poor and middle class students going into med school.  The problem is no one wants to pay for the capacity in the education system unless the doctor shortage is in crisis mode.  Particularly when it takes an act of legislation to raise it. 

There are also other problems with finding doctors.  In Canada there is a huge shortage of rural doctors.
