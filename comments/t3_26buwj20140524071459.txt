My auntie is super healthy though and probably just wants me to be healthier. On my mums side of the family I only see my nan and auntie. My mum doesn't have any other siblings, my auntie has no kids and we don't see my mums cousins at all. 

The first guy ended up nearly sexually assaulting me and couldn't promise he wouldn't do the same again and sounded like a psycho when he said he doesn't know what he's doing sometimes. 

The most recent guy dumped me and one of the reasons he gave was because i'm curvy, not skinny. Having lost 2 stone and now being a healthy weight, I feel really crappy. He said he didn't have a type, but then it turned out that he likes skinny women. So pretty much dumped me to find someone skinnier and taller. But if i'm too big for him to find me sexy, why the hell did he sleep with me. It makes me feel used and as if he was just desperate. 

With my parents, what doesn't help is that I have a nephew who's a couple of years younger but is a lot smarter, has an offer for a much better university than I go to, has a job and has already passed his driving test and has a car.
