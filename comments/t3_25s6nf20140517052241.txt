I feel like I shouldn't waste this opportunity to say, "as a man".

Be direct. Tell him exactly what you're thinking. Look him in the eyes when you say it. Be confident. Reassure him that you really do want it, but you want to wait. Reassure him again that you really do want it. Reassure him one more time so he has no doubt whatsoever. Kiss a little bit more.

You are now gold. If he had a little bit of doubt whether he was interested in you before, it's now gone. 

I expect an invitation to the wedding; you can thank me there.
