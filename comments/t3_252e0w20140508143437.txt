I think what bothers me is that he makes the point of drawing on history, and therefore does not want to downplay the sexual violence, but doesn't address issues such as the fact that Jaime raping Cersei in the show was largely out of character, and treated with little to no amount of disdain by the narrative afterwards. I understand wanting to address the issue of sexual violence against women in history, but when is it enough?  He wants to draw attention (apparently) to the depraved nature of history, but how can that happen when no statement is being made other than, "it happened, it was awful?" It seems now that it's just there to be there, and isn't making any sort of grand statement about anything.
