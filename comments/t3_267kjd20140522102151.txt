My prescription also got changed about a year ago and I've gained about 15 pounds, have noticed a drop in sex drive, increased acne when I PMS, and way worse cramps. I'm hoping those problems will be fixed when I go off the pill. The pregnancy is also the biggest issue for me in doing this. My SO and I are both in school and not working ATM. But I know there are many other women who don't use hormonal BC and don't get pregnant. It just might take a bit more planning.
