Honestly? So many girls I knew got spray tans for prom. It didn't look awful but most of them were already a little tan to begin with. I'd suggest going with something that will LIGHTLY add color. I've heard Jergens tends to have self tanner in their products.

Find a bathing suit that compliments your skin and body and own it. Easier said than done, but also less maintenance! :P

As for just general body positivity...Your body is awesome and unique because it's yours. It can do so many things, including making both babies (if you want it to) and funny noises. Positive affirmations can work really well -- try looking in the mirror and complimenting yourself. It's awkward at first but it'll get easier with time.
