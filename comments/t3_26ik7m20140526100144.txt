Tights, leggings, yoga pants - they are not pants. They are worn as pants by girls who feel the need to show the curve of their butt for whatever reason. Of course, under the guise that they are "soooo comfy", as if that's the sole reason that they are worn....as pants. Come on, we think it's ridiculous when guys wear their pants halfway down their legs, right?

I think the perfect setting for tights/leggings is the night club, where you'll find the micro mini and figure hugging body con dress.


Of course, these are merely my opinions, and you won't find me boasting them anywhere other than under the anonymity of the internet.
