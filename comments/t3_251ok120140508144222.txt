You think this is just going to happen in the beginning? This is your life as a mod of TwoX now. When you are a default, the attention is all on you. All it is going to take it one post someone doesn't like to trigger a wave of trolls from 4chan or SRD or somewhere, since so many will now see it.

I have a very difficult time with you saying the mods cannot comment much because of the trolling. As a community we deserve a better response than the same cut and paste answer I've been seeing from one mod. It worries me that you guys as mods knew this was coming and you already can't handle both.
