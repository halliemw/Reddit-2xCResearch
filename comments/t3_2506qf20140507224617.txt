May I suggest that you meld the two topics, and teach both groups both things (in a gender-sensitive way, that is)? I work with a lot of teens, and several of the boys I see are just as nervous about how they look and that they're not built like an Abercrombie model as the girls with body issues. Lots of boys feel ugly and awkward in these new bodies too. 

I didn't think about this before, but you could also teach both genders about how skin works and relate it to hormonal acne and skin care. I had pretty bad acne as a tween/teen, and I certainly wasn't doing it any favors with the crazy ass combinations of products I was using. Most of the guys I know now who are 22+ are still clueless as to how face wash works or what to get when their skin is dry, and probably could use a little coaching. 

It sounds like you're an awesome teacher! I hope this goes well!!
