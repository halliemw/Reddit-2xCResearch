The problem is that some people, despite everything—despite years of history, despite well-publicized incidents of redditry, despite reddit having become a punchline across the internet for throwaway jokes about creeps and rapists—some people still somehow think of reddit as an open, welcoming community. Do you understand how insane this is? Nobody thinks this about Stormfront, for example.

The only way to help these people is to make sure that everyone, not just the savvier and more internet-aware, comes to know the truth about reddit and redditors. This site must become known to the public as Stormfront plus misogyny. Starve it of ad revenue; ensure no publicist would dream of sending their clients here for AMA’s. Leave reddit to redditors and redditors only. That’s why I upvote all the redditry, and you should too.
