>just because he has a penis you wouldn't want him around sometimes? 

Sometimes, yes. Like when she's not having a girl's night.

Same reason depression support groups are for people with depression. But I don't ONLY interact with depressives in the rest of my life.

For me, I know many men who fit that bill. Brothers, good friends, men with children, coworkers, all intelligent and supportive and empathetic. But they don't always want to hear about cracked nipples and birth control, or having to explain/defend feminism every so often when they want to play devil's advocate.

It's a bit of a gross generalisation, yes. Derived from my own experience with penis-havers. (There are also vagina-havers that I wouldn't want to invite along for girl's night for the same reasons though, fwiw.)

Bottom line, I want men in my life. Just not all the time.
