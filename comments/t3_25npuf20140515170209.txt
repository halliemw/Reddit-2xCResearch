Eh... one day I realized that I spend approximately zero time thinking about or looking at other people's armpit stubble, and that it was a bit silly to think anyone else was giving great thought to mine. Yeah, going out with a full armpit bush is still, unfortunately, a Big Deal, but I honestly don't think most people really care about what you've got going on. People are much too self-absorbed to really think about other people's armpits, you know?
