> Unfortunately, I had trusted all along that since he was a friend of a friend, there was no threat.

It sounds like he drugged you (you only mention having one drink, which you did not see prepared) and then took advantage of you. It's unclear (because you say there were periods of blur) whether or not he forced himself on you penetratively. I'm a pessimist, so I assume yes, but for your well-being, I'd cling to the fact that you kept saying no and he called you a tease and left. Because that *may* in fact be all that happened.

Whatever *actually* happened, this was sexual assault and at least attempted rape. And yeah, the 'friend's friend' motif is unfortunately very common. We are told, culturally, that if our friends have friends, then obviously, since we trust our friends, we should at least be polite and accommodating to their friends, as potentially trustworthy people. 

I am so sorry this happened to you. You're very brave for speaking about it at *all*.
