I've used the disposable Softcup. To insert it, you squeeze the sides together so instead of a circle, it's a long, narrow oval. Then push it in just like would a tampon without an applicator. It doesn't need to go far, just enough so it's not coming out and making you feel uncomfortable. You wear it for 12 hours, which is great since you really just need 1 or 2 a day, depending on if you want to wear one at night - I do pads at night. I have not experienced any leaking and do not wear a pad or panty liner when I'm using a cup. I've had no discomfort and actually find them to be much more comfortable than tampons.
Softcups do not have a string so you've got to insert a finger and hook onto the side of the Softcup in order to remove it. This can be a little tricky at first but just takes a few tries to get the hang of it.
