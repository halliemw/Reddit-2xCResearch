lol. "funky" vs "foul." I guess that's pretty subjective. I guess "pungent" would be the best way to describe it. I was worried that it might be something else because it's just discharge and no itching now. Is that kind of how yours is when you're getting better?

Have you ever tried taking monistat while taking the yeast infection pill?
