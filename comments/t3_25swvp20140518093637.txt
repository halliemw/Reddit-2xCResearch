This happens to both my wife and my daughter, and it makes me want to kill somebody.  Here's how I dealt with it with my kid:  jiu jitsu.  She's studied it hard, and now has a confidence she's never had before.  And it shows in her eyes.  Very, very few people try to pull that shit on her now because they can sense in her bearing that she'll open up a can of whoopass on them, so they mind their business.  

The beauty of jiu jitsu is there are a ton of "quiet" moves, like wrist locks and comealong holds that can be done with one hand, and will cause intense and immediate pain.  Somebody reaches for my kid and their wrist will be bent ferociously, right to the point of breaking, and generally the only sound is them screeching.  It's happened twice, and both times built her confidence even more.  

I highly suggest that any woman with this issue learn from a pro how to deal with it.  It's not your fault, and there is no reason whatsoever you shouldn't dress however you want to.  Just put yourself in a place where you can deal with the assholes of the world.  Good luck.
