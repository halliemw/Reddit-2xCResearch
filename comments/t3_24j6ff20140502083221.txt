It's great to see this from the female perspective. I'm about to get my MBA, and we are moving a second time for my husband who is in med school, and thoughts of how to balance having kids and careers are frequent (no kids yet though). I really relate to this post. 

I wonder if men feel the same as you did when a wife agrees to sacrifice her career for the family?
