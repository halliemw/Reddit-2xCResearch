I recently had surgery that makes the pill less effective and have tried both the nuvaring and patch, neither of which I was okay with. I can say don't try the patch, it leaves awful adhesive on your skin and looks terrible. My boyfriend didn't like it either. 
I have an appointment next week to discuss getting an IUD. I think it'll be the best option for me
