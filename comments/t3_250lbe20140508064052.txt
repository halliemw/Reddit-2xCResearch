It's always greener on the other side. Always.

I have exceptionally thick hair. There is so much hair on my head it's ridiculous. When it's long, it's fine. But when it's shorter, you are constantly combatting the "triangle" poof.  My hair can never look flat, I'll wake up in the morning and look like a mom from the 80s with this much volume.  So few people can get up and go and have flawless hair. 

Anytime I get my haircut it gets thinned to high heaven. She takes out so much hair and I'm amazed there is anything left, but there is. And it's a lot. Because it's so thick that means there is constantly hair growing, that means there are constantly wisps all over that never stay flat. It'll never be glossy and chic.  

But you're right, at the end of the day pretty much nobody cares.
