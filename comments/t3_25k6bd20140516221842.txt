This has been happening to me lately! My bank actually does call me Ms LastName, but it seems like every other company calls me Mrs LastName, which really irritates me. I'm not married and never have been, I'm 25 (and look like I'm 19 on a bad day) so I don't see how it could be a bad guess based on apparent age... I think I'd rather be called Miss than Mrs.
