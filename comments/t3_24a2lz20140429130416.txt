I am telling you that I have NEVER heard anyone mention anything about that on Mother's Day. People always say, "So what are you getting for your mom?" and I have to awkwardly say, "Well my mom died when I was a kid." 

This isn't souring things for mothers. Having lived through it, I think the amount of fervor around mother's day is ridiculous.
