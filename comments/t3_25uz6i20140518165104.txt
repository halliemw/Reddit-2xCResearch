I think there's a lot you learn about a person after you have sex with them. You can learn that they are the most considerate person in the world - or not. I'm going to assume you picked a good one. I learned exactly how much my SO cares for me after we started having sex. I was a virgin, he was not. He was incredibly gentle. It still amazes me that if I show any signs of distress, it doesn't matter if he is on the verge of orgasm - he stops immediately and we adjust for our mutual comfort. He also made sure we had water and snacks nearby for our first marathon sessions, something I hadn't considered.
