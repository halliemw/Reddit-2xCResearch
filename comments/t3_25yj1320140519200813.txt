I had mine removed by my nurse practitioner. I loved it and it worked well for me, but we are ready for baby #2. I was really nervous. And I'm not going to lie... It was VERY painful. I'd advise taking some pain meds before the procedure. 
Edit to say I just got it out about two weeks ago, so the pain is fresh in my mind. I had a lot of cramps after as well. I'm glad to read not everyone had a similar experience!
