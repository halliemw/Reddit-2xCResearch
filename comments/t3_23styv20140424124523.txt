Bodies such as OSHA definitely provide regulations and guidelines for ensuring a safe work environment, but since 'prize at a golf tournament' is such a rare and unusual occupation, I'm not sure whether they would have any guidelines that would cover it, or whether they were violated in this case if so.  I don't think the article gives enough details to meaningfully discuss the actual case in question, although the hypotheticals may be interesting.
