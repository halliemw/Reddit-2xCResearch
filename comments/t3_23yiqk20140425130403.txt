He could really like you but not be attracted to you. This sounds like an experience from a girlfriend and it turned out that the guy was gay. He didn't even realize it himself until a few years later - so I wouldn't go to this guy and accuse him. Of course, he could just really like you as a friend. I have several male friends that I really like and will make time to see but I'm not attracted to them at all.
