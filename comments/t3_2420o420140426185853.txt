Seconded for Buffy. Started watching it for silly background noise while I did homework, three months later I couldn't wait until I had a chance to watch the next episode. Not very scary, campy at times but not in a bad way, very funny, and a lot of emotional depth. Only show I've liked more than Gilmore Girls!
