I'm 31 and I had sinuplasty about a year ago to correct a deviated septum.  I am arabic, but did not have a huge nose.  I actually liked my nose but did have feelings about it being too big, too long, etc when I was your age.  After the surgury, I moved to another country, and began to notice my nose in the mirror.  Turns out the sinuplasty changed the shape of my nose for the worse and cause asymmetry in my nose.  From either side it looks different.  I am really kind of pissed off about this because I have never obsessed about my nose and now can't stop focusing on how it has changed my face.  When I get back to the US I plan to have it fixed but now its going to cost the full price because I've already used the sinuplasty excuse (I had to pay my huge deductible so its not like that was free either).  If I were you, I'd wait until you are about 30 to decide.  You are probably much cuter than you think, I look at pictures of myself from before and wish I had realized it!  You still have time to grow into it, and it can't be undone.  I wish I didn't correct my septum, not worth the easier breathing haha.
