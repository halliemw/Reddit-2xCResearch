> Saying "hey, be quiet for a little while so we can have a conversation" is nothing like "no, you are never allowed to talk, ever."

So because feminists feed on this idea that women are constantly and everywhere oppressed, they think its ok to inflict that same kind of oppression on others?  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Saying "you can't talk" is oppressive.  Period.  Most people don't accept the social justice warrior reasoning that "women have been oppressed therefore they can do whatever the fuck they want to men because fuck you shitlords."  

2 wrongs don't make a right and if you think you do then you are just going to cause more strife and hatred.  

If anything, this is more evidence that this sub should never have gone default.  if you want to have a "safe space" for women (i.e., a hostile space for men), then you should keep it secret and not tell anybody about it because when people find out the extreme hypocrisy that goes on here they will object.
