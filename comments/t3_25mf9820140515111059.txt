I got my ears pierced when I was twelve but had some keloid scarring issues and by the time I was 16 I couldn't wear earrings anymore. in my late 20s now and I don't miss my piercings at all! Quite honestly it was kind of a hassle to me to keep them clean, not lose the backs etc. My husband complains sometimes that it would be easier to buy me gifts if he could just buy me earrings. There are plenty of ways to feel feminine without poking holes in your face!
