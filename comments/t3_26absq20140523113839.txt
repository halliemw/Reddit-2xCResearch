I agree with this as a point. My mom said long ago she was afraid that I would be the pleaser in a relationship just because she knows me. I was not worried about it at the time but our relationship is different now (and I am older). Its hard seeing things from the inside the relationship but I do know that this is probably what has happened just because I am that kind of person naturally. Sounds like we need to have a conversation about a few things.
