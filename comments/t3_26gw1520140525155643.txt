You could check /r/ABraThatFits for swimsuit suggestions if you're looking for something with more support. I think Nordstroms sells bikinis in bra sizes with underwear - they're also having a sale on right now.

I also get freaked out by unexpected dangling swimsuit ties. I've sewn straps together at the appropriate length before to avoid that.
