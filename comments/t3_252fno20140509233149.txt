[The Ad Hominem Fallacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GzXVqwYHVE&feature=youtu.be&t=59s), from 0:59 to 2:48 (to include the Hitler and Mother Teresa examples).

Etymologically "ad hominem" is "to the man" (as against "to the argument"). Unlike when most ad hominem arguments are deployed "mansplaining" (when not being used in the sense at its coinage) is literally "to the man".

Edit: And an Ad Hominem fallacy is always a fallacy. It is always a fallacy to think a persons argument's invalid in virtue of their characteristics. However, it may well be misapplied. For example, if someone hurls personal insults at, or derides the character of an author, instead of addressing the author's argument, that is not an Ad Hominem fallacy (and this is where taking the etymology as entailing the meaning would be a problem).
