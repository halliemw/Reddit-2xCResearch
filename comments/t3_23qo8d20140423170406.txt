Oh hun I know I know, way easier said than done.  I was always a little sensitive as a guy about my looks and such, and now I completely switch genders and it might feel good but makes me all that more sensitive about stuff!  Especially when transgenders in general are still the least accepted group, so really good nice ppl can even end up rejecting you...
