Try [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) to find a group to work out with, one that meets in the park. Or some other form of group that meets to do something free. 

ETA: If you're also having problems convincing your BF that you don't need him to be there with you all the time, start going out and doing things and letting him know you've got appointments (not like doctor appointments or anything, but I can't think of the English word for it). See if there are any museums in close enough proximity that are free to visit. Take a book and a sammich and head to the park for a few hours. Use Google maps to plan a walking route to parts of the city you've never seen before (wifey and I did that a few weekends back and came  across a park near a river we never knew existed about 3 km away from our house).
