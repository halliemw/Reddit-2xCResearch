I really appreciate you taking the time to both open up and to point out the ways that this movie portrays teenage girls. I have been stuck watching Disney channel all weekend with my boyfriends daughter. All of those teenage girls are cookie cutter, beautiful, sometimes ditzy, and always obsessed with boys. These are not the type of girls that I want leaving an impression on my SOs daughter. 

I showed her the movie divergent as soon as I could. She already loved the hunger games bc of the strong female lead, and I want to continue to perpetuate this image of teenage girls over the Disney princesses.

Divergent was inspiring in a number of ways, perhaps mostly because the buzz it's generated has to produce more movies with similar messages. It's so difficult to grow up under the scrutiny our girls go through and I will do anything I can do to show her that she can prove people wrong, she is strong, and she deserves to be treated equally.
