just cos people shouldn't doesn't mean they don't. that's never really been a practical request - downvoting is often used instead of a dozen people posting 'I disagree but I don't have time/energy/the information to hand to engage myself in an argument'. That doesn't always mean it's an 'emotional reaction' remember - a person can have completely rational, logical, fact-based reasons for not liking something and just downvoting it instead of actually explaining why that is.
