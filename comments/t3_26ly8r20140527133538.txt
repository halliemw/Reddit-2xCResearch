> It was unreal how adamant the officer was about how I should have just ended this guy's life.

Part of that is the officer's training. I am not LE but do (legally) carry a gun for personal protection, and have taken a number of courses on defensive tactics. I wholeheartedly hope I never have to shoot my gun at someone, but if someone attacks me and means business, I'm shooting until that person stops moving towards me. A dead would-be rapist or killer can't stand in front of a jury and claim that he meant no harm and I attacked him. I have zero desire to ever take a life but it's my feeling that a person gives up his or her right to live when they decide to try to take mine.

I am really happy to hear that you were able to get away and that the PD is taking your attack seriously.
