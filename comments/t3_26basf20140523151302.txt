Congratulations!  Quitting an addiction is hard--I'm really glad to hear you're almost through.  I lost one of my best friends to a heroin addiction for five years while I was in college, and last year he finally got clean and started coming back around.  It was great while it lasted.

And congrats, also, on the arrival of your hormones!  A good friend of mine is a transwoman and she said things really started to change for her when she got on HRT.  (Although she doesn't plan to transition her bottom.)
