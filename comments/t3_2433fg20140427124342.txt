I worked at a store that sold everything to make your own wine and beer. We also sold purified water by the gallons. The wine and water especially got pretty heavy, pretty quick. Nothing heavier than 40-50 lbs. 

I was told constantly by my customers that I should not be working there, doing all that "heavy lifting". Once a husband and wife come in, and they buy something relatively small (considering the other products we sell) and the husband gets upset when his wife picks it up and tried to snatch it from her hands. She responds with "give it up, I've carried children far heavier than this a lot further than to our parking space."
