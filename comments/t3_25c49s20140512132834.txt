You need a nightly foot care ritual.  Soak your feet in warm-hot water with Epsom salt.  Use the pumice during the soak.  After you dry your feet off, put petroleum jelly on them, and put thin socks on.  Do this every night and you'll see a difference.  The graters might cause more damage to your feet, since you're already able to peel chunks off.
