During my last break-up, I actually found that (500) Days of Summer was a really good cathartic movie with a bit of hope at the end.  I thought it was pretty silly the first time I saw it, but the second time I guess I was in a place where I could really empathize with JGL's character.  There's this one line where someone says, "Just because she likes the same stupid crap  that you do doesn't mean she's your soul mate,"  and that actually was really enlightening for me.  I thought that because we liked the same things that most other people didn't like we were meant for each other, but actually that is not the case!  Woa!  You can like the same stupid shit and still be incompatible, and if he wasn't my soul mate then there is someone better for me out there!  If this is speaking to you then I definitely recommend it.  I'm having trouble of thinking of other happy cry movies, but if one comes to me I'll come back and edit it in.  I hope you feel better soon, I'm thinking of you!
