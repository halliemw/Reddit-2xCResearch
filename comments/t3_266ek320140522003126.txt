So your best friend dated a guy who spread rumors about their sexual activity and acted like an all around jerk, and you're upset because she doesn't want him at your joint grad party.  So let me ask you a question.  Who's more important to you: you best friend? or some jerk that your best friend used to date?  Come on dude, act like a friend and uninvite the guy to the party.
