>Personally, I can't even feel the ring, but I can always feel even the smallest tampons, which is why I use pads for my periods.

This makes me somewhat hopeful. If the pill that I'm on ends up being like the others, maybe the ring will work for me. My doctor said that lots of women who reacted badly to pills had great success with the ring.

>I hope you can find something that works better for you.

Thank you, I really appreciate that. I hope so too. ):
