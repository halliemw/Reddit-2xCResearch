Well, when I start with the image of a decent-but-ignorant guy in my head, and run through the scenario, I get an image of a confused person incensed that OP would accuse him of lying when he deletes the image, and furthermore demands she see his phone?

Perhaps I'm guilty of projecting, since I know how private I am about my phone. And equally guilty of wanting to give people the benefit of the doubt.

I mean, would I say it's more likely that he's private than lying? No. I wouldn't even give them equal odds. I'm just saying that that other possibility exists; OP should not go to this conversation having already convinced herself that he's definitely a douchebag and a liar (or, in fact, that he's ignorant and private). Deciding now cuts off options.
