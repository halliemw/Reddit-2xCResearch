You can accept responsibility or accept obesity.  

A lot of people like to tell you flattering things, but those people aren't looking out for you.  They think they are, but they aren't.

They want life to be easy, but it's not.  Listening to them will only lead to heartbreak and unrealistic expectations from the work you put in.

Read up and find out what you need to do, and then do it.  

Recommit every Monday to your goal and don't accept excuses from yourself.  You'll get there, and everyone (your dad included) is rooting for you.

Good luck.
