It sounds like you're having a girl crush, except he's a boy, which makes that pretty confusing.
I'm a 25yo girl, and had a huge girl-crush on a co-worker, and I worked out eventually that I was misreading what I thought was sexual attraction to be more an attraction for who she was. I just loved being around her, there were so many qualities of hers I wanted to adopt. 

But then in your case he's a gay man, so I could be completely wrong :)
