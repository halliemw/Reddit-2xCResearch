Actually, that's not it at all. 

Mens rights are a serious issue. As I said before, it is the same social forces at work that cause either gender to be treated unfairly because of their gender. And as I'm sure you *do* understand - it's wrong. I'm *not* against men's rights, I am vehemently for them, and *if* that what MRA actually were for I would fully support them. 

Except... there is strong evidence for quite the contrary. You clearly aren't very familiar with it because otherwise you would have known exactly what I meant with the "fighting against advocates for sexual assault victims." A while ago, there was a whole bunch of hoopla where MRAs actively worked to dismantle methods of reporting rape, and verbally attacked a woman who gave seminars about the attitudes surrounding rape (notably, that it's the victims fault and, you know, *not* the rapist's). This is, by the way, completely ignoring the fact that men are victims of sexual assault as well, and often face social stigma against reporting it and/or getting help, and are subject to 'victim-blaming' just the same (because men "are supposed to be strong enough to defend themselves" and supposed to "always like sex with women so they can't be sexually assualted by one" and also homophobia and claims that they "must be gay" and so on and so forth). For a much better summary of this ridiculous chain of actions taken by "mens right's activists" [please read this](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/01/02/mens-rights-activists-call-for-rape-accuse-a-thon-to-smear-sex-assault-victims-advocate/). In short, these actions show that MRA aren't really helping men, just attacking feminists. And going about it in a way that, well... makes it even harder for me to take them seriously.

As one writer so eloquently sums up her (and also, my own) opinion of the MRA group: ["this is not a legitimate political or social movement; it is a hate group."](http://jezebel.com/no-i-will-not-take-the-mens-rights-movement-seriously-1532799085) 

Finally, please see [the part of this article titled "A List of "Men's Rights" Issues That Feminism Is Already Working On"](http://jezebel.com/5992479/if-i-admit-that-hating-men-is-a-thing-will-you-stop-turning-it-into-a-self-fulfilling-prophecy). It's a very nice summary of how feminism does support men's rights. Because, as I said before and will say again, it's the same forces at work that hurt both. Feminists realize this (now, some will argue that women have historically had it harder, and still do, but that doesn't mean they are illegitimate claims. Sexism hurts everyone, men or women and all those "in between.")
