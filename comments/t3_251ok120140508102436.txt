Right? I haven't seen ONE mod post or reply to a comment other than the sticky at the top of the sub. I get the feeling this was a safe place for a lot of women dealing with sensitive issues, who post during difficult time in their lives. Now, I feel that these women don't have the same sense of security, and have the possibility of being bombarded with idiotic comments that could prove to be especially hurtful.
