I guess I'm worrying about mixing professional and personal life. It's hard letting people in as true friends, people I could rely on listening to both the good and bad, and I haven't had enough good experiences to feel comfortable with experimenting. I think I'll allow myself to enjoy the crazier things in life and face the consequences. I'm not perfectly sure what will happen, but it's better to do it and find out than regress and regret.
