Im sorry to tell you this because I can see that you're posting because you're hoping that you can do something to address/help/fix her. You can't. It's in the nature of personality disorders. There is no medication and the therapies don't really work. This is who she is and you will be marrying this woman, BPD and all. The best thing you can do is accept that you're signing up to a lifetimes worth of this behaviour and find a way to help *yourself* cope with it.
