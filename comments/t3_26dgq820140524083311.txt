Thank you for posting that!

That was a great read and I can relate to so much of what she went through, from being induced at 2 weeks past my due date and being forced to wither in pain for 29 hours to  how I felt about breast feeding in public. Prior to becoming a mother I had all these great expectations about how things were 'supposed' to happen but as the author states sometimes your feelings change or somethings doesn't go as planned.
