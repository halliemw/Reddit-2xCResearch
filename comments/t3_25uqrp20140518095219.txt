Thank you so much... I had someone straight up harassing me on here. I felt a little defensless over it but realized they were some lonely troll. I can't believe how shitty people who claim to love you can be. Both men and women... it's nuts! 
Anywho, i'm really going to kick my moms butt in gear to get her a better job. She works for a child care now making hardly $250/2weeks and I work at General Motors making alright money but I'm going to look for another job ontop of this one because there's no way we will be able to live on a combined income of what her and I make now. 


I'll just look at it as a new adventure for her and I that kind of sucks but will turn out okay in the end.
