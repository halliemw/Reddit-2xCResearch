I would also consider getting some kind of alarm system. I'm fairly poor so I ended up getting Simplisafe (http://simplisafe.com/). You install it yourself and it's only $15/month after buying the initial sensors. Even just finding some "Protected by ____ Security" stickers actually deters intruders!
