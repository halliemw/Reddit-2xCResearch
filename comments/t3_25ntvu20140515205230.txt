There are times when I have to step away. I just *can't* and recognizing that I can't is an important part of self-care. I go read or watch a movie and always work on some project or another that just makes me feel better. 

Or I rant my face off, sometimes literally yelling at the screen, sometimes while I do other things or sometimes with my SO. It doesn't solve anything, but it certainly makes me feel at least somewhat better.
