This has never happened to me, and that behavior is not acceptable nor is it funny. I'm really sorry you had to deal with it.

Your body is off-limits without your express say so, especially in a professional work environment. Touching, attempting to touch, making comments about your status (pregnant or not), is both very rude and sexual harassment. 

Even if you were pregnant, and announcing it, they would still have zero recourse to touch you without your permission. I don't understand why people have a problem respecting pregnant women's bodily autonomy. 

I like to think that most people respect the social norm of you don't ask someone if they're pregnant, ever. It's rude, and if you are right/wrong in any number of contexts you can be causing considerable pain to another person.
