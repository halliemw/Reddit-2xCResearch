i don't know if you realize this. but just in case you were unaware. if you give a woman an orgasm you end up triggering a cascade of hormones. amongst that cascade is a strange interaction between the hormones "vasopressin" (aka ADHD) and "oxytocin", these two hormones mediate the feelings of romantic love and pair bonding. the stronger a woman's orgasms the more she will fall in love with you, it is a chemical pathway that she has no control over. (due to the short duration of male orgasm, this pathway does not make men fall in love, although they do experience mild bonding over it). 

so for your own good, you may not want to make a woman orgasm too much if you are some type of sex god. this will cause them to fall in love with you.
