I would post this to /r/christianity.  They can give you a different perspective and that is what you need right now.

I'm not in any way saying you should become Christian, however, this sub (and the vast majority of reddit) is heavily atheist and I would hate for you to throw away this beautiful relationship you have with the man you love because of reading all these people saying it's not going to work. 

I wish I had some better advice of my own, but I do urge you to post there. It's a wonderful community and they give GREAT advice, whether or not you believe in God.

Edit: I just think it's hard for non-religious people to truly understand the situation from your boyfriend's perspective. I wish you luck.
