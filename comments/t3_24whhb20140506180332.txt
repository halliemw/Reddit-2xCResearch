Giving birth because you are being bullied into it is NOT OK. You agreed together that you would abort. Now he is backing out and not being the partner he said he was going to be. It doesn't matter how much money you make- having children is not just a financial issue.  Clearly if that was the only issue you would be already having children. It is your body and your future and if he is going to pull this shit over bringing an innocent life into this world I can't imagine what will happen once the kids are already in place.
