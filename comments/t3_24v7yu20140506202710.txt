Recently I helped a friend get out of an abusive relationship. I recognized the signs about a year ago and he didn't become violent until several months afterwards. I told her I was worried about her and that I was there for her and gave her some links to resources. She didn't want to hear it and dismissed what I had to say. She distanced herself from me, and I didn't push the issue. It wasn't until about a month ago that she came to me asking for help getting out and I willingly obliged. It's already been said but you can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved. It's ultimately her decision and you can't make it for her or force it on her. All you can do is wait for her to come to the realization on her own. It totally sucks to just sit and do nothing, but sometimes that's all you can do.
