I don't think it necessarily has to say anything about those who can't or won't fight back. It disturbs me to see that reaction in a lot of the discussion, the assumption that a positive statement about something equals a condemnation of something else.

Telling you I like your comment doesn't mean I dislike or think all other possible comments that aren't this are bad!
