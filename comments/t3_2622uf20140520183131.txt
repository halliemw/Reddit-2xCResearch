I want to just start out by saying I think it's wonderful that you're talking about this things. I think it's very optimistic and loving to find a middle ground. That being said, there are going to be a lot of points like this where what you want and what he wants are going to be at odds. I say this, as being in the exact opposite situation as you. I think it is wonderful that we live in a society that allows women to choose what they believe to be best. For me, I could never get an abortion, call it pride, call it responsibility, hell, call it me being brainwashed. It's just not something I feel comfortable with (you could even call it catholic guilt from the way i was raised). My SO would MUCH RATHER me choose abortion over adoption or even keeping the child. I've made it very clear that at this point in my life, I would keep a baby if I get pregnant. I'm 25, I have a job that pays well enough and a family that could support me emotionally, so things are different. My whole point of this is just be sure that you OWN your decisions, because at some point, you'll waver and it could turn into resentment. Thank you for being responsible adults.
