The education and training of a lot of Muslim scholars is *very* faulty. Also, the *carrying out* of these punishments is absolutely contrary to Sharia law. For example, to actually punish someone for adultery you have to have *four* witnesses not to mention a bunch of other requirements that are basically impossible to meet in order to even execute punishment, which is hardly ever supposed to be *death*. The "punishments" are to illustrate how bad the sin is, not to actually be used. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc. that actually mete out "Sharia law" are, quite ironically, doing so in a way that's very un-Islamic. You don't get to pass judgment if you're not an educated Muslim or if you haven't even picked up a good translation of the Qur'an.
