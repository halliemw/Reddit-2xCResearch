>This is exactly the same for MRAs, most are normal guys concerned for men and boys rights, and *feminists* cherry pick the crap from the community

Whoops, you just showed your bias. You just said that an enormous movement whose main goal is equal rights for women cherry-picks to damage men's rights.

I actually agree with the first part of your statement, and I'm a feminist. In this case, I'm not cherry-picking to find your bias, as it's half of your comment.
