I'm actually unconvinced by this argument. 

One of the great thing about social progress is that feminism is part of mainstream public discourse these days. I've been following feminism for about 20 years and the inclusion of feminist voices in mainstream media, particularly in the last five years or so, has grown incredibly.

Not a day goes by when I don't see a feminist opinion piece or feminist issue raised in national or regional newspapers or on evening television news. These voices are loud and present. I struggle to see how prominent feminists who appear almost daily in the media are somehow less loud than anonymous Tumblrinas or commenters in /r/feminism (which isn't anywhere near as radical as most Redditors would have everyone believe).

Rarely does anyone on Reddit actually name a feminist, they just point to Tumblr or SRS. No one knows the name of "Big Red" and they point to one protest of a Warren Ferrell event which, if they watched the video of the event itself, would hear Warren Ferrell state he's only ever been protested against once before in his professional career.

Feminism has always had this myth surrounding it about being anti-men, anti-feminine, anti-sex, humourless and angry. I used to think those things too before actually reading feminists texts, and realised that it's incongruent with the vast majority of the movement. [I think this piece in the Good Men Project](http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-women-arent-crazy/) actually does a great job of explaining a reason why these myths might persist.
