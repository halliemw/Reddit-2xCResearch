If he was so driven by his need to kill women, the lack of answer wouldn't have stopped him. There were obviously women in there. Show me a completely empty sorority house. There is always someone around.  If he was just on a singular mission to kill women, he would've done just that. He would've kept his main kills to his original plan of "finding the hottest sorority house" or whatever it was and killing them all. His male victims outnumbered the female victims. If I recall the only female victims were the three women (two of whom died) who happened to be in front of the sorority house. The rest were male. The beginning of his kills were all men stabbed to death. Did his negative view of women help shape his mindset that drove him to this? Maybe, probably definitely. Was that his main drive? No way. He hated the males getting laid almost as much as the women who rejected him because they got what he wanted, and he found them undeserving. I repeat. Mental illness is and should be the focus here, as it was the main drive. I agree misogyny is prevalent and needs addressing, but this is not the time.
