I feel a little awkward writing this, but I thought you should know:

I did downvote you. Not because you're a guy, but because:

(a) You prefaced your statement with a weird, unnecessary apology.

(b) Your comment is chock-full of grammar and spelling mistakes (I count over 18 errors in <6 lines).

I do think your points are good, but I don't enjoy reading comments like this.
