Thanks! I'll give it a look. I'm 160 lb so kinda close but I'll ask her about her opinion on it. And for some reason anything other than the pill seems too new for me to be comfortable with. I don't know really, just a mental block about it. I even have one about birth control pills but mom recently told me that she was on the pill before having us (4 kids, easy pregnancies--exactly what I want in life) so that helped me feel better about it.
