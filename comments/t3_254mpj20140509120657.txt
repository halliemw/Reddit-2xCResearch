I can relate! I had a hysterectomy a couple weeks ago, and of course, the day of the surgery, it was my heavy period day. As in heavy period, we are talking about 1.5 oz per hour spewing forth, and also of course, no diva cup or tampon was allowed. 

I told the intake nurse I was menstruating, and she whipped out some disposable "underwear," and a big FAT pad from the 1970s. My thin pad was more efficient, but whatevs.  Then I sat around bleeding in pre-op for 2 hours. They wouldn't let me get up to use the bathroom to change out the pad, I just had to bleed all over the bedding, making a mess. After much pestering, a nurse finally obliged me by changing the pad HERSELF. Just as you said, she wasn't happy about it, but accepted it as an unpleasant part of her day she'd just have to deal with, whipping off the old and throwing the new one on. Of course, they wheeled me around, bloody sheets and everything.

I was just telling myself, "It will all be over in a few hours, you'll never have to worry about this again. Just get through this next couple hours!"

But I still cringe when I think about it.
