These are some great ideas, thank you! 

I'll be sure to ask her about the bike - I wouldn't be surprised if they had some lying around already. 

I meant to say in the OP that I'm thousands of miles away, or I would be teaching her to drive. It's hard for me to even imagine not being able to drive or having someone able to teach you. 

Nannying does sound like the best idea in terms of skills she has. Maybe she could even become a live-in nanny later on. 

I've mentioned getting out/getting exercise to her, having been depressed myself I know how hard it can be to get going. The weather where she lives is usually rainy and cool, which makes her want to stay in. I know she does sometimes get her siblings from the bus stop, but it's far from regular. And I'll be sure to ask her about the water :)
