I have a lot of built up resentment about this kind of stuff happening to me when I was this age. Although at that time social media wasn't nearly as big.

  I know if I could go back, or of I was in your sisters situation What I would say now would be, for example, if a guy hit me: 'WTF is wrong with you? You think that makes you cool, you think your a fucking tough guy cos you hit a *girl* for no reason?!". or tell the girls bothering her. 
"yeah, you think your cool when you bully someone who's done *nothing* to you? you're so messed up"

Honestly I have no idea if that would help. But I believe you need to note two things when dealing with this. 

1. All kids think they are, or should act older than they are. 
  They do not see how messed up it is to say, call a 13 year old a girl a slut for wearing shorts. No one has any concept of how young they are, because they are always the oldest they have ever been. 
2. Most bullys have little understanding of the fact they are bullying.
  They think they are vigilantes. they think they are defending themselves, they think they are scaring others away from mistreating them. They might think your sister is deliberately making them look bad. they might legitimately think they have to 'put people in their place' if they deem them to dress 'inappropriately'. Most bullys think they are part of some bizarre natural order, and when something bothers them they have to intervene.  
   This is why I'd recommend to her really spelling it out how messed up what these people are doing is. "What did I ever do to you?!" A lot of people try to respond to bullys with other insults, but I really feel this helps the bully to justify their own behaviour, make them see it as more of an even fight. She needs to block them on social media. and stay far away out of their path.
