I'm so sorry this happened to you and I hope that you find closure. I know for myself at least vocalising and writing stuff down does lift a part of the weight off my shoulders so I hope that writing this did the same for you. Hearing stories like this really piss me right off, I've zero tolerance for this kind of behaviour. I would have kicked the shite out of this guy for you had I been there!
