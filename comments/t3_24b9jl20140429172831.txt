Yes, they are combo pills.

My most recent pill is basically making me feel pregnant and the only time it stops is when I let myself have a period. I'm on one of the continous pills right now. I'm just so fed up with all of it. Everyone says that the longer you are on a pill the less it should effect you/ you become used to it but the longer I'm on them the worse they get! 

Was that your experience?  How did you find out you are estrogen intolerant? Did you have different side effects with different pills? 

Sorry for the 20 questions, I'm just so sick and tired (ha... literally) and I want all the info I can get before going to see my gyno.
