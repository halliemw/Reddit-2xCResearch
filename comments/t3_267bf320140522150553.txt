It is a problem for the same reason gendering of other words is a problem. Many people in the feminist movement believe that gendering of job titles is a part of patriarchy that is designed keep girls from aspiring to be in certain positions. The theory is that words like Congress*man*, alder*man*, police*man* and council*man* make those professions of power less available and attainable in the minds of young girls who may want to be those things. The truth behind the words is that the "-man" ending on words in English only means "-person" and does not actually have a male or female connotation, just like in our word "mankind." This could be seen as an example of what you call **"whiners can't be bothered to do a quick google search to find out the actually definition"**.

If we know that gendering words has the power to cause harm, then why is the evil force that is designed to oppress half of the world's population named after men? (patriarchy) And why is the positive, benevolent force that fights to free those oppressed named after only women? (feminism). This implicates all men in the oppression and turns any woman into an admirable freedom fighter. 

The civil rights movement in the 50's and 60's in the United States did not name themselves "Blackists" as if they wanted to take a white America and turn it black for themselves. They called it "human/civil rights" so as to take an America that was already both black AND white and make it more fair for everyone. Just so, we should call feminism something that does not sound like taking an "evil male patriarchy" and feminizing it, but something that takes the diverse world we already have and makes it fair for everyone.

This is my first post on /r/TwoXChromosomes, and I hope I have not offended anyone.
