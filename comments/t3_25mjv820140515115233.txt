Put a mirror under your boobs, lean over a bit, look down, and see how your partner sees your boobs when you're on top. 

You'd be surprised. It's a really flattering angle.

You've probably only seen you boobs from one angle looking in the mirror. Perspective and angles have a huge impact on the way we see ourselves but they don't tell the whole story. [Check out this photography project NSFW](http://www.nerve.com/love-sex/the-real-nude-vs-the-posed-nude-nsfw)

Basically, you're way hotter than you think you are. 

Remember, if you think you look sexier with a bra on, don't be afraid to wear a bra. There's nothing wrong with it.
