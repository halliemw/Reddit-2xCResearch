> asking me if I'd ever thought about what it'd be like to be with 8 arab men while his friends laughed 

"I don't know, how was it for your sisters/moms in Saudi Arabia? Did they also enjoy being with 8 Arab men?"

They'll probably get pissed, but then I make them realize just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I deserve your shit. I'm someone's daughter/sister too and the same way you wouldn't allow other men to speak to your relative that way you should stop too.
