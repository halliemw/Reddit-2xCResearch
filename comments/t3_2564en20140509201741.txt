I got a lunette cup. There were a lot of reasons why I'd wanted to try one for a while, but I think the thing that really pushed things over the edge for me is that THEY CAME IN COLORS AND I HAD CHOICES!

They're also, I hear, a little bit softer than Diva cups. Mine works amazingly, though. Like wearing it for the first time, it literally sealed well enough that it felt like I wasn't even having a period. And it was really interesting to just see my period blood in that form, and get to poke around with it on the bathtub floor and see how it responded. Maybe I'm gross. Also I deal with materials science and I have a lasting desire to perform rheology on it. >.>

It was a bit tricky to get in/out at first, and I would recommend doing so in a shower when you start, but it gets easier with time. Feel free to ask if you have further questions. (:
