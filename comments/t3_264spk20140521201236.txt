I just want to personally thank you for being an amazing parent. I recently told my mom I thought I had depression and she rolled her eyes and told me I didn't.
I've also questioned myself lately if I'm straight or bisexual and I can honestly say that I'll NEVER tell my mother. So thank you, I'm so glad people like you exist.
