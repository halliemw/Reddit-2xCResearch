Online dating. I know it's lame and I don't take it incredibly seriously, but it's nice to know there are other men out there who are also attractive, smart, and funny. It helps me keep perspective. It also doesn't hurt that once in a blue moon, you'll meet someone engaging and interesting. Good luck. I am struggling with a very similar scenario only it's a living situation. It takes some compartmentalizing to handle, but it can be done. I hope you feel better soon!
