Lupron worked for me (having a break while we go for some IVF) I haven't found anything else that has really worked for me at all in regards to the non hormonal route...
I try to stick to a paleo diet and keep as fit and healthy as I can, however I haven't noticed it make any real difference. Every month I am begging to have a hysterectomy. ha.

Hope you find something.
