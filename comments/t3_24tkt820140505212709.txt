Wow, thank you for this! In addition to identifying a lot with your overall situation, I actually sound more like your boyfriend in this scenario in that I leave all the decisions up to my SO, so it is incredibly helpful to hear the other side of things!  I think that being more upfront about it would definitely be best, even though the idea of a schedule makes me a little antsy (not even sure why). I could really see him getting into that, and trying to make it into a challenge to see who can propose the weirdest/best date.

I think my deal in general is that I have a hard time knowing what to bring up and what to try to sort out by myself, due to some crummy past boyfriends who absolutely hated communication.  Having people share their stories with me and give me (really helpful!) tips makes things feel clearer. Thank you!
