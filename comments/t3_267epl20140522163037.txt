That's great for you, but what if your partner has expressed he doesn't want a child, yet you still continue to have sexual relations with him?  Doesn't that make you if not totally, at least partially responsible for that child?  You can argue that MAYBE he owes your medical expenses up until the birth(but I think in this day and age he should be able to opt out of that too), but why should he pay for a child he doesn't want and doesn't want to have to see?  Really, our legal system forces him to support YOUR child for you.
