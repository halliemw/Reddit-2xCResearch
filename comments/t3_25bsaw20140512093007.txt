There are a lot of things people with depression feel. You are right that some people feel complete anhedonia. Some people don't feel anything at all, some people are frustrated and some people have rage. Some people feel a mixture of things. Depression means different things to those that have been diagnosed with it and need to be diagnosed with it. The word depression doesn't accurately describe the disorder. 

Some people who are diagnosed with depression do experience profound sadness, I am one of them.  The word sadness is a mild one though, most people that aren't depressed think it means bummed out. But really, I can't think of a word in English that really describes how disconnected, hopeless, painful and terrifying "sadness" is to me. I don't think a vocabulary has been created to really describe depression.
