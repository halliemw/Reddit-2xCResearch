It's not a big deal. They're things you can get with or without sex and are easily curable . Go to a gynecologist so they can figure out which you have and treat it correctly. Sounds like you'll get antibiotics or a topical cream. They also have prescription yeast meds that work better than OTC for future reference. Your bf can be treated too so he doesn't spread it back to you.
