I think one of the harshest and most important things I learned in life was that you have to look out for yourself first and foremost, because nobody else has a stronger incentive to do so.

The way you handled your previous friend is amazing and you deserve props for being so level-headed and firm in redefining your relationship. Friendship is a concept that implies mutual benefit and nobody has the right to expect or demand that you remain in a relationship that is asymmetrical in that aspect. Don't cling to friendships for the value of the concept itself and be mindful that toxic friendships will only block your way to good ones, among doing asorted other harm to your life.

You will find more and better friends if you remain open to making new friends and place yourself in an environment to meet new people. You're still quite young and I am quite confident you have many, many nice people yet to meet in your life. Don't approach friendship as a thing that you are in need of, it can only come naturally.

Most of all though, remain aware that your sense of self is something you own - you and nobody else. If you feel there is something about you to change, change it as best you can. If you feel there is something about you that is good the way it is, nobody in the world has the power to tell you otherwise. If other friends of yours turn out to be trying to use you or manipulate you, oh well, there are plenty of people out there who will treat you better.
