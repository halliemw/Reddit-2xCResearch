I had precocious puberty, and when I was 8, I had the body of a 12-year-old, as was confirmed by bone age x rays. I was put on a drug called Lupron (sp?)  injections for about 2 and a half years that slowed my body clock, and I actually got my period when I was in 5th grade. I, too, was the tallest one in my class, and the Lupron made me gain weight. The injections were done in the thigh muscle every 28 days, and I was very sore, like when you get a tetanus shot. I have to say precocious puberty left me with a distorted body image. I'm still a big woman, but I always picture myself as towering over people, and I'm only 5'5". Be sure to see a doctor, and maybe a counselor so she can fully understand what's happening her body. Best of luck!
