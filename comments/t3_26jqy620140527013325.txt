Everyone else seems to have covered most of your questions so I will just add in that I tried the Diva Cup (and was super excited to switch!) and then had the disappointment of it just not working for me! I am also short (5'0) and I have a very short vaginal canal. There is no way I have ever been able to position the cup where it does not stick out of my body uncomfortably. I trimmed the stem as short as I could and it still just- didn't fit for me. I had similar problems with tampons (I had to angle them to stay in) though so I'm sure it's something you would be aware of by now if you had similar issues!

I also recently switched from the pill to an IUD (~3 months ago) and actually stopped getting my periods- so turned out for the best anyways!

Best of luck!
