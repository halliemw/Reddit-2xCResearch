I'm really glad for you. I read the initial post and it made me super sad that someone could say something like that to you!  Mad props to you for being resilient and not taking that negative feedback and abuse so hard that it did exactly what she was trying you to do, which was make you feel really small and controllable. I'm so glad you were able to continue to march on and find better opportunities in your path.  Good luck to you! :)
