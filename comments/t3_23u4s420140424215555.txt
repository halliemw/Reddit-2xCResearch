Thanks for your response. I'm sorry that you're out of work; that must be very difficult. I do have an insanely long list of questions...so long that I probably could never get around to answering them all. But, I've tried to answer a lot of the common ones, even writing down the answer in my own "voice" so that the response becomes a part of my internal dialogue. I just need more experience interviewing (it's been almost 10 years, so I'm still really "green"). 

I've tried to network a bit to find new opportunities, even looking to my previous employer, but I haven't had any luck so far. :(
