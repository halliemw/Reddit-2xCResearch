I know other people have suggested finding new therapists, and you don't particularly like that idea, but I really think that's where you need to go. See if you can speak with them beforehand or have a trial session where you can talk about what kind of help you are looking for, and what your expectations are. 

Disclaimer: you are absolutely not in the wrong. You are justified in feeling like this constant harassment is bullshit. But the problem is, that just because you want it to go away (and it absolutely shouldn't be something you have to deal with, especially on a daily basis.) it's not going to. You need to learn what to do to make it so that it 
doesn't affect your life in the way that it is.

As for my own advice, try going out with other people. There is strength in numbers, and watching the reactions of your friends may help you formulate new ways to deal with harassment. Don't feed the trolls. Pretend, as difficult as it may be, that you don't realize they're there. Go home and rant about it to your mom, or your boyfriend, or your cat, or the wall. I have pretend fights with people in the bathroom mirror when I get home. These people feed off the reactions, as perverse as it is. Thirdly, and this might sound like an accusation even though it's not meant to be, don't act like a victim. "Just act crazy in public and they will leave you alone," is not valid advice, but "look confident, like someone that people wouldn't want to have a confrontation with," is. Stop with the hoodies and headphones and sunglasses. People who victimize other people are looking for a target, and if your outward appearance says "please leave me alone," they will come straight for you.

Again, it's complete garbage that you're being treated like this and it's affecting your life so much that you don't even feel safe being outdoors. I wish the best for you and hope that the world in general gets better. Good luck.
