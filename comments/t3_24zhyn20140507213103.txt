Earlier today I was thinking about something my dad has done that I really hated:  ask me if I can wear white to my wedding. I felt that the way the question was phrased, he was putting some importance on my virginity that he wouldn't put on my brothers'. This is stupid. A woman's virginity isn't the entirety of her worth as a person, women fuck, big deal. Basically what I'm trying to say is--don't do what my dad did. This is an outdated double standard that needs to die.

Similarly, for the love of god don't play the typical family sitcom overprotective dad role. Yes you should be there for her if/when a guy breaks her heart, but try not to act like she's some delicate flower who has to be protected from every guy within a ten mile radius. I've dated a lot of shit-heads and finally found a guy who is the prince I've been waiting for for a very long time. My dad likes him but because he's trying to be the tough-guy overprotective family sitcom dad, the only praise he's ever given my boyfriend is "he's acceptable". I love my parents and want them to like and get along with the guys I date. Hearing this can be disheartening, and it gets old. I can only imagine what my boyfriend thought about dad saying this.

Let her have her interests. You don't have to like all of them but try to be supportive. (This coming from a rocker chick who went through a goth/emo phase in high school.) My dad lives in the next state over and if a band I liked was goimg through his area but not through mine, he wouldn't let me go to his place and see the show. I'm 100% certain that it was purely cuz he hated my music (mom hates it too but she roughed out the shows she took me to), and it would have been different if he liked my music.

This is all I can think of off the top of my head, but I hope it helps :)
