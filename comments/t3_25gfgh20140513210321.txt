Which is especially shitty, considering that once you get into a larger cross section of (largely) American male youth, you see a lot of people that have no empathy for women. My whole life I've had a ton of empathy for women, and I don't know why it's so hard for so many other men to see women as regular people. It really really infuriates me that subreddits like r/theredpill or r/pussypass even exist, it's like people just trying to find more excuses to hate women. 


Yes, every gender has their advantages and difficulties, but it just seems so fucking stupid that so many people feel the *need* to paint everyone in the female gender with the same brush, and vice versa. It's really just a step away from racism, and in fact it's even more stupid than that cuz you think half the population in the world thinks and acts homogeneously. I just feel like we could do better.
