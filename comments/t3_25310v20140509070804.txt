While I think on the one hand that it does perpetuate the stereotypes that a woman must always look good I think there is another side. How many woman have you seen out and about that wear just wayyyy too much makeup? There are so many girls that overdo it on the makeup and I think that this session can be seen as a way to prevent an uncomfortable conversation about the amount of shit someone has caked onto their face. Just my humble opinion.
Also for reference I think we all need to remember the Charlie Sheen scene from Ferris Bueller. "You wear too much eye makeup. My sister wears too much. People think she's a whore."
