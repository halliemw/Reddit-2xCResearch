I'm also Christian, but most of the Christians I interact with in the "real world" don't place too much emphasis on waiting till marriage. And in my culture, marrying before someone is 30 is seen as young, and marrying before 25 is almost unheard of. 

I'm personally not waiting for marriage, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for people who do. I don't believe that "sexual compatibility" is as cut and dried as some people make it out to be, and I believe that most couples can work at it till they are both satisfied, if there is love and commitment on both sides. 

Best of luck to you, and congratulations on your upcoming marriage!
