I'm late to this but whatever. I have been hoping for female coaches for a while now

Here in the US people were getting pretty pumped for women's soccer but it kinda is upsetting because steamrolling other teams unfortunately only serves to hurt the women's side of the game. 

Perfect example was the Japanese win; I honestly can't say I know how it was before but it looks like the country exploded with support for the women's team. We need that to happen more often and in other countries (coughfrancecough). I love supporting women's soccer but I have to be honest and say that its not fun to watch an obviously mismatched game that will only get worse as the competition stops caring/funding their own teams.
