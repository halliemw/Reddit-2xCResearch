That's exactly what I mean - I was not suggesting that people can completely control evolutionary impulses or choose sexual orientation.  I was suggesting that we are a civilized society.  We are an intelligent species and we have self control.  We can control sexual impulse - I know, because I have zero trouble controlling mine!  That's why I dont buy the 'boys are distracted' thing either. I'm a woman and I have never been distracted in school buy a hot guy.  If you're going to have a dress code, its unfair of you only apply it to one sex and not the other.
