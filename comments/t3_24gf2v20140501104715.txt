I'm about 6 weeks ahead of you, also with a 2 year old. I just had a similar conversation with my husband, although I don't think to the same extent. I think some fear and questioning is normal. It's a huge life change. Not to mention we are tired, sick, and taking care of toddlers. But it sounds like your feelings are starting to interfere with life. It never hurts to talk to someone.  En even of they just chat while you work out some feelings or reassure you that some of these feelings are normal.
