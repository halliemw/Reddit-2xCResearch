Sure, why wouldn't I be?

But let me make one important distinction:

* People of all races and genders should be paid equally for the same work, no matter what, if they have the same qualifications and experience. I am 100% in favor of that.
* Comparing societal averages of female wages against male wages for the entire population will forever "demonstrate" a wage gap - and this will exist for the rest of time until men and women start collectively dropping out of the work force in precisely equal numbers in order to attend to families - i.e., hell will freeze over first. 

That's basically all I have to say on that matter. On, and one final parting note: comparing individual workers pay to their successors or predecessors is highly likely to yield anecdotal data. Show me a trend within a company and I will listen. Show me pay disparity between two workers who have the same title, but are contemporaneous, functioning under different market conditions and business conditions, well, it's like comparing car A outside in a storm with car B in factory settings - without knowing anything more about either car. There are too many variables to be able to isolate meaningful data.
