Something else must be going on in your case because the vast majority of contractors I know know the golden rule of home renovation, the woman makes the call. If there is ever a question about the tile that just came in, is this paint the right color, do we want a border on this etc, that is a question for the woman 9 times out of 10 and it's a poor contractor who doesn't learn that lesson quickly.

There is a corollary though, that is sometimes men in this situation get a little uncomfortable because they may feel less masculine for having someone come in and fix or create something they had some idea that they should be fixing or doing and in that case really good contractors will bridge that gap as well.
