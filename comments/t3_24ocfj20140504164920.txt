I really liked Playtex Sport. Supposedly they do some kind of "layering the cotton two ways" deal or whatever that's supposed to make them less likely to leak. I figured, since I was fairly active at the time, why not give it a shot? I really liked them! I also wear a liner so if I feel a leak starting it doesn't automatically mean my panties are doomed.
