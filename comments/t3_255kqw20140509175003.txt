I saw a lovely hand written sign in the handicap stall in one of the bathrooms at my college. It basically said that the handicap stall was for people who were physically unable to squat, so if you wanted/needed to hover over the toilet to lift the seat up. A few other colourful words were thrown in, but it was a nice message.
