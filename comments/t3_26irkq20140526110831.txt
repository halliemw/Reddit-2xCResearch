so you have got on well with girls in the past yet you're posting about how you cannot get on with girls? this doesn't make sense.

you've clearly had bad experiences with female friends, so it's okay to think negatively of those particular girls. but to allow those experiences to taint your opinion of all girls? that's where the sexism comes in. it also reeks of special snowflake syndrome - "i'm not like other girls!" 

it's pretty obvious why new girlfriends of guys in your group would be intimidated by and/or jealous of you. they have a new relationship with the guy, you have an old one. they're growing close, but you're already close. we're constantly told in this society that guys want sex all the time with everyone, so the girlfriends are probably scared he secretly has a crush on you. if you want to be friends with them, it's up to you to be extra friendly and show that you respect their relationship and aren't trying to steal him or anything like that. it's not that hard to understand.
