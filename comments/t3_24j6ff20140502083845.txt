That is why I wanted to share. We hear so much about getting mommy tracked and having to sacrifice to have it all. I have had to make choices and sacrifices - I am not always home when I want to be and I can't always say yes at work. 

But my husband and I have great communication about what makes us truly happy. He is happiest at home with kids. It took me a long time but I finally allowed myself to admit I am happiest working. I love my kids and my job and I feel like being true to myself is the best model of a strong woman I can give my kids.
