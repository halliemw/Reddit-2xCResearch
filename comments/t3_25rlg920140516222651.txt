I haven't noticed the water slowing down though to be honest, I'm not 100% sure it is the exact same brand that i have but it looks really similar.

Also, don't ruin your crochet hook!  Head to Home Depot and grab an actual [hair snare](http://www.amazon.com/Cobra-Products-00412BL-Zip-It-Cleaning/dp/B000BO9204/ref=sr_1_3?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1400296999&sr=1-3&keywords=hair+snare)! My landlord GAVE me and my housemates one in college and it is gross, but effective.  And much better than your poor expensive crochet hook!
