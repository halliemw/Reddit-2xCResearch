They try, it just rarely works out. And really, what do you expect? Most (if not all) of the story lines are written by men so even if they could write a compelling heroine, it'll still be from a male perspective. Most men are going to be able to create a heroine that can appeal to a woman on her level as well as a woman can. Maybe the real problem is the lack of women in the business who can create a proper heroine to represent females in a less objectifying manner.
