This story really touched me, and I hope everything works out with a minimum of pain for both of you. But I don't see why it can't be God's plan for him, a true believer, to walk through life besides you, a nonbeliever, and to lead you closer to God through his faith and his example. That would also be the true expression of his love for you: trying his best to spend his eternity with you and putting in the time and energy over the course of his life to that end, rather than breaking up and letting you go to Hell so that he can ensure he ends up in Heaven. #whatdreamsmaycome

We are all God's children. If he believes that, then he should believe that God wants all his children to be saved.    

P.S. If he wants you to know God before you get married, I think he should know Satan before he takes Satan as a reason not to get married. I recommend that you both read [Satan: A Biography](http://www.amazon.com/Satan-Biography-Henry-Ansgar-Kelly/dp/0521604028/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400741469&sr=8-1&keywords=Satan+A+Biography). It would be a book in accordance with his beliefs because it just goes through the passages referring to Lucifer/Satan in the Bible and explores who Satan truly is therein.
