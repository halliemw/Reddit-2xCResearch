Look, I get all that. I'm sorry if you feel I'm dismissing you but I'm not. You're the one who's been incapable of answering my question about your opinion about vilifying men (something that, again, is clear in the video that you refuse to watch). I'm trying to understand and listen. You only give a shit about yourself and your only corner of rights.



By your argument, since I'm a man I should put my rights (men's rights) first? I understand that sexism is rampant, but have you ever considered you might be a little scarred from it? You're really on huge defensive and refuse to hear any other points. When you do, your go to is "well you couldn't possibly understand" or you call me ignorant. It's patronizing.



Again, I'm not dismissing anything you said. You're the one doing the dismissing. I'm just saying the equation is more complicated and that it doesn't feel amazing to be part of the group that this subreddit sees as the boogeyman. 



Just for fun: you compared sexism to racism so let me do the same thing. I routinely see, on this subreddit, justification for the trope that is that you have to  be wary of all men. Why? Because men are the rapists. You admit it's a small subset but nonetheless, you need to be careful.



What if I said the same thing about black people? Statistically, they do commit the most crime. Should I be wary of them? Is it ok for me to say this publicly? On a subreddit? Would you let me defend this claim? Surely, in ball your enlightenment about privilege, you realize how absurd that would be...
