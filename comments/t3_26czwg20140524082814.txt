Unfortunately this familiar 'tickle/tingling' that everyone talks about? I only seem to get that a few hours before it actually goes mental, so I tend to go to sleep feeling no different and wake up with an eruption :( but yeah I need to get better at keeping cream on me at all times!

Thanks for the ice cube tip, I've been using salt water this morning will alternate to ice cubes later on :)

Thanks for your help, I'll definitely look into lysine... :)

Yeah I was worried about that, I'm super careful washing my hands anyway, just currently also got Aunt Flo to visit so putting it simply I hate my body >_<
