My time to shine! I experienced a very rare side-effect while taking Zoloft: fecal incontinence.

The funniest was the time I shat myself at work. I was sitting at my desk, bashing away at my keyboard, when my bowels tapped my shoulder. 'Excuse me, BlackCat, but could you please visit the bathroom?' Sigh. 'Not now, bowels, *I'm busy!*' ... 30 seconds later: 'FUCK YOU, BLACKCAT, WE ARE AT CODE BROWN. REPEAT, CODE BROWN! IMMINENT EVACUATION!' 

I sprinted to the toilet like a bullet from a gun, butt unfortunately for me, my desk could not be further from the toilet. When I get there, I'm detained for a few crucial seconds by a twittering bunch of girls from another department. GET OUT OF MY FUCKING WAY. 

Just as I got to the stall and closed the door, the tsunami burst from the deep depths of my bowels. I was wearing tights (stockings) so the liquid shit pretty much went *everywhere*. In my vagina. Up my back. Down my legs. Did I mention shit in my *vagina?* And the smell? *Diabolical*. If Satan came up with a signature scent, that would be it.

What could I do? How can I hide that evil smell? I had nowhere to dispose of my decimated undies and tights. Shit shit shit. HOLY SHITUATION, BATMAN! I mopped up as best I could, wrapped the evidence up in a giant ball of toilet paper, balled it up in my jacket then told my boss that I was sick and went home.

RIP, lovely green lacy undies. Yes, I showered for an hour. No, by some kind of miracle I did not get a UTI. Mind you, my littlest girl regularly has shit in her vagina and she is a UTI-free zone. Looks like vaginas have that shit covered.
