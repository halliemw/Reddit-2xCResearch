On the flip side, it also opens it up to people who need/want it but didn't know it was here.

Being new to Reddit (as in, about two days old new) I love that TwoX is a default. I had no idea there was anything like this on Reddit, so - although I don't have most of the issues a lot of ladies on here are faced with - I'm massively happy that the "safe space" is being promoted to people who otherwise might not even have considered Reddit as a viable place to look for advice/safety (my outsider's perspective on Reddit was "about one carriage up from 4Chan on the safety train", and I doubt I'm the only one to think that)

(I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who appreciates the safety rather than as someone who needs it, though - I know the raging dickbile the influx brings will absolutely destroy the sense of safety for some, and I sincerely hate that, I'm just trying to find the positive in the default >.<)
