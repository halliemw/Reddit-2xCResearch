CDC Guidelines:
http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm

The 5 years thing is for women of a certain age with a history of normal pap screens. The reason for this is that most people clear these infections on their own, so if you reach a certain age without abnormality - the likelihood is that you were already exposed and cleared it. The reason for reducing the use of this screening down from annually is due to the rate of interventions when there are abnormal results. These interventions carry their own risks to reproductive health. The new guidelines better reflect that balance of risk and benefit to Pap screening.
