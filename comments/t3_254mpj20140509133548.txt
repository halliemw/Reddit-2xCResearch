The most recent was last month. I had decided to buy the 'Diva Cup' which is a product you insert and it will catch all the period stuffs, you remove it, dump it into the toilet, wash it and put it back in. It was highly recommended from a friend and I thought it was a good idea because you don't have to use tampons or pads ever again.

Well...I don't know if I'm just too fat or my arms are just to short but I couldn't get it back out. I could feel the little tip where you were supposed to pull but it would always slip after grabbing. So after 30 minutes of trying I went back downstairs  and started crying at my boyfriend a the time and he offered to dig it out. I was just really embarrassed because I couldn't get it out and he had to.
