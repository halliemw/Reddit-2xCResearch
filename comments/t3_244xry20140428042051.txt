Yeah, they still use the +4 method. I have a 26.5" underbust and a 36" bust and they said I'm a 30DDD, which isn't too far off - I usually wear a 28G/GG in UK sizes, and I have a few Betsey Johnson bras in 30DD/30DDD that fit fine. 

What makes me really happy is that unlike VS, if you put in measurements that don't fit one of their sizes, apparently they say "bummer! we don't actually carry your size. but we have tons of other cute things you might like! (shop undies)". Now if they'd just fix the +4 issue...
