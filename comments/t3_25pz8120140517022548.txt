I feel like a weirdo reading these comments. After my double discectomy I was fine!

I was walking alone in 24h, and in a week I was already back to classes.
I stopped taking my pain meds before the recommended time (I felt no pain, only the numbness of my leg) and everything was normal.


I do have another hernia now, though.
