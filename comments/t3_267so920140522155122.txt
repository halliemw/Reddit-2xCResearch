I think it's water retention/bloating mixed with my pelvic tilt seen as it gets bigger and smaller regularly, and when it does bloat it's uncomfortable and sometimes painful. 

I'm aware that I am, by BMI standards, slightly underweight but I'm perfectly healthy, and don't actually look underweight. I'm very small at the top, but I have large hips, butt and kind of muscular thighs. Anyone can be any weight/height but everyone carries differently. :) Honestly, a pooch is going to happen when you have wide hips, but it's pretty annoying to have one that grows and shrinks and can be generally painful at times!
