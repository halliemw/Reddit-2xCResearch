I did long distance for almost a year and it didn't work out because my SO and I were not actually very compatible. However, I think LDRs can be very successful as long as both people but the right amount of work into it. Here are some tips that worked for me while I was in it:

1. Force yourself to communicate verbally. You no longer have the luxury of using body language, passive aggression, silent treatment, gifts, etc to make your point. You have to just say it.
2. Schedule time every day to talk. Like a 1 hr Skype session every night at 10 PM. Or, text consistently throughout the day. (Or both, depending on your relationship). 
3. Make definite plans for when you see each other next, and always have the next date to look forward to.
4. Skype sex. Sexting. Lots of it.
5. /r/LongDistance. A super supportive sub with lots of great cute ideas to do for your SO.
6. Most importantly: Have lives outside of each other. Two of my best friends have done successful LDRs and its largely because their day to day lives center around their own social lives and hobbies, not missing their SO. My SO and I failed largely because we did not have lives outside of each other and Skyped each other all the time. When one of us did go out and have fun instead of being supportive and happy we were jealous and petty of each other's fun. It is a lesson that I have learned and hope to impress upon other people navigating the scary waters that are long distance.

Good luck!
