There's actually a House MD episode (4x10) where someone has a similar condition. Of course, it's all as overblown and dramatic as House tends to be, but if you want to veg out in front of the TV and spend 40 minutes being glad you weren't misdiagnosed with lupus first, your ailment has totally gotten the Hollywood Treatment.

(Please don't take this as me trying to be frivolous or disrespectful; I always like seeing people like me (i.e. butch lesbians) in the media and I thought you might, too. Of course, homo-storylines generally feature less rushing around with IV bags.)
