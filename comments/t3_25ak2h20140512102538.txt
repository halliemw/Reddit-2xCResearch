Alright, I've not read a whole lot about this in the thread, so I'm going to interject here. 

My parents divorced when I was thirteen. My father has never been abusive--just lazy. He had no interest in being a father; either that, or he never had any idea how and didn't try. Honestly, I wish they had divorced long before then, and more importantly, I have serious issues from being treated by him the way I have been. 

He's never been mean to me in any abusive way, and he's never treated me poorly, per-se--he just never had an interest in me. He did what he was "supposed" to (and it sounds like your ex is doing less than that) and no more. I've always felt like I need validation from people that I'm not a waste of space. I feel robbed of a father. 

On a purely emotional level, I'd say do it. Your daughter can get another father figure. Your ex is completely useless to her emotional well being and will only hurt her.
