Oh no, don't give up hope. I was not capable of a good relationship until I turned 28, when I met my husband. I just didn't have it in me to be good in a relationship until that point. I put the pressure on way too high, my expectations of commitment were way too intense, I could not see how pretty I was....the list goes on. When I met my husband....I just let it go. I focused on having the time of my life with a great guy and I let thoughts about the future go. And it worked. When I took the pressure off to become I blossomed into just being and it allowed the best part of me to show. And about the tall thing.....my husband is 3 inches shorter than me and the best I have ever had. People just want tall girls to be with tall guys because they think it fits. But everyone fits together just fine if they want to.
