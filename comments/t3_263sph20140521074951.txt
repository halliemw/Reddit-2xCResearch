Peeing after sex is absolutely key. Even if you can only pee a tiny bit, it's better than not peeing at all. 

You could also try avoiding peeing just before sex and rather empty your bladder a little while before you think you may be having sex. This way you won't have a full bladder during the deed and should be able to pee afterwards.

So many references to pee...
