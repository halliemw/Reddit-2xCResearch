First of all, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that you are going through this and that I echo the thoughts of other commentors in that it seems like you dodged a bullet. Everyone deserves to be treated well in their relationships, and that was not the case toward the end of yours.

With regard to your sense that you can trace his abrupt change back to the introduction of G into his life- it's been my experience that in relationships, sometimes the people we are with bring out the best in us, and other times they bring out the worst in us. I just wanted to say that it's possible that the inclination toward all of the negative behaviors and decisions he's been making recently has always been present in him. But it also sounds like there were a lot of positive qualities in the mix as well. Perhaps in the early stages of your relationship, your connection helped to bring out all the good stuff, but as he's expanded his circle of close friends to include G, they have brought out some of the other tendencies.

Whatever the reason, I'm sorry that he betrayed your trust and led you on. I hope that you are able to get back your things, as well as some peace of mind about those pictures. Good luck!
