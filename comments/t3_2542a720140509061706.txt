> There was some cramping and blood, like a bad period really.

I hope you won't be offended if I ask how far along you were? I had a medical abortion at about 7-8 weeks, and the pain was horrific, though still short of the no-go 9 week mark. I would just like to see if that being that far along is what made it so painful, or if it's down to my underlying disorder, as I feel like a bit of a wimp for always being the woman saying "but it was so painful for me". 


>In the end it would've been wrong to have that baby, but it was still difficult to not have it.

This really resonates with me. You've really expressed something that I found difficult to put into words.
