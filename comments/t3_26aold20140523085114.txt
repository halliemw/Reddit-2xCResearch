The first step is recognizing you have these feelings, and you've done that. 

Is it possible for you to acknowledge and then compartmentalize these feelings? So, if your coworker gets a promotion, let the jealous thoughts come. Let it play out in your head completely — "why don't I get promotions? That's not fair!" Be as jealous as you want. Once you're done having the self-centered feelings, think to yourself "okay, I recognize I am jealous and I wish I was sharing the same success. Now I am done." Then put it aside. 

What I am saying is let the feelings come, **own them** completely in your own head, and then acknowledge these feelings are not healthy. Replace them with positivity. 

I've just never had any luck trying to "ignore" my unhealthy thoughts — it's always worked better for me to acknowledge how I am feeling and then work through how unhealthy it is. It really helps to write your feelings down in private, too.
