I wouldn't say I'm adamant about it, but I tend to agree with the officer. This was a drug-addled man who has physically attacked you and outright told you that he's going to rape you.

He WAS going to do those things if given a chance. By not hurting him, you were taking the risk of him somehow turning the situation around (grabbing the knife, or who knows what) so that he could continue his assault.

What you did imo is the equivalent of finding a highly venomous snake in your home, and trying to trap it with a cardboard box and release it outside (at the risk of being bitten), rather than killing it and eliminating the threat immediately.

But of course... taking a human life is a very different thing, something no one wants to have on their conscious. I'm very glad things worked out well for you in the end, and I'm glad you were well prepared enough to have a knife ready for a situation like this.
