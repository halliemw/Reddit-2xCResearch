Look -- I'm imagining this guy is my dad.  My dad is old...and can say all sorts of things that sound incredibly offensive.  Has he kept up with the times?  Hell no.  He's OLD!  It is harder for older people to change than younger people, seriously.

I could totally see him saying things like OP said...somehow misguidedly thinking they were amusing to men and women alike.

At the same time, he's the nicest guy you've ever met.  If someone told him he said something which hurt their feelings or insulted them, he'd genuinely feel bad about it, and he'd try to learn from it.  He would probably still say stuff he shouldn't...but he'd at least try not to.

Not everyone is an evil minion of the patriarchy -- sometimes people are just normal people who don't realize how bad the stuff from their generation sounds today.
