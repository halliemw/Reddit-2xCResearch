Well since y'all didn't expect him to go this far with his education maybe the army would be a good place for him. And with his benefits he can go back to school later. My SO was in the army and it gave him a good start in life.  He learned discipline,  how to take care of expenses first then fun things, even now he is very focused on taking care of business.  He now works at Bell and is in school full time which is paid by the government for his service.  And with the money for school we are saving for a home which we will be buying next year. This could be a better option as a start of a career and better able to support his child then minimum wage job at McDonald's.
