Personally, I have had this experience before. I have two very close male friends of mine. I have had feelings for both of them in the past, there was flirting etc. Nothing really happened with that and we moved on, but still are very close. One of them is pretty much my rock in terms of dealing with guy issues etc and I in return act as a confidante in a similar manner.

Guys are just humans with different parts, so make sure you have similar interests etc. Make sure you like the interactions you have with the person are positive on all sides. Sure a bit of flirtation is fine as well as along as everyone is comfortable with it.

So treat them like people basically.
