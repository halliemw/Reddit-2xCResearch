Yeah, I could totally see it actually. Do you think George Clooney has never openly cried in movies? I don't see how it's weird to cry and panic when you're literally floating around in space with zero communication or connection to any other human being and probably a million percent chance of dying slowly and horribly. And even then, she definitely didn't just cry and panic the whole time; I actually thought it was crazy how resilient and determined she was to power forward overall.
