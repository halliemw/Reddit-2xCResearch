I'm dealing with this situation right now, actually. My fiancé and I are in our late twenties and I've known since I was very young that I didn't want to have biological children. My fiancé also isn't on the baby-bandwagon. This is something we've both discussed extensively and agree upon. We are cool with the idea of perhaps adopting one day, but that's a far cry from filling the world with our biological progeny. Anyway, the point of my story is that I can empathize with you, especially when it comes to your frustration. Our game plan is to continue using birth control until the doctors realize we're not just a pair of fickle dimwits.
