As a tall guy I can sort of confirm this, when I was younger it seemed like whenever some asshole was looking for a fight I was the go-to guy to pick a fight with. The kind of person who is actively looking for a fight is often doing so to boost their ego or social status in some way, you don't accomplish this by picking a fight with someone smaller than yourself (or putting it another way: There's less of an ego/status penalty for sucker-punching someone bigger than you to gain an unfair advantage than there is in picking a "fair" fight with someone smaller than you).
