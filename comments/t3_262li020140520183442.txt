1) I do accept that the posters might have been a bit alienating. If I had been in charge of posters, I would've taken a different stance.

2) Yes, I know. I'm not saying all dress codes are terrible. I'm saying that if dress codes are in place, it should be an all-or-none deal. Either have it in both high school and junior high, our neither. The only one we have (marginal) control over is the one in our school, so that's what we're dealing with.

3) Actually, this happens to a surprising number of people I know (even ones you wouldn't consider "reckless"). Besides, I'm not saying that everybody would dress crazy scandalous, but they certainly wouldn't keep imposing the dress code on themselves on their own merit. So all-in-all, nothing's really being accomplished by this code.
