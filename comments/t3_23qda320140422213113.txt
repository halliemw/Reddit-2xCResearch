I'm 22, so it's been about 4 years now since I graduated. I remember I kinda wanted to go to prom, my SO didn't, but I wasn't broken up about it. I didn't like most of my classmates, I didn't like the popular music of the time, and I've never really felt inclined to go dancing, so in the end I figured I probably wasn't missing much. So we treated prom night like a regular weekend and played Borderlands at my house instead. Of course, you see less of a social outcast and bitch-hermit than I was/am, but even still, you shouldn't get so hung up about it. I mean, yeah, it sucks that there's really no compromise to the situation, but that's life sometimes. In a few years, you probably won't care and if you're still together with your SO, you can probably look back on this and think about how it made you a bit more mature for recognizing something important to your SO an making a sacrifice for them. On a side note, his parents were dicks for making him take another girl to her prom when you, his girlfriend, were uncomfortable with it and he probably shouldn't have agreed to do that in the first place if you made your feelings known.
