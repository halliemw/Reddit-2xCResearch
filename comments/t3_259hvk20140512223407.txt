That's a very sad story, and a ridiculous request. Why would you want me to be cruel to your friend? Clearly he's been through a tragedy and I wouldn't ever pile on top of that to prove my convictions to a random redditor. He'd understandably never take it for what it's worth  because he is, of course, emotional about the tragedy that his family suffered.

Yes, there are always going to be a small number of abnormal situations. Sometimes you act responsibly and still get dealt a shit hand. I've happily and voluntarily helped several friends who were facing financial emergencies. 

I stand by my quoted point. You should only have babies you can reasonably expect to be able to support. We're not talking about your friend's unique situation. We're talking about a broad policy to force people to pay directly for other people's choices.
