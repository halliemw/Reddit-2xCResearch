I had two that I really loved. There are a couple books by Monica Furlong about a girl named Juniper. Wise Child is the title. Its fantastic. Even at my age, I might reread.

Also Patricia C. Wrede. She has a whole series of books about a Princess that decides to work for dragons instead of getting married off to a Prince. I believe the first one is called Dealing with Dragons. Oh and the "king" dragon is actually female.
