You are incredibly brave for venturing out into the unknown to do what you know is best for yourself and for your own safety.  I have no practical advice for what comes next, but I'd say it's a fair bet your dad exhibits some traits that fall within cluster B personality disorders, narcissism being one of them.  /r/raisedbynarcissists and /r/NarcissisticAbuse might be helpful for you.  

Please, whatever you take away from this, don't think for a moment that YOU tore the family apart.  Your dad did that all by himself, with some help from your mother who is acting as an enabler.  This may not mean much to you right now, and it probably even shouldn't because you've got a lot of more immediate needs to deal with, but often when someone is caught between two people they love they will take the side of the stronger, or less dependent, or the one they are most dependent upon, and victim-blame the other.  Even if the victim is their own child.  This is an enabler's way of coping with stress and conflict because they're unable to stand up to the person they're in a co-dependent relationship with. 

Anyway, I'm sorry I don't have any better advice for you, but I'm very glad to hear you're out of there and in a safe place now and that you've got friends to back you up.  Best wishes to you!
