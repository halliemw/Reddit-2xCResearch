Perhaps they are flirting with you because they like to flirt (as do a large number of people). Your dress style doesn't "invite" flirtatious comments. Your breathing invites some people to flirt with you.    


Of course that doesn't mean you have to put up with it if it is something you don't enjoy. If the fact that you don't flirt back, or laugh doesn't tell that person you don't appreciate their behavior then flat out tell him.    

It is even okay to tell one person not to flirt while allowing others to do so. I've notice that some people are great at casual flirting that is just for fun and is usually reciprocated, whereas others creep the person out by flirting.
