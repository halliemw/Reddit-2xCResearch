Yes, things do get better.  If it helps:  22 years in a relationship (not without problems) that's going strong and is ideal for me, which includes not being abusive (something both of us share in common, neither of us wants to be abusive).

The OP's boyfriend, though, relishes (so far) what he's been doing.  IMO.
