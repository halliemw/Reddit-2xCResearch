The fact that people with mental illnesses are treated poorly should be a reason for you to *want* us to discuss his hatred and misogyny, to be honest. You know why? Because talking about spree killers only in the sense of highlighting their illness only serves to stigmatise them further. There are many mentally ill people who *do not* go on spree killings, and that's in large part because they aren't driven by seething hatred. 

So we need to strike a delicate balance - emphasise that mental illness is something that our society needs to work on and fix, but also emphasise the fact that this man's hatred also fuelled his actions. Which goes back to my original point: we need to talk about both.
