You are much better with words than I am. This is exactly why I'm a little a annoyed with the direction this sub is going.

I have barely seen any "male infiltration" like everyone is so scared of. But if we had the chance to show everyone that women could talk about more than just periods and babies, it's been wasted. This sub is being self destructed by the very users that built it up.
