I can totally sympathize with you. My mom is an immigrant, close-minded, and she doesn't like change. I still love her a ton. But she has been physically and emotionally abusive when she had a bipolar episode. One hallmark of an abusive relationship is that there is no room for you to use or be appreciated for your personal growth, and this is how its always been with me and her. We still don't connect on a mental level, we're just too different.
