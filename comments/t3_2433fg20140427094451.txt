This happens to me all the time. I assumed that it was because I live in Central PA. My FIL still thinks that a woman should always walk on a certain side (left or right of him, can't remember) and a few steps back. Now, I'm from NJ. He told me this over Christmas dinner, and I literally paused in shock and then burst into laughter in his face.
