Sorry, but there's nothing illegal about taking pictures of someone's ass. Creepy sure, but that's about it. Let the guy know that it's been bothering you, that you are not OK with it, and you would really appreciate if going forward he would refrain from ever doing anything like that in your presence.

EDIT: I didn’t fully consider the harassment/ethical angle; She should definitely report the incident. Whether or not anything can be done about it is beside the point, it should be documented, and as someone else pointed out it’s likely she can remain anonymous.
