Ads have to appeal to the majority of women, and there's no way they can resonate with *all* women. You're right that O'Connor generalized that women wanted storytelling ads, and that's a good point. However, I think that's the nature of marketing. Advertisers know they need to get the majority, and it's implicit that not all people will be positively affected, even if they agree with the premise of the advertisement. Men and women do not experience advertisements in the same way (google "do men and women see advertisements differently?"), and I think this article was meant to be a *brief* look at *one* way in which Republicans are changing their campaign strategies for the upcoming election to target a demographic that they did poorly with in the last season.  

Like I said before, I don't think it follows that because O'Connor or Republicans are trying to target women with storytelling ads means that they think women are dumb. I would suspect that men don't like the ads with numbers either, although this was not addressed in the article, nor was it implied that men *do* like ads with numbers more. I just don't see anything inherently wrong or sexist with the strategy.
