We've already begun responding, but the problem I have with his argument now is that it disapproves of most forms of intimacy, which I'm assuming involved a lot of physical contact. Touching and contact is a huge part of social development, and I don't think it should be forbidden at all. Furthermore, a monogamous, wedlock relationship doesn't work for everybody and can't be universally applied. His argument is too black-and-white to work for everyone.
