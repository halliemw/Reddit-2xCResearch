I've heard from some other mods of new defaults that the admins wanted to keep these changes a secret until they announced it officially.  That being said, I agree with you completely. Nothing good will come for this sub by being a default. If I were a mod here, I would have declined the offer from the admins immediately. I understand that they want something in the defaults to attract some new demographics, but this was not it. 

I have to give credit to these mods though for being willing to take on the challenge of running the most controversial default ever in the history of reddit. But I honestly don't think it will last. Right now it may not be too bad but eventually they are going to get overwhelmed. Hopefully I am wrong about this but I just don't see it going down any other way.
