First off I'm sorry you're getting down voted. 

Second, I wish I could offer better advice. I am 28 and in the midst of a similar battle with my mother. Reading your story was almost like reading my own, except I don't even seem to have a similar hobby in common. I wish I could tell you that what I am trying is working but I think maybe there are mothers who-when all they very wanted was to be a mother, like mind- don't know how to make that switch. I know my mom struggles to see me as an individual, and not just her daughter. I cannot get her to view our relationship as one that needs work, and when I did call her on some shot last year I am still waiting for a response. 

What am I do? I keep trying. Because my mom didn't give up on me, ever. And so I don't get to give up on her. Every day I model the relationship I want with her and when she pushes too hard I end the conversation. I have become the adult. And it's not perfect and I wish we could be friends but I at least know that I have turned this into a relationship that is no longer painful. 

I hope this helps. Maybe it's too much about me. Either way, you're not the only one.
