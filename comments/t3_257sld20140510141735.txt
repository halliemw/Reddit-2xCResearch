I feel like these ladies were just being rude and projecting their disdain of growing old onto you. It's one thing to request not being referred to as "ma'am", or even to say "i'm not *that* old", but to go that extra mile to juvenile town says more about them than "ma'am", IMO.

Is it breaking the rules to wonder what role gender plays on how something as innocent as "yes, ma'am" is perceived?
