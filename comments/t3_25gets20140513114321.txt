I'm not so sure body hair is so disconnected with gender ideas.

I mean, I don't know any guys who would claim that their beards don't have anything to do with manliness.  And there is definitely something about a bush that is feminine as hell.

But it is *just hair* isn't it?  But then, gender is just a body thing, too.
