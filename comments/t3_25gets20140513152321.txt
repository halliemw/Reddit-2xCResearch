The way I feel about it is this. We live in a society with certain beauty standards. If you want to be 'accepted' by that society then you will have to follow those standards and you will get the perks that come with those standards(acceptance), but you will also get the annoying parts that come with those standards (like shaving). Now, if you really hate those standards you have two options, you can try and change those standards or you can just do whatever the hell you want. Now, I tend to just do whatever the hell I want. My body is not shaved half the time. Now, if you choose to do whatever the hell you want, you have to understand that not everyone is going to accept that, but it comes with the territory. You find a subset of that society that will accept you the way you are!
