I'm angry too just reading this! I'm not sure what to say, there are so many comments. The "she should expect that" ones...since when are intimate photos obtained without consent part of this? What kind of guy thinks that's okay ? Also, the whole "they're just discovering balls" business is ridiculous. Men aren't apes . I know plenty that managed puberty without violating someone like this. I hate when they speak like it's a normal part of becoming a man. It's not. Maybe becoming a man who keeps harassing women and probably escalates...but not becoming a regular dude.
