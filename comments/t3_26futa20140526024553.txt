Actually, he not only exhibited misogynist behaviours, but racist ones as well. In general, he seemed to feel hatred towards most anyone. So a reasonable argument could be made that he was really just dissociated from humanity. Sure a focus for his frustrations revolved around women, but is anyone surprised that that would happen with a socially awkward young heterosexual male?

I'd guess he was a misogynist and he appears to have been influenced by misogyny around him, but the framing of the discussion that this happened because of misogyny makes as much sense as claims it happened because of the NRA.
