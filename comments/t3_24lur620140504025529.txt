That's one example of internalization. People internalize things in different ways, and the fact is our culture perpetuates a narrow standard of excellence of which only the woefully ignorant are unaware. However, the amazing thing is that the status quo does not deter everyone, and that is why people of groups not typically associated as strongly with excellence still succeed. Not everyone is a pessimist.
