Well, I've had many strange experiences throughout my life so I am not so worried about the metaphysical aspect of it all(a catatonic state after a surgery mistake last year kinda ensured that). Let's just say that my thoughts on it are a blend of Bill Hicks and Alan Watts through the lens of the dark side.

Sadly my vagina will never bear any children, but at the same time I am kinda happy that blessing/burden is not  upon me this time around. I feel like I have yet to grow much more before facing that again.

I know what you mean about the hospital bed. In my third surgery last year I had to recover in a ward filled with mature to old people with cancers(mostly bowel ones) and other bowel problems(burst colon and such), and seeing so much pain and suffering made me realize I never want to experience old age. Emptiness of old age and the increasing possibility of such suffering is no way appetizing to my mind. It's actually at that point I decided that if I were ever diagnosed with cancer(or similar suffering) I'd aim to end it rather than going through it all. On the up side, I do not have much real life obligation to keep on ticking if that were to happen. In that respect I am in a way blessed.
