When a woman gets raped she gets asked "what were you wearing? Where you leading him on? etc." The implication made is that she was asking for it. Women's credibility is doubted when dealing with rape/sexual assault/sexual harassment. Just like minorities are not given the benefit of the doubt in the legal system to the extent that whites are.
