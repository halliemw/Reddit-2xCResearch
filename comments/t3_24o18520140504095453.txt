I think having a doctor who does a LOT of insertions can really help. It hurt when I got my Mirena as well, but really only the measuring part - I was gritting my teeth pretty damn hard during that, but when she said the IUD was already in, I was like "wait, really?". I had NO bleeding or cramping afterwards, just gnarly cramps during my first period and about 2 months of spotting following that first period since I had been off BC for a while when I got Mirena inserted. 

I will definitely be asking for that particular doctor again if my husband and I aren't ready to start trying yet when this Mirena needs to be replaced.
