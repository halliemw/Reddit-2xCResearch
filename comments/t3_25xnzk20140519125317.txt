Your link provides no substantive statistics on gender breakdown. A '20-40%' range is effectively useless. Further, I specified 'action comics', which the mostly-hypothetical assessments in the link don't categorize.

>That logic also means you're alienating a large percentage of your readers because the majority like sexism. Seems like a bad business decision.

If it is a bad business decision, presumably the action comic book segment is (or will be) suffering financially as a result.

>It is sexist. And if you've read any if those magazines, you'd see its overwhelmingly women in the covers and the focus within. When men are featured, they're not half naked in physically impossible poses like women often are in comics. Its a false equivalency.

Neither example is sexist, nor is it a false equivalency. Rather, each form of media is targeted to a specific demographic: young people of a particular gender. 

In the magazines I mentioned, a cursory survey will reveal a myriad of images and verbiage pandering to gender-specific "female" roles (focus on appearance, fashion, dieting) and will further present men in a sexually objectified manner (currently "hot" male stars, boyfriend advice). Most of the denigration or objectification of males is text-based rather than visual.

If you've read any action comics, the overwhelming majority of them have male heroes on the covers and the focus within. Action comics with a female lead character make up a very tiny percentage of the total.
