PMS is real.  However, only about 6% of women have mood or emotional symptoms that affect their day to day lives.  The problem is that a lot of pop culture loves to blame everything women do on our periods.  Yes, some women are a bit more sensitive for a few days of their cycle, but most of us aren't.  I may be a bit more irritable when I have cramps, but that's because I'm in pain.  I'm also more irritable when I have a migraine, and that can happen at any time of the month.  Even with a migraine or menstrual cramp, I don't become an irrational rage monster who takes offense at everything.  My tolerance for bullshit simply goes down.  Most of the time, I just keep my annoyance to myself when someone is rude to me, but when my bullshit tolerance has been lowered by some physical pain, I'm a lot more likely to respond to the rudeness.

So guys, when a woman gets annoyed at you, it's possible that she could be overly sensitive because of hormones, but it's more likely that you actually are acting like a douche.
