Short answer: yes.  Long answer: would take like a million years to type, because my mom is also a narcissist (in a properly pathological way).  At this point, I am in touch with her, but I keep it very limited, in frequency and duration, and also don't really get into anything personal with her.  It's way more manageable if I keep things at a surface "let's talk about the weather" kind of level with her.

I would definitely suggest that you click on over to r/raisedbynarcissists.  I think you will find some good support, or at least a place to hear about similar experiences, and find some validation for whatever choices you decide to make about your relationship with your mom.
