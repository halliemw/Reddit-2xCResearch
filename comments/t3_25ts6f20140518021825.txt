You poor thing! I had almost this exact same thing (well, the OMGPOOPINGNOW moments) but fortunately I work from home and the bathroom is right next to my office. Fuck Zoloft, I was going (not exaggerating) 20+ times a day. 

Thankfully I switched to something else for my anxiety and it stopped completely. This is AFTER my doctor told me "Lol not the meds, you probably need your colon removed." I was already there for anxiety and she went THERE before any other tests or trying a different medication. Needless to say, I switched docs immediately.
