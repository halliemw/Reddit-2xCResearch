Try talking to the guy about what happened. I may get down-voted but sometimes signals are read wrong especially when drunk. By not saying anything in that situation it can make the signals especially hard to decipher.

I am not saying what he did is ok but he might not realise what he did was not ok. Its silly to lose out on an entire social group because of a mistake. If he apologise and learns from this that could be a good thing, it might make him more aware of boundaries in the future and you could find a lot of friends. If he brushes it off as no big deal than he is a dick.
