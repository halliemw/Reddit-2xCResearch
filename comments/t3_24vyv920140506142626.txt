I get that maybe it's a bit silly to have trigger warnings everywhere, but it's important for abuse survivors so that they don't' re-live the experience.   


If you have never been sexually abused then simply  ignore the trigger warning.  News flash, it isnt about YOU. It's about people who have gone through abuse.  Stop being narcissistic and be more empathetic of others experi9ence/situations.   This reminds me of those people who get mad that the world has become too 'pc' as if it's such a huge problem to not refer to people as 'coloured'
