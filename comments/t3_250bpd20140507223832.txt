I went to a high school with uniforms. And yes, that post is a great critique of dress codes in general. 

Because at my school--yes, boys had uniforms, and they had to abide by them. They were occasionally pulled out of class by the harsher teachers and forced to shave in the nurse's office, because no facial hair allowed. No idea why that was a rule, but here's what it wasn't: a judgement of the decency of people's bodies.

With girls, the biggest issue was skirt length, and that absolutely was such a judgement. I was also told to leave a classroom once--as soon as I entered it--and I walked to the office and a woman put a ruler to my leg to see if my uniform skirt was the appropriate length above my knee. That's not about "looking professional" (like I suspect the beard issue was): it was about policing our bodies. I had a teacher say that the clothes girls wear during dress-down days make her "uncomfortable." My body, in its natural form, would make her uncomfortable. And that teaches you some shameful things. I'm not about to go suggesting that we all live in nudist colonies, but--it doesn't feel right that I'm uncomfortable wearing shorts in college classes, that I feel like I have to throw a cardigan on over my tank top even when the temperature is in the 80s.

How to fix this? I don't know. Personally, I am comfortable as long as I'm not looking at someone's nipples or genitalia (or the undergarments covering those specific regions--bra straps, you're fine). Personally, I also feel that uniforms were a bad choice for my school. They were expensive, hot, uncomfortable, and universally unflattering. I'm sure they could be made, and enforced, in a positive way.
