> Super frustrating, because it's like, there's nothing so dreadful about being straight, but I'm not! So I guess I get that, even though my first instinct was kind of "what's so bad about being seen as gay?", and that might still be something worth thinking about.

You know, this was totally my first reaction too. Like why do people get so offended at implications of being gay? But thinking about it more, I feel like the frustrating part is choosing to self-identify a certain way and having people tell you that you're wrong.
