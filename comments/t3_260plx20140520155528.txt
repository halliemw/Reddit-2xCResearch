Same thing happened to me but we still live close. I've been friends with 2 sisters for our entire lives. We were inseparable for the first 17 years of our lives. Then over the next 10 or so years we started doing our own thing though still get together for birthdays, go to the bar sometimes, always get together for Halloween and chat often. I got married 3 years ago and they were my only bridesmaids besides my sister. 

Fast forward to this year when one of the sisters tells me excitedly that she's engaged to her boyfriend that she's been with since she was 17. It's not until I get an e-mail a week later from her sister throwing dates around for the bachelorette party that I realize I'm not in the wedding: "The bridesmaids and I were wondering if this sounded like a good idea..." 

Oh. You and the bridesmaids. It was like a slap in the face. 

I thought it was telling that during the wedding shower, I was the one who got all of the quiz questions right about her life because I've known her the longest and was there for every event.

I thought it was shitty that she didn't ask me to do *anything* involved with the wedding. I am a vocalist, I'dve been happy to sing something. Or even hand out programs. Hell, I was passing out duties like crazy for my wedding so no one would feel left out.

Try not to get too upset even though I know it sucks. She may have a purely logical reason you haven't even thought of- for example, in my case, maybe it's that I'm a tom-boy and have never really liked dresses or girly things. Maybe she thought I wouldn't be interested because of that. Oh well. It took me a while but I guess I'm over it. 

Hey, at least we don't have to pay for some shitty dress we'll only wear once!
