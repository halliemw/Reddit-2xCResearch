As a manager for minimum wage positions, we're mostly aware that if we're hiring people totally over qualified for the position (especially in this economy) they're going to bail sooner than later. Many people are looking for a temporary income while they're looking for their more permanent position. I don't see how the OP is putting anyone in a "shitty situation." At minimum wage, everyone is replaceable.
