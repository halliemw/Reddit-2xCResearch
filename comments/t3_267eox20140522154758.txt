Please watch this "lecture" (actually a debate): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hb3oe7-PJ8

Gender differences between "liberal arts" stuff and science, and even within sciences themselves, precisely follow a spectrum in which females are more interested in the liberal arts side and males and more interested in the science side. This is only a statistical difference so both males and females are represented everywhere, however the gender difference gets larger towards the extremes of each side of the spectrum.

Programming and other highly theoretical pursuits are at the extreme end of the spectrum with the hard sciences, which males are naturally more interested as a proportion. This doesn't mean that no women can be interested in programming but it does mean that the percentage will always be very far away from 50/50.
