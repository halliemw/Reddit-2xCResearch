Hey,

You need to feel like crap for a few days.  I remember after my first break up (found out the guy cheated on me with three of his ex's), I think I cried every other hour nonstop.  It got to the point where my mom just didn't say anything anymore, just gave me a box of tissues, kissed my forehead, and gave me space.  You just need to let it out.

It sucks.  It really does.

But at some point you have to get yourself together.. Get out of your room and do something..Go for a run, go for a swim, watch a movie, hang out with some friends or family, go out to lunch with your mom.. Slowly, you start healing.  It doesn't feel as bad.  You don't cry as much.  You may start thinking about him less.  

Just keep going at that point; you've got an awesome future ahead of you.  You're your own person, you are independent, and you do not need this guy to be happy.  

You'll be alright :) We all come out of break ups a lot stronger and wiser than we ever were before.
