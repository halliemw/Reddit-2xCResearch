I'm on my second one. Its so wonderful for me.  I didn't bleed except once or twice during the 3 years, and it was super light and only lasted a few days (panty liner light, too light for tampons even).  My hormones are still all messed up due to having additional hormones on top of it right now though since I had been taking the pill in addition but recently quit that crap.  I have nothing but good things to say about the implant.  The only negative for me was the super bruised arm after insertion/removal.

Everyone is different though.  A lot of women sing praises for nuva ring when that made my moods out of control and was just generally miserable.
