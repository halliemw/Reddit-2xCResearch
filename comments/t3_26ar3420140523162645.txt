Getting a sleeve will hurt your chances at finding work. It will not decimate your chances, but it will restrict them. I would be unhappy if the person I were married to did something nonessential which would decrease their employment opportunity. I would be even more disappointed if that nonessential thing was something I found visually unappealing. 

This isn't going to be an equal situation because there are only two people who both want different things. It's your body and your choice, but not even acknowledging that this will justly effect your SO negatively doesn't seem loving to me.
