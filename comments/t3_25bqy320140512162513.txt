Definitely. When it first happened to me I was really shaken up. I think I was 13 or 14 and I had some vulgar catcalling done to me and I came home asking if we should call the police or something. I felt like I was violated and that it was a crime. 

But I was essentially told by teachers and parents that it wasn't a big deal. It didn't matter that I didn't feel safe it was just a sign that I was turning into a woman. I shut you not, apparently being treated that way is just a coming of age gift from the universe. /s
