As a larger lady who experiences chafing all over, I've found that some underwear are better than others.

Most recently though, I started applying arrowroot powder (in lieu of cornstarch or baby powder, which I can't stand the smell of), and it has made an enormous difference. It depends on your own body shape and needs, but it certainly works for me. Otherwise, SHORTS.
