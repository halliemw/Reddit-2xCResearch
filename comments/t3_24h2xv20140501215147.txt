I used to go to a rape crisis center for counseling when I was 15 or so. I remember it being heavily guarded by large women.You had to get buzzed in behind a few chained link fences and thoughtfully placed bamboo and vines. 

I couldn't have imagined an actual rapist working there. Especially such a young one because that would have hit far too close to home for me.

The judge just completely forgot to regard the actual victims utilizing these services.
