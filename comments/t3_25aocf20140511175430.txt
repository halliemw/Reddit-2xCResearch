Honestly, they're so different I don't think you can judge "permanent" ones based off how disposable works for you. They're an entirely different shape and size, insertion is different, removal is different, etc. I love my "permanent" cup (rainbow brand off Amazon) because it's so much smaller and easier to insert than the SoftCup. But, as always, YMMV.
