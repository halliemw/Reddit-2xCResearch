It does - it's a door that goes outside, to the side of the house. I think the only time it gets used is when I prop it open partially and stick the fan in front of it to get air circulating.

If someone opened it all the way it would hit the end of the bar, but the bar probably wouldn't go anywhere. If there was weight on it and someone slammed the door open it might hurt the door though...
