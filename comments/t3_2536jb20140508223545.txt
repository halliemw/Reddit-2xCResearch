It's just that I've been putting in so much effort that I just need to take a break from the fight if that makes sense. If it means I have to deal with a crappy psychiatrist for a bit longer, then I'm going to do it because I need some time to recharge my batteries after the shit show my doctor and therapists visits have been.
