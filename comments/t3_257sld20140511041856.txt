>Infantilized? The word has no connotations that would make such implications. 

From the wiki; "Ma'am" is more common for all adult women regardless of marital status, as "Miss" may be taken as patronizing, and it is presumptive to assume marital status based solely on apparent age."

I'm born and raised in the south and always heard that "miss" was for younger, unmarried woman and girl children. "Ma'am" was a sign of respect and was a catch-all for all women/girl children. Personally, I don't like being called miss, either.
