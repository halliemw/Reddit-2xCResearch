I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. I'm in a similar situation with my core group of girlfriends that I've known for years and live with 3 out of 4 of them. But lately I'm feeling completely left out, and I'm experiencing stuff similar to what you described. They've all gotten obsessed with rock climbing and craft beers. I'm not into those things. So, suddenly if I'm not into those things, I miss 90% of the hangouts. It blows. I feel you.
