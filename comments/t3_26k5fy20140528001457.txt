Stumbled on this thread and wanted to add basically what you are saying here. Male physician here, in radiology, son of a female radiologist. My mother only worked 2/3 time, and it was something she had to fight for. At one point her all male partners tried to axe her because she wasn't working as hard as them. I agree I don't think it's great to work 80hours a week, and a big part of the push back from that is part of this change in a historically male dominated field. 

Edit: wasn't working as hard as them meant sarcastically, should be in quotes
