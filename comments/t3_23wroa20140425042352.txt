Edit 2: Childhood crushes don't matter. Deleted because I really didn't mean to offend and was going off what I've been told by "out" friends.


Edit: Okay, apparently I hit a nerve here. I have several LGBTQ friends (I apologize if I left any out of the acronym,  that's what I hear the most) and many have said they knew since they were kids and had crushes on the same sex/both sexes (gender technically,  but I'm not close enough to people who don't identify as cisgendered - I'm on a very open, vocal campus and several people don't really hide this fact). 

So I''m misinformed,  and I'm sorry to have offended anyone by clarifying what her mom's reasoning might have been.
