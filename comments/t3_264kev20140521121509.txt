I WOULD agree... if it wasn't for the fact that my own school is nothing like the article describes - the dress code isn't in place because men "can't focus", but rather clothes they don't think are school appropriate. For instance, one rule in the dress code is female students can't show their midriff. This isn't because it's distracting to the male students, it's because it doesn't fit a school setting.

Essentially, some dress codes ban certain clothes because they aren't appropriate for a school setting, not because men might ogle a girl because of what she's wearing. Also, I'd like to point out schools ARE allowed to ban things they think inhibit any student's ability to learn. That IS what school is for, after all.
