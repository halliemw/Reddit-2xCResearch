Yup. I remember this case too, and thought the exact same thing. She agree to the contract. She agreed to a termination if the fetus had abnormalities. If she had no plan whatsoever of ever having an abortion for any reason, she should not have signed that contract. It is her own fault. Yes, it is her body but the fetus does not belong to her and she had no right over it.

I remember thinking it honestly sounded like she needed the money and just signed on to be a surrogate for the first couple that would have her. She probably didn't think about all the risks and all the possible problems (like actually having to go through with the abortion) when she signed the contract.
