If I were a mod, I would have made a brand new subreddit, very similar to 2XC except brand new. I would have made an announcement in 2XC advertising a new subreddit for educating men on female topics. After these supposed few days, the greater meaning for the creation of the sub would come to light after its default status was announced.

This way, everyone in the female default sub is there taking questions and ignorance *by choice,* and 2XC remains the haven that it should be.

Allowing 2XC to become default is a violation of trust I never would have expected from the mods here.
