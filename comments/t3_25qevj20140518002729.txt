I do not need to believe that a victim was "innocent" in order to believe in the victimization of some by others.  This doesn't require being a feminist (though I am one), it requires being aware of the world around you.

Here in the real world, we have plenty of evidence of discrimination against black people, against women, against fat people, against people who appear to be Mexican, against the poor, etc.

Pretending that it doesn't exist, by claiming that pointing out its existence is "victimhood" which is counterproductive, is bullshit.

It's an attempt not to look at the real world, by pretending that making statements about it is a weakness.

It's also another attempt to suppress the rights of those who are being victimized, by arguing that by bringing it up they are "playing the victim card" or "being weak."

And I didn't learn a damn thing from Rachel's comments, except that she hates feminists.  I'm not sure how that's supposed to be interesting.
