I understand what you're saying. I guess when I saw it a part of me wanted to hear her tell me that they're in love. I don't know, it's one of those "shock factors" that I wanted/needed to know Bryan *isn't* my dad anymore. I have a real father and have a 100x's better connection with Bryan. He was my bestfriend. I guess I just needed a kick in the gut to let him go. It was a last minute stupid decision, but I also felt bad that she had a young child that was bonding with him and wanted her to know the truth. I did it on my own accord, my mother never told me to or even hinted towards it. After I heard her confirm everything I needed to bitch him out. I was angry and seeing red and couldn't help it. I didn't want her to get the brunt of the attack so I made her act like she was sleeping. I'm at work now - came in at 330am - and i had already called his new girlfriend so I could have either called him out like I did right then and there or wait for him to wake up and talk to her then him go after my mom while I was at work.
