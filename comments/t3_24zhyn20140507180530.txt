The number one thing I would suggest is being more than just physically present in her life.  Make time for her.  Listen to her.  Be part of her life and be enthusiastic to be her father.  She wants to play outside in the creek?  AWESOME.  She wants to play with dolls?  Wonderful!  The way you treat her is going to be what she looks for in future relationships.  Be that good example for her.  My dad was there physically but I knew from an early age that he had zero interest in *me*.  Please don't make that mistake.

Good luck and have fun.  Love her to pieces every day of her life. :)
