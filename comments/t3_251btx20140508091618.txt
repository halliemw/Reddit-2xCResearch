I didn't ask for proof, because I'm ok to presume that even (for the sake of argument) a large portion consists of haters. Yet, I am new and had joined this community yesterday with my other mobile account, tried to be positive, get involved, learn and read along -- and then I'm being "lumped in" as you say.

Thanks again for the followup, and I hope you also see my side that things aren't as black and white with the newbies who arrived here.

By the way, I'm fully on your side as far as considering a big portion of Reddit being misogynist. I'm following gaming, and everytime Anita Sarkeesian is being discussed, I can't believe the immense amount of hate she and her interesting Tropes vs Women series gets on average. At the same time, I would not consider that to be general Reddit, as there's always a good portion of people (including men) cutting through the bullshit (albeit, at the expense of being downvoted into oblivion). I *do* consider it a (scarily) big portion of gaming.
