What are you even going on about.

I love Game of Thrones. I've read all the books. Twice.

That being said, it certainly seems as if lately the show writers are just throwing in rape scenes for the shock factor.

This last weeks episode had a scene with dialogue and plot development and women just being raped all willy nilly in the background. Its not necessary. It takes away from the other aspects of the scene. And even though I consider myself to have very thick skin, its getting a little bit out of hand even for me.
