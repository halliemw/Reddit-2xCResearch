I have butt length hair and I've had multiple men touch my hair without asking. The worst time was on a public bus. Guy behind me ran his fingers through my hair. Creepy as hell. I hate being touched as it is; even hugging friends and family I find it hard sometimes. Let alone a complete stranger touching me.
