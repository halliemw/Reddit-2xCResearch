Well she agreed to it. If she didnt like it, she shouldnt have taken the job.
You can sue and then settle for her not being allowed to be a surrogate, or something similar.
I still think she should give back all the money they gave her. The child's problems are not her fault, but the whole "I'll kidnap your kid and make it mine just to give it away against your will" thing definitely is. The kidnapping part might be even valid, as in illegal, don't know, I'm not in the USA.

Imagine the kid wasn't disabled and she kidnapped it... 
This is so wrong on so many levels.
