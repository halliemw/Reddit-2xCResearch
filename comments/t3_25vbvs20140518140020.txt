Either it's sour grapes or it's an honest opinion. Either way the only person who knows for sure is the person who said it and the person who is best qualified to judge what she meant on the entirety of reddit is the person who made the post.

If she wanted an honest opinion than anything other than honesty is bitchy and inconsiderate. Not being subject to the internal monologue of her friend, we can't know if the statement was frank or a dishonest attempt to manipulate. But if this person is her best friend, then *she* should know which it is from experience with that person and understanding of her friend's strengths and shortcomings.
