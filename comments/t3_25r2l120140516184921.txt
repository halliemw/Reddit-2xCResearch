I work in a similar industry and I get along really well with many of the guys because I'm quick to crack jokes and one-up them on the gross out factor, which a lot of them love. It's worked really well in networking and social areas, but it's so weird how hard it is to find other women in the office like that. I just want to talk to other bachelorette frogs! lol
