No, not overreacting. If he fired his whole team before, the issue is not that you're not cut out for the job, but that he's not cut out to lead. I don't think that it's a coincidence that he hired someone with a lack of professional experience: his old team likely called him out on his bullshit, and he hoped that someone who didn't have years of perspective would be more malleable. Well, the joke is on him!

This says nothing about you, and everything about your boss. It's likely he's a known entity for being difficult to work with, so I doubt anyone who knows him would fault you for moving on.
