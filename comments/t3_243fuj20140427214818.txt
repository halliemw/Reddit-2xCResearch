I have hardly masturbated and I am 21, too. I have always felt it to be an embarrassing thing, not something I should embrace. It's not because I was raised this way or anything, it was my own opinion of it. Even after losing my virginity, I still felt it to be embarrassing. And if I were to do it, it were to be in private. I feel like it's a deeply personal thing, not to be shared or broadcasted. I feel like this belief is so important to me that I cannot orgasm during sex. I'm not sure why. It's just something that has never happened. All of my S.O's have taken offence to it...and I wish they wouldn't. It is literally me, not them. Anyone else have this issue?
