That I had to act normal and happy even if I wasn't.

We had to dress up for church. I was told what to say and what not to say to the doctor. I was told to keep secrets because god forbid anyone learn that my family wasn't perfect. I was told I couldn't cry in front of people. I was told to always help other people, but to NEVER accept help. I was told what to say and what not to say to pretty much everybody.

Well, now I say whatever I want to if I even want to say anything.
