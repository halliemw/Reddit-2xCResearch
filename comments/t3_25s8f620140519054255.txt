True however there's an unstated expectation of fashion and entertainment going hand in hand, especially at anything approaching a "big" event. So the people who care about that stuff got upset.

The fabric was fine, it does look a bit like curtain fabric but at least pretty curtains, right? The fit wasn't the best but at least she showed waistline. I think the outfit was cute overall however it's very obvious to anyone with artistic sense that it did NOT show her in the best possible light. That said, no reason to pillory her over it. I get the sense that reporters give fashion reviews based on some kind of in-group popularity rather than actual fashion sense sometimes.
