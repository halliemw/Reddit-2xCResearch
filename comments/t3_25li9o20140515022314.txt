OP have you tried wearing a [head scarf or headband](http://jegreenberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/headbands.jpg)? Or really [awesome earrings](http://www.short-haircut.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Black-Women-Short-Blonde-Hair.jpg) that would otherwise get stuck in your hair?

I donated mine a few weeks ago, but I didn't want to shave my head, so I picked myself a short haircut.  I still got [40 cm](http://imgur.com/s4cQDFh) in length though. [Before](http://imgur.com/tV6uJtz), [After](http://imgur.com/gnjv4vz). I donated to the [Little Princess Trust](http://www.littleprincesses.org.uk/fundraising/sponsored-hair-cut/) in the UK. They take shorter lengths than the American ones, and will accept hair that has been dyed. 

If you want to donate your hair, and don't want to shave your head, it's still totally possible!
