CollegeHumor had a great video the other day about how circumcision became so common in America and my absolute favorite part was when he showed three pictures of penises one anatomically correct circumcised penis one anatomically correct uncircumcised penis and one cartoon penis.

"Ladies does this penis look weird to you"
"Yeah"
"And does this penis look weird?"
"Yeah"
"How about this penis?"
"Yeah"
"All penises look weird"
