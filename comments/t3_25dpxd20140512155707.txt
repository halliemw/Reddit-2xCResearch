I am still expecting pain but I will have my fiance there to distract me while its being put in, hopefully he can sing me a song or tell me jokes or something lol. Idk haha. But yes, I will be doing epidurals...there is no way natural childbirth is happening when I do decide to have children. No way Jose!!!
