The wonderful thing about Chell is that she was not sexualized and was largely exempt from the gamer's gaze unless you positioned your portals the right way and stood in a specific spot. I was a bit of a gamer in high school and Portal stole my heart for being a game with a strong female protagonist who wasn't overly sexualized. The fact that the game was hugely popular is a testament to the potential for the success of games with non-sexualized female protagonists, even among male audiences.
