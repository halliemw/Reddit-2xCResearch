There are a few unhelpful responses so I will reply. Its sounds pretty normal, except for the swollen labia. Mine has been relatively white for as long as I can remember. I've had paps for over a decade, no STIs, in fact, no unprotected sex in my life, and gynos and doctors have assured me its not really that unusual. While I obviously recommend you see a doctor, as this is out of the ordinary for you, I don't think you need to panic just yet. On a a side note and in regards to your pain, I do have ovarian cysts (and brutal periods) and these do cause me abdominal pain at random times in my cycle. Maybe there is some correlation to the white discharge?
