> What if the OP went to the bridal shower, and annoyed everyone there and the other guests asked the bride not to invite her to the wedding? Now the Bride either has to lie, invite her when nobody wants her there, or have an incredibly awkward conversation during a very stressful time of her life.

As I said before: if you're going to uninvite someone, have the guts to tell the person why. 

> There is just no reason to put this on the bride right now.

Or, despite your assumptions, OP actually DOES know the bride well enough to know she should be invited. Some of the people in our wedding party had invites get lost in the mail. It would be stupid for them to have to go through some convoluted chain of other people rather than just asking honestly.

Whatever the OP chooses to do, ultimately it will all be fine.
