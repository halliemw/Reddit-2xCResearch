GILMORE GIRLS without a doubt! I've never seen Felicity, but I also agree with the other suggestions of Parks and Rec, The West Wing, Buffy, and for guilty pleasures- Grey's Anatomy and Gossip Girl (Gossip Girl is seriously guilty)

I will also say that you probably won't pay much attention to them. Your baby will take up 100% of your attention, so anything on the TV will be background noise, except perhaps in the first few weeks while you're in your "lying in" period- aka recovery from massive, life producing trauma. Something without 1 million details may be best, and Gilmore Girls is light, engrossing, and really positive and girly in the best of ways.
