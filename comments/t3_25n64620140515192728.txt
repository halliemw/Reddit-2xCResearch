Echoing people saying that pregnancy is not a disability. Women have been getting pregnant and surviving for the entirety of mankind and I won't bend over backwards for anyone pregnant. Now, if they asked me politely to give up my seat and I didn't have a good reason to need the seat for myself? Then sure, I'd give it up. But no one is entitled to anything. Not to mention, automatically offering the seat is implying a sort of weakness, a NEED for the seat which she may not feel she has. I wouldn't automatically offer a seat to anyone without VERY good reason and pregnancy is not a reason to automatically need the seat. If they want it, they can politely ask for it.
