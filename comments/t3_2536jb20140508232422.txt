I've made several posts on depression on reddit. One of them is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/paeil/what_do_you_know_about_depression/). There were two others, but I can send you the links in a PM because they were removed months after I posted them, even though they were really popular (jackass mods on r/depression decided they couldn't condone resources they didn't personally vet even though several of the mods know my background and that I'm perfectly capable of vetting the resources myself and that I wasn't just posting the first links that came up on a google depression search) 

Anyway, the reason why I initially started the list was because I was with someone (who I am unfortunately still in love with after all this time) who really didn't understand the idea that depression is not on the normal scale of human emotions. It doesn't just mean the really sad end of the human emotions spectrum, it's on a plane of its own and impossible to understand for anyone who hasn't personally experienced it. I explain my story in that link I gave you of why I lost him, but I started pulling resources together to find ways to better explain to those who I need to support me but can't understand why I am the way I am. It eventually just dominoed into me wanting to read all these memoirs of others experiencing what I am experiencing but having the literary skills to express aloud what I was abstractly feeling inside, and then that progressed to realizing people with depression were often in just as much need as those who aren't in finding resources that help them understand, battle, find validation, and survive. 

Oh the things I wish I could go back and say to some doctors, who at the time I left their office in shock or feeling overwhelmed and confused, and only later realized what inappropriate, ignorant, disrespectful, bullshit I just encountered that they really needed to be called out on.
