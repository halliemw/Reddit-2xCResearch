>Generally most people into anal aren't thinking about you shitting on them and if you do it's usually traumatic enough for them to avoid anal for a long time.

Yeah, and that's my point ... anal sex is putting ones dick into an orifice intended for vacating waste from the body. I have no issue with it -- I enjoy anal, personally -- but I'm just pointing out that *as a woman who does enjoy anal*, I know for a *fact* that there are guys who won't think twice about sticking dick in the poop shoot without hesitation or even a moment to ask, "Is it clean?", but are horrified/ grossed out/ squicked by the everyday workings of the vag. They enjoy vaginal intercourse as well as anal, don't get me wrong -- they're just oddly squicked out by the vag in a way that they aren't by the anus. 

So all I'm saying is that if most guys aren't thinking about the potential of being shat on when they approach anal sex, then why does frank discussion of the vagina suddenly impede their ability to be attracted to the vagina? It doesn't compute.

>SOME MEN THINK LIKE THIS. Not me specifically. Not all men. Some men.

I know. That's why I didn't say, "all the straight men," or "every single straight man." I am married to a quite lovely man who doesn't think like this, and I also happen to have a number of male friends (and married lady friends!) who don't think like this. I'm pretty sure (although I try to avoid talking about sex with them) that my dad and brothers don't think like this. 

I'm acquainted with a great many men who don't think like this, and I never at any point tried to indicate that I believe *all* men think like this. I was specifically addressing the men who do think like this, which is what the topic of discussion is about.
