You see, this describes me to a T, but I had bad hearing until I was 7, and then was verbally abused by my family, and was also homeschooled on and off. So I have no idea if it could be this or all of that. I feel like you can have the symptoms but have many different causes. I have noticed I have been getting better socially lately, but it's something I have to work at really hard. Is there any way to know the cause for sure?

EDIT: Took this online test and it seems I'm most likely not even close to borderline. Looks like I just never had the chance to learn social skills until now. Unlucky I guess.
