Go through with the abortion.  You told him in the beginning that this was the path you would be taking if an accident happened, and it did, he is going to have to deal with your decision.  Obviously he isn't thrilled, but he is going to have to deal with it regardless. That being said, if he can't be with you anymore because of this you need to accept that - that is his choice, not yours. You both have some choices to make here, but make *yours* for *you*, and let him make *his* for *him*.
