That's what really pissed me off about it. I just wanted to be ignored and was dressed as frumpy as I possibly could have been at the time. I also wear my wedding band/engagement ring 24/7 and up until now it's done a pretty good job of helping me towards the goal of being invisible to creepers. Ugh.
