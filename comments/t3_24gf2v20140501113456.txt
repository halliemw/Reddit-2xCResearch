I just want to thank everyone for the words of support. I replied to the top comment but also want to mention here that I think posting here and seeing the comments was the kick I needed to start the process of seeking professional guidance. I just reached out to the wonderful woman who lead the post-partum group I attended when my son was born. She's a counselor and works with women who are dealing with pregnancy related depression and anxiety as well as birth trauma, both of which I believe I need help with. Thanks again! Hopefully the cloud of fear and insecurity I'm currently living under will lift soon.
