Seriously!  My mom works at a company that hires a ton of Chinese and Vietnamese women.  None of them are delicate, submissive flowers.  If anything, HR/management has to tell them how to be a little less aggressive and direct when you work in a Midwestern US company, where people tend to be pretty low-key.  And my sister married a half-Korean guy, and I would *not* qualify any of his female Korean relatives as "shy" by ANY stretch of the imagination.

I feel like this is not only a silly stereotype, but a rather dated one.  It's easy to assume women in some faraway place you've only experienced via media are somehow vastly different than the women around you who have been "spoiled by feminism" (into thinking they can have a better life than basically being a wageless servant to a man who doesn't appreciate them very much!).  And, granted, women who make it into a different country on the far side of the world and get a job are self-selecting to be a bit more confident and outgoing.  But nonetheless, I have never found any Asian women to be the shy, submissive creatures that some creepers seem to expect.

As a white girl, I tend to be a bit suspicious of a guy who mentions a preference for Asians, because so often it's shorthand for "I believe in gender inequality, and care little to nothing for you as an individual" (or, sometimes, "my understanding of women is largely based on anime").  I don't make it a "dealbreaker" but it would affect what questions I asked off the bat.
