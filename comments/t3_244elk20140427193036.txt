I've had people flip out because I'm 20 and have only kissed two guys (and one of them, I am kind of taking back because he doesn't deserve it).

Sometimes people come off as virgin shaming (like how my mom thinks I need that to keep my SO interested) or thinking somebody is prudish because they haven't found the right person.

I don't care as much about past partners than I care about the respect they gave to them. If somebody had only one partner, but abused them, I wouldn't date them.
