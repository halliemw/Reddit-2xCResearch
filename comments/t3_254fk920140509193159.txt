Agreed. I'm surprised your getting so many down-votes for this opinion. Maybe it's all the newbies? [Ms. Magazine](https://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/11/20/goldieblox-ad-perpetuates-the-fallacy-of-the-pink/) is of the same opinion.  

There is nothing wrong with pink or things that are traditionally considered "girly".

However, we should be careful not to send the message that girls are only meant to use pink things with bows on them. 

The commercials market themselves as defying the pink princess stereotype, yet that's the same stereotype they are promoting with all their products. 

The whole pink=girls idea really needs to be examined. 

Pink really represents social concept of 'girl' that is strongly limiting, reinforces stereotypes and has further ramifications. Pink has become the signpost for all things girl. From an increasingly young age, children are being funnelled into identifying with toys, games and other products, which separate them and narrow their range of play and experience.
