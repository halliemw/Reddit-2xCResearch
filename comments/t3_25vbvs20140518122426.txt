Wow. I was expecting something cringe-worthy. That dress is *beautiful*. Seriously, I'm not just trying to make you feel better.

 She might actually not like it -- but you might just have different tastes! People like different things. *I* like it, if that's what you want to know. What's important is that you like the dress you're wearing! It's *your* special day, after all.

On the other hand, be happy that your best friend can be so honest with you! I'm sure it was difficult for her to say. 

But yeah, you look gorgeous. Don't let other peoples' opinions get you down!
