I've always rather thought that too.  Why reward someone who (in my opinion) is wasting everyone's time by asking for something that he clearly should know he doesn't have the criteria/experience for?  That's something that should be chastised, not rewarded.  We shouldn't be putting up with that behavior from anyone, and we certainly shouldn't be encouraging anyone to *start* doing it.
