I'm not in the US and no, they don't have changing tables in the men's bathroom from what my boyfriend tells me here either.

But in the mall near my house there aren't any changing tables in the men's bathroom nor in the women's. There's a small room with two changing tables that any parent (regardless of gender) can access to change their kid's diaper in.
