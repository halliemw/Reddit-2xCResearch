No problem, will update the post!

**UPDATE:** Spoke to an RN and a specialist at my docs. RN was concerned that my sharp pain and nausea didn't sound normal and put me in touch with specialist. 

They both wanted to get me in to see an MD as soon as possible, they said it's possible it perforated during insertion and/or that my body is getting used to the new hormones/going off my old BC.

Unfortunately I'm traveling for work and the timing is bad, so I'm going to go see someone when I get in. But specialist said if anything gets worse to go to ER. I woke up this morning thinking I felt fine, but sure enough like clockwork if I don't take ibuprofen, the sharp pain from my tailbone up my spine and nausea sets in.

Specialist agreed there's not much they can do until the physically examine me then possibly ultrasound me. Fingers crossed that I just might need stronger pain meds for a week or so and that everything is fine.
