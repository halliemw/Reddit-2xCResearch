I'm not surprised they don't teach about uterine abnormalities. 

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_malformation#Types 

Having one of these 6 abnormalities is pretty rare let alone having no vagina at. Most doctors won't know what you're talking about. Warning do not google these. It leads to a lot of sadness.
