I'm a mid 20's male feminist sociology major, I think the problem right now in western society is that media, politicians, anywhere that's public space is still influenced by traditions that have been around since the 50's. As much as women do have far more rights than they used to, they are still victims of all kinds of social stigmas. Like "women cant be labourer's because its hard work" etc. 

Also I think that few people are truly educated in gender equality, especially men, unless they have suffered some form of discrimination. You should hear some of the arguments put forward in my gender class, Its mind boggling, to be in such a progressive society but still have such backwards traditionalist values.

In summary, i think these people on Tumblr and similar sites, are just trying to raise awareness in their own way, in the most successful platform we have available.
