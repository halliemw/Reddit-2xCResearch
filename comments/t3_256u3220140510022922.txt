I've had both. the mirena and now currently the paraguard IUD. both insertions were pretty uncomfortable and the days after were crampy like a bad period, but after a couple days I was back to normal and then nothing else. The insertion process is annoying and a little painful but it's seriously the only shitty part you have to deal with for five or ten YEARS. 

For me the insertions werent even that bad. it was a weird sensation considering I've never had anything inserted in my cervix before and since but nothing awful. 

I think the internet definitely brings out the horror stories, but do take into account that for the vast majority of women who have had this procedure, it's been nothing but good experiences.
