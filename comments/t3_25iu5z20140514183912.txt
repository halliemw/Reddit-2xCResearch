soooo difficult ah but it should be fun, wherever it chances. 

Yeah, I was feeling pretty good about myself, both body image and confidence in myself as a person, actually the couple of weeks before, so when I realized I felt lonely deep down, that something was missing, was really strange to me. But it's just a minor setback I suppose. It'll be okay
