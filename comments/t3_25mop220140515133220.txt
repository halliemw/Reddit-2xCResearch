he sounds depressed for sure. it might be something where he just needs to talk to the right person to help him unwind his thoughts. like a clinic psychologist. we all go through it. 

the next thing to look at would be biological imbalances. depression can be caused be acute situations and circumstances but there may be something more going on deeper. depression can be caused by nutritional deficiencies which can lead to hormone problems. he should also have his thyroid checked out. 

tell him to relaxe, see someone he can talk to, clean up his diet, take some good supps, and get good sleep. after about 6-8 weeks if there is no change i would pursue it medically.
