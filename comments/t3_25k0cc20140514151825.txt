I don't really "follow" anything. I've just been making an effort to eat lower carb and lower calorie foods and higher protein since I have been upping my workouts and trying to slim down a bit. Since I'm not super strict, I don't ALWAYS eat the best foods, but I have already lost some weight and have had more energy, so it's been working!
