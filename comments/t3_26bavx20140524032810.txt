I get what you're saying, but let me tell you that anyone who is even remotely educated on sexual assault and the effects it has on people would tell you that putting the burden on someone who was sexually abused to come forward so he/she doesn't abuse another victim is absolutely, unequivocally a *terrible* thing to do.

Not only is that person scarred, afraid, and likely going to be ostracized by the friends of this "great" guy, but the guilt of such a burden is grossly unjust. 

She's already been victimized in a horrible way. How dare you victimize her again. 

It's not up to those raped to teach men how not to rape and to suggest it is, is just abhorrent.
