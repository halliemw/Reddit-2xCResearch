Yeah, actually, we got the safe sex talk but only in reference to heterosexual PIV sex. I didn't even know that STD's can be transferred through lesbian sex for a very long time. Hopefully this is something that school systems will work to reform with the coming changes in society. Abstinence education overall has been proven to be ineffective time and time again. The truth is, most people like having sex. Might as well teach them how to do it properly and safely instead of shaming them about it.
