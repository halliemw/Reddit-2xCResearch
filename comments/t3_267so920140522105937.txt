It's totally normal and natural to have a little bit of a pooch. As for the bloating, there are a few ways to try to see what's causing it. This sort of symptom is generally caused by an intolerance rather than an allergy, and as far as I know there aren't usually good tests for intolerances. You can try cutting out different common irritants like lactose for a few weeks and seeing if it goes away, or you can try to pinpoint it by documenting what you eat every day and when you have bad bloating and looking for any patterns, then trying to cut out whatever you think might be causing it. I'd also recommend documenting your menstrual cycle and the bloating together to see if it's associated with that. I know I bloat more and have different digestive issues at different points in my cycle, and it's really not all that uncommon. Once you have some data on all of it, then take it to your doctor and see what they think.
