The first time I ever drove a car, used chopsticks, kissed, danced, sang in public, dove off the high dive, went to a concert, played an instrument, or tried to train my dog all I could think of was "am I doing this right?"   In every situation, I had someone supportive there with me telling me that I could do it.

Sex was the same thing. 

It was a new life experience. So much of my mind is concerned with whether I do things right. Because I had someone there with me ( my partner) who I loved, and as he was very supportive, the situation was much better. I didn't feel anxious all.  I allowed myself to have fun.


So, I'm not saying you should wait until you're married to the person. I'm just saying you should wait until you know for sure that the person is supportive and loving. When you're 100 years old will you look back and go "ughhhh facepalm"?  If so, maybe this isn't right person or the right time.  But, if you can say "I'm glad I did that" ... go for it
