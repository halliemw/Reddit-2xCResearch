This reduces the ability for people to downvote links as easily, but that applies to *all* links.

If we remove the downvote arrow you'll just see people posting redpill and MRA links to the subreddit and upvoting them en-masse instead, because the community won't have the ability to downvote them.

Sadly there's no easy answer to people who are determined to disrupt a subreddit, and thoughtless/knee-jerk reactions like "remove all downvotes" often end up being worse than the problem they purport to fix.
