Oh hey another throw away probably from the same person! I'm flattered. 

My mother is my bestfriend and I'm hers and when she told me Bryan wanted us out I didn't believe her. I didn't believe the man that I had been calling my father would do something so terrible. Especially with him still sleeping with her, crying over her, etc. She saw the text messages and showed me. It was exactly what I needed to see to know it was really over. I'm 20 for fuck sake, i'm not a small child that you can't swear in front of. This is a life changing event, how else is she going to tell me? "Hey Kels, out of no where we need to move out and not talk to Bryan anymore. I'd elaborate but i'm too good of a parent to let you know why i'm flipping your world upside down. Start packing!" 

Bryan still loves me a lot, he blew up my phone telling me i'll always be his daughter and he will always love me but that he couldn't be with my mom anymore. If I do something he doesn't take it as harshly as if it was my mother doing it because it's his daughter being upset with him, not an ex lover getting mad and jealous. It's two totally different things. 

If I wanted a huge story that would get a lot of attention and sympathy then I would have **made something up** instead of being honest and sharing what a shit show my llife has turned into in the last few hours.
