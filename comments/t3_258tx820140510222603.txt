Connie Willis is a great writer of sci-fi.  She's very good at intersecting plot and dialog with the machinations of science fiction.  It makes for great reading.  Doomsday Book is definitely one of my favorite time travel novels, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good history/scifi read.
