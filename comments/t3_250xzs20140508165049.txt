Opinionated?  Do you understand that the point of reddit is to communicate ideas, perspectives, and opinions?

Angry?  It seems that if anyone disagrees with you, you label them as "angry" and "dramatic" to shift the focus off of your shitty attitude.  Classic derailing so you don't have to deal with a logical, dissenting response to your comment.  In fact, we're not even talking about the original topic at hand and instead are talking about my attitude and tone.  I assume this is because you have no idea what you are talking about or have so little reason to back up your opinion that you don't want anyone to think about it anymore.
