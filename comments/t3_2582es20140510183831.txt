Heavy periods, lightheadedness and vision that's going black? I had some similar symptoms before, and I was diagnosed with anemia. **Please please please see a doctor, OP.** If you're having a 6-week heavy heavy period, your body's not able to keep up. You gotta switch pills while you're at it. I had dizzy spells while sitting down at my old job as well and it baffled my doctors for months till an urgent care clinic is like "lol no wonder you're dizzy so much, you're anemic"

Best solution while recovering, eat ALL the steaks, unless you're vegetarian/vegan, then eat ALL the broccolis. Then make beef and broccoli stir fry, cause that's da bomb-diggity.
