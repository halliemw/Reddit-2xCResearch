YES!!! OMG I thought I was the only one who noticed.  

Being a female programmer, I run into that stereotype all the time.  People think I'm the project manager or the intern and not the lead developer who has been programming for over 12 years.  They're shocked to find out I have a masters degree and that I really do know what I'm talking about when I talk tech.  

I've learned to accept it and work hard to improve my leadership abilities.  But it is disheartening to see that sort of portrayal on TV or in other popular media.  

I was really liking that show, but now I'm less enthusiastic about watching it.
