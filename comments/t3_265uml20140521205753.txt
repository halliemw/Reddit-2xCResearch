I am surprised how many people just post cliche advice without considering the situation.

Her husband literally believes that a fetus is morally equivalent to a living child. If she tells him about planning an abortion, his reaction will be similar to if she told him she was planning to kill their four year old. This will destroy their marriage. Yet so many people posters are saying she should tell him the truth because that will be best for her marriage.

If she wants to stay married, she should lie and keep lying until her or her husband is in the grave. Tell nobody the truth.

If she thinks truth is that important to a marriage, then she needs to prepare for a divorce, because her relationship isn't going to survive this.
