Oh without a doubt, I by no means wish to tar all men, or even all 'nerdy' men with the same brush. That's the kind of shit I've been against my whole life. I know personally how hard it is to try your absolute best and still be rejected again and again. And I too internalize it and loath myself, because I'm often in the mind set that if someone doesn't like me there obviously must be something wrong with me. But I also know you can't force attraction. I can't see how you can be so angry with someone or multiple someone's for simply not wanting to have sex with you. That's their right and their choice and the only thing left to do is improve upon yourself and move on.
