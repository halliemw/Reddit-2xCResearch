>Shaming people for enjoying pornography is slut shaming.

Criticising a work of art is not the same thing as criticising its fans. I've not seen Game of Thrones, though from what I've read it's not outright pornography, but drama with an erotic element ie it has a purpose other than merely to arouse. Depicting a rape scene in an erotic manner, as something pleasurable, within the context of an otherwise serious drama would be, to say the least, problematic.
