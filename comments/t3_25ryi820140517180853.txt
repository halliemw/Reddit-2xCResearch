Especially in cases like this, where a band trying to do the right thing is making a music video, I'm sure a well-informed or experienced actor could recommend some adjustments to make it better. You make it out as if actors have no agency in the matter when I've heard countless stories to the contrary, from things as small as music videos to as large as movies.
