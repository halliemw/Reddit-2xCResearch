how in the world from simply the description above can you say "that's not depression."...even if you were a mental health professional. As someone whose friend and mentor killed himself on Sunday, I find this incredibly presumptuous. Noone had any idea, not even his wife. I don't know much about depression, but he could very well be depressed. TO OP: I'd say the best route would be to simply talk to Jake and tell him how you feel. Ask him how he feels. Refrain from saying "how you used to be" and refrain from any criticism. That will make things worse. Tell him why you love him, and don't use the past tense about why you fell in love with him. He's still the same guy. Secondly, read this book TOGETHER:
