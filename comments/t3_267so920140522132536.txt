I think I'll try the probiotics for a week or two and if there's no change then I'll start to cut things out, starting with dairy. I don't consume much wheat, so I don't think it's that, but I have at least a little bit of dairy a day whether it's milk, smoothies or something that just generally contains some kind of dairy product. 

Thanks for the advice, it helps. I'll see how I get on after taking my probiotics for a couple weeks. Might as well see if it's a bacterial/digestive issue first!
