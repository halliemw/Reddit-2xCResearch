Meetup.com is a great way to meet new friends. There are groups for pretty much any hobby or just to go out and meet people including just girl nights. I went through this after a break up where I really had no friends, and the best thing ever was learning to go out to dinner or a drink by myself. I really loved the freedom and confidence I gained learning to go out by myself, and starting conversations with strangers. Fast forward, after having my first child I felt lonely and bored stuck in the house and no friends with kids,I went on meetup and found a ton of mom groups and from there made some real friends. People are on there for the same reason, to make friends who otherwise have a hard time doing so. There are groups for all age groups and you can always start your own. Good luck!
