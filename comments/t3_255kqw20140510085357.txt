I guess I don't understand why two separate people are trying to convince me that I should put my ass on a urine-soaked toilet seat? And are snarky about it too, as if it is self-evident that I shouldn't care about exposing myself to the ass germs of untold numbers of strangers. Even if it won't kill me, why is that a thing I should have no problem at all doing? Does that sound pleasant to you? Maybe it's just that I live in NYC, but I'll never stop feathering the nest.
