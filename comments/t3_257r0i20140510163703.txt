When we got the implants, my sister stopped having her periods altogether and mine became extremely long and sometimes ran together. Complete opposites. It's luck of the draw. Personally, it's worth the inconvenience to me. My husband does not care (we're grown-ass adults, after all), and my periods aren't really that bad to me. Having the most effective form of birth control out there that I don't have to think about but once every three years? I deal with the tradeoff. I can see how others can't and have it removed though.
