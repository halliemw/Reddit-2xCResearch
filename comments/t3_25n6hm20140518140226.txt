As a second opinion to explain why your comment is getting a bad reaction, I thought your comment and was fine, and I agreed with it until the last sentence. The only thing that put me off was that you said people should feel sorry/pity for harassers, and that's an unhelpful response that is given a lot. It may help some people, but it's not nice to hear for others. People who harass others don't deserve people's sympathy. Whether it's out of ignorance or malice, it's incorrect behavior and they should be shamed for it. I'm sure some guys do harass out of ignorance, but it's still not okay, and nobody should feel sorry for people who hurt others.
