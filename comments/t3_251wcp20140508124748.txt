> Could it be that the default subreddits are catered more towards men's interests? 

I don't think so. Not in general at least. What annoys me with subreddits like funny, videos, pics etc is the huge amount of non-interesting random pictures/videos of supposedly hot women. No, I have nothing against beautiful women but I'm not particularly interested in bouncy boobs or bubbly butts. So I seldom go to those subreddits and many hetero women seem to feel the same.  Other than that... who doesn't love cute kittens or the like?

Also, when I browse non-xx subreddits I tend to use a different account with a gender neutral name and never mention that I am, in fact, a woman. I do this to avoid all gonewild comments, tits or GTFO, assessment of my hypothetical attractiveness (if they disagree with me, especially on topics with gender/ethnicity,  I *must* be ugly!) etc.

> Or is it that women don't see such forums like reddit as attractive and would prefer to browse websites that cater towards their specific interests? 

I'm a little older than many on reddit and my feeling is that most women in my age group aren't that into random internet things. Many don't use facebook even though its very mainstream. Many are so busy they don't have that extra time to randomly browse the internet / they prioritize something else (which often is volunteering, exercising, being with family/friends, doing projects like gardening, painting, playing in a band/orchestra) etc.
