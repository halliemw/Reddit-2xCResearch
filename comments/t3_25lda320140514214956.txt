Your face is your face and I think the best thing you can do is learn to love it! It's not easy but you can do it! Remember, you are your own worst critic. I used to absolutely loathe my appearance, I couldn't bear to look in a mirror, I would feel embarrassed when people looked at me. I still don't really feel pretty but I'm getting there and I do believe my OH when he tells me I am and his opinion is the only one that matters to me.  

You can experiment with makeup (makeup has really boosted my confidence. It's like an artform that allows me to express myself) and change your hair and get new glasses. These can all help you feel prettier.  
  
Focus on parts of your face that you do like! Or if you can't pick something that you do like start by focusing on your husband's favourite parts. Maybe you have really beautiful eyes or a great smile. Play them up! Maybe try a nice mascara or some lip products. Take selfies, take photos of you and your husband together!  

Just be kind to yourself.
