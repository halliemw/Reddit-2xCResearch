I agree, I shouldn't call him creepy even if I was uncomfortable. Now that I've had time to calm down and not analyze everything too much, I see that maybe he was just trying to make connections in the same way I'm trying to meet new people elsewhere. And just this time, he didn't come across well... He didn't hurt me, I'm just scared that I'll do the same thing when I meet someone else who doesn't have good intentions. Thank you so much for your response!
