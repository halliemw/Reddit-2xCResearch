I swear you are perfect. You dealt with that idiot so well and you rock the short hair. Im 15 and lateish last year I cut most of my hair off, it was tough and scary but it's been around 6 months and I don't regret it. I actually got half of my hair even shorter just last week. I've never felt this pretty and comfortable in who I am.

You are gorgeous and lovely.
