And the fact that there are more men pitching than women means nothing? How are 'all-male' teams formed - is it just guys hanging out with their friends, or are they actively excluding women? And are the 'all-male' teams producing objectively better concepts than the others?

These statistics are meaningless without further insight. That being said, it's probably true that you're at a disadvantage unless you're a white male (like the fake pitch in the article talks about). But how do you uncondition society to trust an immigrant, or a woman, or an Arab, or someone who's just not that good-looking, just as much as a handsome white male?
