I think as long as you are polite and don't just ask questions to troll (like pestering a person who is in obvious distress) then you should be ok. If you really want debate, try r/feminism. A lot of people are unhappy that this sub is a default now, so you might get some bad reactions from some people, but I think as long as you are generally nice and agreeable you should be ok.
