This is a very complicated question. Personally, I would recommend couples counseling. A lot of responses are jumping to abortion and ditching the guy, and they may not be wrong. However, if you value the relationship as much as you say you do counseling may help you stand back and reflect on the situation. You should probably try to set it up soon considering the time constraints. 

Good luck.
