Don't fix it if it ain't broke.  People with insecurities achieve the greatest things in life.  If you "fix" him you might destroy what he might achieve and become.

If you don't like it, find somebody else.  Find the "asshole" or "jerk" that all the girls want to bang.  But don't stop somebody who has an emotional drive and purpose in life.
