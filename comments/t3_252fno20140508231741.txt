I really understand what ladies mean when they say they don't want a male perspective on women's issues. I get it. I do. However I really wish the word "mansplaining" would go die in a fire. It's dismissive and counterproductive. Do to the fact that it's gender specific I'd even go as far as to say it's a sexist word, it sounds like it applies to all men explaining *anything*. I understand what "mansplaining" really is and yes it is shitty, irritating, and sexist, but I don't really think the word used to describe it is any better. 

I'm prepared for the downvote brigade, but I felt strongly compelled to express my feelings on the word "mansplaining".
