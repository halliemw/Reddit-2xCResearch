It's a little of both. Birth control doesn't really change your metabolism or anything, but some are very well known for increasing appetite, like Depo. So you end up gaining weight, but not without eating more in general. So birth control doesn't make it difficult to lose weight or cause weight gain directly, but it's not terribly uncommon to gain some weight while on birth control because you want to eat more.
