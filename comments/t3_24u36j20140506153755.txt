I think so. I will say that I find the constant bombardment with this glamorized ideal of youth annoying at best. I'm in my twenties now, and I'm pretty sure these aren't the best years of my life. I'm perpetually broke, I'm in grad school for forever, health insurance is going to be a fortune when I have to get it myself, and I'm kind of in relationship limbo right now because we've been dating for 4 years but neither of us wants to get married when I'm still in school and he still has professional exams to take and some of my family members (my dad's side, where everyone is conservative and everyone married very young) threatened to disown me if I lived with him before marriage, so it sucks and it's going to suck for a while. I hate being told that I'm supposed to love my life now, because my life now is all just building up to my thirties. I mean, I enjoy my life for the most part, but it's stressful and I hate being told all about how these are supposed to be the best years of my life. I'm looking forward to my thirties so much at this point.
