Plan B is about $35 and it needs to be taken as soon as possible. Preferably within 24 hours but less efficacy in 72. Do not wait. It's better to use a credit card now and pay it off in a day than play around with potentially getting pregnant. I hope since you posted you bought Plan B for your sake.
