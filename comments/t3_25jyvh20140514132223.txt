Have you considered seeing a doctor, or getting some mental health help? Have you been abused in the past? Coming from a background of abuse / mental health issues, I can understand getting extremely angry, or even feeling like you want to hurt someone or something.

I would consider looking in to it. You would be amazed how much even just vocal therapy can take a load off your shoulders.
