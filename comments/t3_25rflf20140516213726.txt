No frownies! :) Sexual attraction is healthy and unavoidable and really really lovely (there are some lovely men and women in the world). If he hasn't expressed any other desires, he's not going to get them fulfilled. The primary question to ask is "Why do you want  me to look "hot" all the time?" Hot isn't really our primary goal when getting dressed every day. If he's trying to make you fit a look or image he wants, he needs to stop trying to dictate who you are. There is also a bit of an age gap (I'm assuming you're in different places right now in life?) and it may be some insecurity on his part, in which case he needs to accept who you are now. But, if it turns out to be a bit of a heretofore untold kink, then you can indulge it at times and he can save his opinions for then.
