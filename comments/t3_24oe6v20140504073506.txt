I have this quandary. I have a PhD in particle physics but am currently a stay at home mum. I would like to have another child and stay at home full time until both are in school.

 I would find it incredibly difficult to maintain a full time career and spend quality time with my family. Most jobs that would interest me wouldn't have me home until about 7pm which would be bath and bed time so in effect I'd be a weekend mum which is something I'm not really prepared to accept. (I'm happy to outsource or just becoming sloppy all other house hold tasks apart from daily quality bonding time with my kids)

On the other hand I definitely miss the intellectual challenge of work. I've recently started doing tutoring and it's just made a huge difference to be using my brain and to have a purpose outside of the house. 

Ideally I'd love to find some kind of middle ground where I could have a less intensive career (working say 8am - 3/4pm) which would allow me to be home with my kids after school but in reality this doesn't seem to exist. Once as a couple you start focusing on one person's career it's hard to readdress the balance; my husband's offered to take his turn as a stay at home dad but that wouldn't make sense financially because his career's already off the ground. 

In the end something has to give and it looks like it will be my career which I see as a necessary sacrifice.
