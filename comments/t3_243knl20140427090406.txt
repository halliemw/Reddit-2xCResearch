I feel ya! I did the online thing for a few years. I went on some dates, met new people. While most of the guys were very nice, we just didn't have that spark to make it past a couple dates. Plus I stood my ground and didn't let anyone in my pants till we were officially monogamous. That meant I didn't sleep with a single guy I met online. Finally I got fed up and deleted my account. I focused on work and friends. Eventually a friend of mine posted on Facebook asking if any girls were interested in dating a cute and nerdy guy. I responded and that's when he introduced me to my current guy I am very much in love with. I hated people saying "it will happen when you least expect it" while I was single. For me it was true. 


My advice on meeting new people is step out of your norm. Try new activities. Take a cooking class, join a coed softball team, just try things you have always wanted to try. What helped me was to say yes when I would usually say no. If a group from work wanted to go to happy hour but I was tired or wanted to go home and watch tv, I would say yes and force myself to go to meet new people and try new things. That's why I had the tenacity to say "yes" and respond to that Facebook post. It was out of the norm for me. Best of luck and just have fun doing your own thing! It will happen when you least expect it. ;)
