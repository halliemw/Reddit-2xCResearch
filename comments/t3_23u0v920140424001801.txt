To be safe, I would just not let his penis *anywhere* near your vulva until the pill kicks back in. I'm in that exact same situation, actually, and I'm just abstaining from that sort of sex for the next few weeks. Don't take the morning after pill unless you've legitimately had accidental unsafe sex, it's way crazy on your body. It's basically like taking a bunch of regular bc pills at once, which is apparently quite unpleasant, and you should try to avoid it as much as possible (unless you actually need it, of course).
