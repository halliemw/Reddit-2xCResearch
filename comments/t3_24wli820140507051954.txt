Yes, grain of salt is good. Perhaps their social media team is operating under the "any publicity is good publicity" scheme-  It's clear from here that a lot of people who previously hadn't heard of black milk before, do now.  I personally don't think that it is a very good approach to post what they did, and then react to their fans by saying their personal opinions didn't matter, not even apologizing for any offense, and basically telling everyone who had a problem with them to F off.  Although this is all just drama, it makes me suspicious about companies that are willing to publicly treat their fans this way-- how rudely would they treat a paying customer who had a problem with their product then? Probably not very well, if this is their attitude.
