Like other people have mentioned, I think nutrition is a great thing to talk about, because girls that she are mostly getting bad information from their friends or their older sisters (or their well-meaning mothers, who are *also* getting bad information.)

Break it down to basics: what is a calorie? What is a carbohydrate? Why is it that eating *only* five servings of fruits and vegetables a day is not a good idea, even if they're supposed to be healthy? That sort of thing. I would also mention anemia if you get the chance because it's devastatingly common in young women and it's not mentioned nearly enough.

Other things... Women in STEM, maybe? I remember having female chemists and engineers come in to talk to my grade 7 class which I really appreciated.
