First of all, how lovely to make such a contrived example. But let's go with it! 
I dunno, you're telling me you wouldn't notice if someone you're having sex with is suddenly still, unresponsive and sitting there like you're giving her a gynecologist check up? Not noticing someone not moan and tense up tight and breathe like they are grinning and bearing a root canal? If you noticr something is off, you wouldn't immediately stop and ask "are you ok?" Not because you might even think she feels raped but fuck, shit happens and people suddenly feel sick or nauseated or dizzy or have an emotional break down and remember their dog died or whatever the fuck. This stuff happens sometimes during sex and by far decent people notice something is up and stop and re-check for consent. 

Are people so freaking unaware or not paying attention to cues to notice someone is seriously not enjoying themselves? **The whole point if sex is ongoing feedback.** If the positive feedback stops why the fuck would you continue having sex? You're suppose to enjoy yourself and at the same time try and do stuff so the other person enjoys herself too. It's basically absurd to suggest someone can fuck an unresponsive living corpse and assume it's consensual, fetishes aside.


I literally am appalled that you think one can confuse someone who is frozen up by fear with an enthusiastic, positive moaning, grabbing herself and you horny woman who wants it. Really, man? And if the girl is shy and you can't read her non verbal cues, by far the most common and decent thing to do is to ask verbally. If someone is inexperienced and shy and frozen by apprehension, like perhaps a virgin, it is entirely **common fucking sense** to go slow and to **repeatedly** ask "is this ok?" "Is this uncomfortable" " is this better". 


So is it a lot different? No it's fucking not. You're trying to put the burden of rape on the victim go signal and portray rapists as clueless bumbling but innocent idiots who just assumed since 9 signals were given than it's right too ahead. **there is no all clear go ahead**. Just because you took a girl home and she made out with you does bot give you all clear to assume consent all the way to your ejaculation. It's your responsibility as a human being to pay attention to the other person. And if something is off, then **stop**, don't assume ok. 

Why? Because non rapists are aware that they are relying on implied consent and if it gets unclear it's your responsibility to make sure the consent is still there. 

I have had my SO realize something is wrong when I had a cramp in my leg and I was pretending it away not wanting to ruin the flow. **he still fucking noticed because he was aware of me**. This is normal and expected. A lot of sex can end up with sitting on someone's hair, or indadvertedly kicking them in the ribs with an elbow, or positioning yourself in a way that hurts the man's or the woman's genitals or a million other things. It's integral to thr act to pay attention to what you are doing. If you are not and you fuck a frozen in fear person you are not excused from the rape. You are guilty of noy paging attention to the consent
