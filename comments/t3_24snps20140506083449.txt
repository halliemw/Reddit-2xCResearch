I think it's really cool to break the standards :) I actually worked at J Crew for a while and part of the reason my manager was excited to have me there was that I made it look accessible to another group of people. (I had black joan jett hair at the time.) I've had more compliments when my hair was bright (pink or red or blond with streaks) than any other time - and primarily from older ladies, which I love! They understand that its fun and happy - and I think some of them wish they'd had an opportunity to express themselves freely also.

Btw a top hat is on my wish-list :) I have baby ones, cause we do steampunky stuff but I want a full size one as well!

If you wanna share hair - DM me?  I'm so intrigued!
