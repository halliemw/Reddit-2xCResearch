I think they were just trying to be friendly and compliment you but it just came out poorly. I do not think he was trying to be mean or anything. I understand that it doesn't feel good though. 

I can relate. I have never been medically overweight or even near the upper end of it but  I went through a bout of depression that led to me losing about 20 pounds recently. Parents were so happy and said how I looked so healthy. Because living on hot dogs, ice cream, and candy is healthy. Unfortunately people do not always realize the implications of what they say.
