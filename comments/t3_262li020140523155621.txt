I think it's quite unrealistic to believe that no teenagers should worry themselves about life issues. At this point, we should be learning about the world and creating our stances on it's situations. I know that the dress code is not targeting me personally, but I do hold that it's negative effects are worth fighting against. I'm not claiming to be sage, or that I know better than anyone, but I have had some life experience and I have opinions that I care strongly about.
