I see where you're coming from, it happened really fast so there wasn't really much time to consider everything. I'm just glad that she is making a first step of getting out there, even if it doesn't work out. I know what you mean about the real self thing, she does tend to water herself down when she is shy. But the date is tomorrow...you don't think she should cancel do you? I know she is excited for it, nervous, but excited. 

I am trying to think of a hobby that she likes to do, but the problem is that she has neuropathy in her hands and fingers from chemotherapy and bad vision, so it limits her. Before all her health problems, she liked to draw, paint, garden, sew... But most of those you can do by yourself. She is very creative. 

 Do you have any ideas? I think a hobby that involves interaction with people is a good idea. Just hopefully nothing that could be too "cliquish", she lives in a senior apartment due to her health and has said there are a lot of cliques there and i've seen it.
