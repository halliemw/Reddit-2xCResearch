Just survived a year long LDR, now we live together!  

1) text, skype, imessage, facebook messages and posts, Reddit together, whatever.  COMMUNICATE

2) care packages on holidays/birthdays/random fun times make a big difference!  I once was in a run down junk shop in Michigan and bought a little decorative spoon with a lobster on it and a little tippy bird, then walked across the street to the post office to stuff it all in an envelope for my SO.  It's the little things that tell someone else you're thinking of them.  

3) r/longdistance


Good luck!!
