I was ALWAYS paranoid of this! I swear, I was taking a pregnancy test every other month for a while (of course, with this one I actually ignored the signs for a week haha). I'm glad to hear about 2 healthy IDU pregnancies! Do you know if they gave her any special instructions with them? It's so early in my pregnancy, my doctor didn't have any tips or advice except to "wait and hope for the best", but I'm scared to even move for fear of hurting my baby :(
