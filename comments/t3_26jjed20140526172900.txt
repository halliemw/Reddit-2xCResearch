I use the wind-chimes thing for the ground-level window in my house (it's on a slope, so only one of the windows is that low) and I can tell you that it's a great idea and works wonderfully!  I mainly use it for keeping the stray cats from coming inside, and I've caught one kitty in particular trying to sneak in TWICE!  Both times, I heard the chimes and ran in to the window to see this cat halfway in staring at me!  LOL.  It would work well as a cheap burglar alarm too.  

Separate story-  A few years ago I lived in a building which was not in a great neighborhood, but the building itself seemed secure enough.  One night while I was asleep someone actually picked the lock on my small studio apartment and tried to come in!  It was absolutely terrifying, and I don't know what I would have done if it hadn't been for my dog.  She's super paranoid, and was already at the door when the guy went to push it open, at which point her very loud barking and growling woke me up just in time to see the guy slam the door back shut before (or maybe after, I don't know) my dog could bite his hand off!  Have you two every considered a dog? :D  Best friends AND bodyguards!
