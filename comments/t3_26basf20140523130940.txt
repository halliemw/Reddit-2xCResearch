I'm a straight A student in my 2nd language and I'm learning two more (French and Spanish).  Came to the US with only basic notions of English, started at a community college to deal with depression and panic attacks and did incredibly well.  Transferred into a big University, and thought my As would stop once I started a more challenging school in a law related major as "legalese" was almost a 3rd language in itself.  Nope, I'm still making A's and it looks like I'm going to graduate suma cum ladude if all goes as it has been.  

Last year I went to Granada, Spain on a study abroad program for 4 months and had the time of my life.  While in Europe I also went to Madrid, Rome, Paris (twice) and Amsterdam (talk about partying).  I have recently been accepted to a competitive exchange program in my University and next year I'll be living in France for 6 months, taking classes at a French University, one hour from Paris.  I'm proud of myself and super excited about yet another study abroad experience.  I can't wait, really!

As for girly things, let me see... My hair is super long, curly and beautiful and I just discovered the formula to keep it healthy and I get the most unexpected compliments all the time.  I have been lifting and exercising and getting to wear all my favorite sparkly super cute outfits, and today I get to go out for a girls night out.


Did I brag too much?   :)
