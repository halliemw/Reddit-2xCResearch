Thank you so much for this! So many of my female friends are slightly jealous of my bravery to be so bold. I wait tables and there are plenty of women who tell me they wish they could be so brave and I appreciate it. I honestly tell them that they could pull it off because its about confidence and enjoying yourself. I just wish more women werent so set in standards. Like I said, I enjoy make up and high heels but not for the standards, I just grew up and began liking them. 

I also have a clip on tie that just looks too fabulous. Also, a madhatter top hat for the winter because yes, I am that fly lmfao I am glad that there are men out there like my ex's and your current bf who recognize the woman in us and thats what matters. 

My appearance is deffy a conversation starter and I love talking about my tattoos and my hair and such. Honestly, those conversations keep me going. I would love to post a pic of my hair but I am trying to keep my username on the DL lol :P

Either way, this brightened my night! Keep on keepin on, my lady!
