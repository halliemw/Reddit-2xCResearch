Yes, I just went off the pill two months ago due to mood swings (and because I will only see my bf twice or three times in 6 months). I am thinking about other options - but if you feel so bad I would try to go off the pill and then see. Condoms can be a little annoying, but for a while it should be okay until you figure something out?!
