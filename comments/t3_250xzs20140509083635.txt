You genuinely have to make your own decision. All the people on reddit can see is what you've explained in your story, which is obviously the (very) bad side of the guy. They're also all going to jump on the 'never hit a woman' boat but we all already knew that hitting women is bad... You have a better idea than anyone on here how likely he is to hit you again. It is perfectly realistic that he will never get that drunk again. It's also perfectly realistic that he won't ever hit you again. No one on here has any idea what they guy is normally like but you've presumably been dating him for a long time. That makes everyone's opinion on here almost worthless.

See how he acts over the next few days/weeks and make your own decision. If he genuinely does everything he can to make it up to you and make sure it never happens again and you decide to forgive, good on you. If you feel that you have no future with him because he's not safe to have a future with, also good on you, but don't let the ignorant view of strangers on reddit sway you. Try to make as logical a choice as you can and remember that you don't need him but you won't necessarily be happier without him.
