TwoX had always welcomed people of all sexes and genders with words of support for women's perspectives.. What we don't welcome is the trolls and men or women coming in not supporting OP and arguing devil's advocate, that is not in the spirit of the community. Advice and constructive criticism is different than hate-mongering and abuse.
