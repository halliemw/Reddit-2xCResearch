Thank you so much for sharing that! I'm rather moved! My mother would always try to push our ratty-looking toys and games out the door the second we seemed to lose interest and all of our clothes would disappear and re-appear in a younger family member's closet. I'm sorry that your mother couldn't keep her sentimental items, but it seems like she did a good job making sure you had the option.
