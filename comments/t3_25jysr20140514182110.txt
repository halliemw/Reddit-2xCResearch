I am not criticizing them for being to simplistic. Criticizing them for being too simplistic looks like "They're too simplistic. The bodies don't show any color and look like a single, unbroken mass. " I actually appreciate the minimalist design to the figures. A solid color with highlights makes it *clear* what you're supposed to look at.

Yes, batman has a lot of accessories, but they're not accessories that make him *look* good, they're accessories that help him *do* things, the same with Captain America's shield. Capes, as far as I've seen, are not *usually* interchangeable on an action figure. Batman's solid-black cape is always attached to batman, Superman's bright red, logo-emblazoned cape is always tied to him, so on and so forth.
