>That is why “I know crazy people capable of rational thought” is largely an irrelevant statement (and poor logic).

It's an argument against the idea that all communication from anyone suffering any kind of a mental disorder can merely be dismissed as giving us no insight into their thought processes. I have had personal experiences that contradict this. That's perfectly logical. Rodger's 140-page document appears to have a consistency and rationality that is very different in character to the occasional random outbursts exhibited by the insane; and surely even those tell us something, though I think in this case you are correct that it does require an expert to determine what that is.

We really don't need a professional to connect Rodger's statements with his actions. A pattern can be clearly perceived. We're not dealing with some kind of Voynich manuscript written in a code we could never hope to decipher, though mental health professionals could certainly provide interesting speculation and greater clarity.

This quote deals with rapists rather than murderers, but I think it may be illuminating:
>When compared to men who do not rape, these undetected rapists are measurably more angry at
women, more motivated by the need to dominate and control women, more impulsive and disinhibited in their behavior, more hyper-masculine in their beliefs and attitudes, less empathic and more antisocial.
