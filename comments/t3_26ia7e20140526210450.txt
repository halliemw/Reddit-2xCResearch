I hate them.  I'm small, and have the same problem with not finding the right size.  I never wore them until I was about 20.  I hated them but wore them anyway because I was embarrassed not to.  Pinching, back ache, rubbing, too hot, had to be careful which shirt I wore so parts didn't show.  I've looked at /r/abrathatfits but just got annoyed that I have to strap them in when I don't feel like they need it.

So yeah, I gave up bras almost a year ago now.  I wore one on an interview because, well, interview, but other than that, I either wear loose tops or [these amazing things](http://www.amazon.com/Nippies-Reusable-Silicone-Pasties-ADHESIVE/dp/B00CX547FE/ref=cts_ap_1_fbt) that someone pointed out on this sub about a month ago.  They are gems.  I can wear any of the shirts I want to now without worrying about nipples showing through, which embarrasses me.  I'd be worried about low cut shirts with loose collars, for reasons of bending over, but they were so worth the investment.  If you don't feel self conscious about your nipples showing now and again, though, I'd just say go for what makes you comfortable!
