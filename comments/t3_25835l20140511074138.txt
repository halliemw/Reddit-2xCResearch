When I would go backpacking I would cover ziplock bags with duct tape so I didn't have to horrify everyone with their contents.  Tampons/pads should be packed out, not buried.  If you're gonna be carrying these bags for a couple of days I've found that putting a tea bag in there helps with odor.  Make sure these go up in the bear bag if you're in bear country.  Wet wipes, hand sanitizer, extra toilet paper, and extra baggies are all a must.  Oh yeah, and extra duct tape too!  You never know when you'll need it.  Duct tape works as a great substitute for mole skin.  Happy trails!
