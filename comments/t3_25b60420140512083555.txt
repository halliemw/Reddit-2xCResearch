It wasn't just that fact that bothered me. I felt like she was tearing down women who may not look just like her and went through childbirth. I have a really good friend who had twins but is also a personal trainer so she was very fit before she had her children and looks very fit now after having them. 

I don't like that this is the brutally "honest" portrayal of breastfeeding. I think any picture of any mother breastfeeding is an honest portrayal regardless of what someones stomach looks like or doesn't look like. 

I don't know if its because I'm pregnant and feel so judged on so many levels by other mothers, pregnant mothers, strangers, and those that are child free that I just hate this post. I don't think it does much to bring women together when it's words are tearing women down in my opinion.

I'm going to step off my soap box now.
