I have had a Paraguard IUD since late 2009 and love it. I joke all the time with friends that Paraguard should hire me as their spokesperson. 

I have a fairly high pain tolerance, but the IUD insertion was not that bad. For me, I had a pretty strong and distinct uterine cramp right upon insertion but was comfortable after. You should be given an option of a numbing shot before insertion but talk to your doctor - mine did not recommend the shot as she said some women find the shot worse than the actual insertion.

I have had no problems since 2009. I love that my moods are no longer being regulated by hormone pills and love that it's so effective. None of my partners have been able to feel the IUD. The IUD was also completely free from the device to insertion cost which saved me money long-term.

Your periods will get heavier and crampier but I take ibuprofen during and that makes a world of difference. I'd caution getting the insertion if your periods are already very heavy.

Last thing - if you do decide to get an IUD go to a very reputable doctor. They will measure your cervix before insertion to determine how far to push the IUD and this is a time you want someone who really knows what they're doing to prevent tears and damage.
