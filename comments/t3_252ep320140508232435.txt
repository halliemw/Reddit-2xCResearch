Isn't it amazing, that we expect such young girls to fully accept getting periods, growing boobs, etc. I mean, think back to being 9 or 10 years old... you're still so young, still a child, and your body is turning into something that can have babies. It'll be over a decade more until your brain is fully developed, yet you're expected to understand what's happening to you when your period arrives, and to deal with it responsibly? I just... it's impossibly hard.
