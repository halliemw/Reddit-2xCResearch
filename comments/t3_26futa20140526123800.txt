Not that there is no worth, no. Of course these are attitudes that we should be utilizing; everyone deserves to feel that they have worth. But there is a time and a place, and I feel that sort of statement can be adapted to anybody who has participated within a crime (lots of serial murderers have had shitty lives, most probably far worse than Rogers). It's putting the spotlight wholly onto the perpetrator, not the victims. Is there really a lesson worth learning from his actions? Because that is almost tiptoeing towards apologism.
