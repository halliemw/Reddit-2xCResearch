> He knew beforehand she was not interested in a sexual relationship. That's plenty knowledge and reason. 

That's the very point I've been doubtful of all along, and I said so. I even made it my main point in this whole discussion. He knew beforehand, but maybe didn't know at that moment. She knew beforehand, but did not know at that moment. 
We're moving in circles, and as long as you refuse to even consider he might have been drunk enough to not remember her previous statements, there is no way to have a sensible discussion. ("He might have been..." - "No, he wasn't, he knew!"... Neither of us can say for sure.) I've all the way been stating, that, IF he didn't remember, and IF he was drunk enough so that reason and knowledge weren't given anymore, his actions couldn't be his responsibility alone. In that case, and in that case only. If you refuse the possibility that this case occured, there is nothing more to say.

You seem to have been ignoring my argumentation from the very start, and, as sorry as I am, I don't see any more reason to continue discussing.
