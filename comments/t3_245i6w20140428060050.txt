I am five foot ten! I wear a US 11 shoe (UK 9), and my mum is taller than me and has smaller feet - there's no rhyme or reason to it! No need to extrapolate height from foot size at all. Shoes are a bit of a pain - I live in a pair of DMs because they're practical - but try not to let her go a size down and suffer, here there be dragons and painful toes, as well as potential later problems. Leather shoes will stretch, if needs must. Always research before you go shopping to avoid disappointment/embarrassment/wasted time, know where you can and cannot go and don't bother with the places which don't stock the right size. Also - heels are wonderful, heels are good, anyone who doesn't like her wearing heels is not worth her time. 

I also stopped growing at about fourteen/fifteen, so it's likely she won't get much taller now! She's pretty much done, probably.
