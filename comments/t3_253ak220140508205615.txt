I think what really bothers me is just that it makes me feel all people are bad, simply put.

I feel like I end up witnessing the shitty portion of the population acting horribly a lot but I rarely ever see good, and that's depressing.

It's hard to keep reminding myself there are good people too, when I never really see any. It's getting more and more difficult as time goes on.

There's a lot here to do with my past and how I grew up and things like that, but that's another story.

Basically, I already have a cynical view of the world, and these people just pile on to that.
