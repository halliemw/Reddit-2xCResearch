I think that's part of the point though. Hannah really doesn't dress well, she doesn't dress in the most flattering outfits for her body - she just dresses like Hannah dresses. I'm not overweight myself, but I find her choices refreshingly gutsy. It changed the way I think about how I dress too. I want that dress that makes my butt look a bit big? I will wear that dress. I like the rest of the dress, I like how I feel in it. That's all that matters. 

Now, having said that, I agree that it's not always in your own best interests to dress like Hannah for work environments and stuff. That's just common sense - but again, Hannah doesn't have a shit tonne of that either. She is just a character at the end of the day - I'm not sure how Lena herself dresses as an actual person.
