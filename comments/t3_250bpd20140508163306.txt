My best friend is tall (6 foot) and I have large breasts. We both had wardrobe restrictions in high school, and yes we were both targeted more than a 5 foot girl with small breasts would be-- but that's life. We are now in college, and looking back, we can see the good that dress codes did for us. 


It's not fair that our bodies have been oversexualized, of course, but this is training for life. A skirt that looked absolutely acceptable on me would be genital-baring on my best friend. A v-neck that looks totally cute on her will not fit  over my bust. In all honesty, lots of high schoolers don't care about these distinctions. There are pictures of me in all of my 15-year-old glory wearing shirts that I now would not wear to the craziest night club. My mom would tell me "buy the size up!" and I would complain "BUT ITS NOT FAIR" because I was young and didn't yet understand that different body sizes do need to be accommodated by different sizing. "The sisterhood of the traveling pants" is not reality. High School girls do not always seem to have a firm grasp of this. 


Yes, the same standards need to be applied to boys, but honestly, boys wearing something that is too small SO MUCH LESS OFTEN. Boys who break the dress code should be punished, of course, but from what I've seen, boy's dress code infractions tend to be things like "flip flops" or "wearing a hat indoors". When a teacher tells a boy to take off his hat, he will take it off. When a teacher told this girl to change her skirt, she became embarrassed. Of course it's embarrassing, having to change sucks and nobody wants to be called out on that. That does not make the teacher who called her out creepy. Her whole argument strikes me as very childish, and I don't agree that it's well written. 


Also, that skirt is insanely short and if she bent over there is no way her entire butt would not show. The poofy style of skirt only makes the skirt seem even shorter.
