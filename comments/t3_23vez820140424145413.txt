This isn't meant to implicate anyone on this thread or feminists in general, but I've noticed a trend where people talk about misogyny and feminism, but then fail to provide any statistics or empirical data and instead post wishy-washy academic navel gazing or arguments based on "common sense" or "standard knowledge."  I think when confronted with hard solid data people are a bit more likely to take you seriously.  A bit.  Some people are just so set in their ways that there's no way to win them over.  There's a joke about Women's Studies being a major for people who don't like the rigor required for sociology.  

The other issue I've noticed is a lack of understanding on the terms used in academics versus those used in more common vernacular.  Hence you get these super heated arguments about whether racism = prejudice + power or if minorities can be racist or whether the patriarchy hurts men too.  The hard sciences don't seem to run into this problem as often because the jargon there tends to be more specific to the context.  It's so silly because it really doesn't take that long to explain the definitions you are using and keep the argument based on empirical evidence.
