But there *is* a culture of romanticizing mental illness among certain crowds. Not just... talking about how it's hard or how it sucks, but talking about how beautiful it is that you can see the world as the dying flower of pain and suffering that it truly is, or some such nonsense. It's actually a pretty big problem. If there's nothing wrong with you, it can encourage you to destructive behaviors because they're beautiful or artsy, and if you *are* depressed, it can really help perpetuate that circle of negative thinking. 

Also, anecdotally, my cutting got a lot worse when I realized that other people were hurting themselves *more*, because I didn't feel like my emotions were valid unless I was making really dramatic shows to myself that I was definitely sadder than everyone else. Like I didn't "count" unless I was mutilating myself. So... bad.
