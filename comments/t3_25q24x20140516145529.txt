I started about 2 months ago. I'd say it took about a month or so, maybe a bit more, to get to perfectly clear skin, but I started seeing an improvement almost immediately. I had a perpetual crop of blackheads on my cheeks, and noticed pretty quickly that I had fewer and fewer once I started OCM. I also have this one spot on my cheek, to the left of my mouth, where I pretty much ALWAYS had at least one, often two or three, small but deep, painful cystic pimples, and those are gone. Haven't seen one in weeks and weeks. 

For reference--I use a 50/50 mix (eyeballed, not measured) of avocado oil and jojoba oil, and I'll add a few drops of some essential oil just for scent, usually different with each batch. I chose those because I'd heard really good things about jojoba, and I happened to have the avocado oil. Those have worked fabulously, so I haven't felt the need to experiment beyond that.
