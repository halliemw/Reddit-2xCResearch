Call the clinic and ask if they can recommend a counselor or if they have one on staff. I know you're short on money, but I think it would be worth one session to make sure that you're really sure about this. Having an abortion is ok, and you have ample reason to have one, but it sounds like your emotional health is at risk here. There's nothing wrong with getting a little outside support and help making sure you make the right decision for you and your family, and I think it's a good idea since you sound very uncertain about this right now. You're still early in the pregnancy, so you have a little time to sort this out before you have to make a decision.
