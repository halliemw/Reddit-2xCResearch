Wow... reading through this, all I could think was that this sounded like my own experience with bipolar disorder. And then you dropped the BP bomb! :) Sorry, not trying to make light of it, but it *does* really sound like this might be related to a mood disorder of some sort. This is almost exactly how my mania manifests itself (actually, mine is worse- screaming and threatening divorce). 

Check out r/bipolarSOs; I'll bet they'll have some good advice for you about handling this delicately.
