I could always deal with my stepmother hitting me. That never bothered me much. I barely remember being upset about it. I remember with vivid clarity all the names she called me, the spit, the screaming in my face. 

I know it's a cliche to say it but - unless you're getting broken bones, words and fear and the *threat* of violence hurt much worse than physical abuse actually does. 

With that said - your dad stopped himself from hitting you, and that's something. When anger overtakes people it can be difficult to find any way to control the urge to lash out; the fact that he stopped is a big deal, in its own way.
