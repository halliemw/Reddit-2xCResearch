This made me think, the kind of guy (or lady) who runs from his guilt and takes the easy way out, leaving hurt in his wake... that kind of person would make a pretty terrible spouse. A strong marriage requires two people mature enough to work through their problems, face them head-on and deal with the outcomes. Big, hulking problems with no good options and few compromises available. A man who runs from those things would make an absolutely lousy husband. I dare say you dodged a bullet. (hope its not too soon to say that)
