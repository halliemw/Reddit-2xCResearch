Oh, well I am sure everyone does, but not to get in to too much detail, the majority of what I am shaving is not being pulled taut.  Much is just puffy mounds.  But just by practice, it gets done.

But also in no way do I think women should feel any pressure to shave.  I think all styles can be hot.
