The thing that frustrated me the most is that even if they wanted to write that exact character, there were *still* ways they could have handled it that weren't caving in to such blatant, tired stereotypes. Here's just one, off the top of my head: she sees that guys always want to talk to her due to the fact that she's an attractive woman in an area where there's a disproportionate male/female ratio (and at least in my personal experience, this would be a realistic situation to portray). So she plays along for a minute, invites them up to her hotel room...and demos her amazing app for them and tries to convince them to defect from their companies and come join her startup.
