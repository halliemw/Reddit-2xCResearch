Las Vegas is nonstop for attractive young girls. I got a "now that's some creme brulee" from a large black dude at Caesar's Palace pool and it gave me and my friends a good laugh. I was 18 and I am very pale. I also got a couple "Wow's" from older gentleman the previous night out. All very nice for an 18 year old girl recovering from her first breakup :)
The "are you for sale" my last night out gave me the prompt I needed to shout back "not everything's for sale in vegas" and a couple onlookers laughed a bit while I was in my mad sprint back to my hotel with my furious and concerned friend waiting to scold me for sneaking off on my own.
i grew up in the midwest and I have always noticed honking and catcalling to myself and other girls growing up where I live. The USA is full of places where you will encounter that sort of thing.
