I'm so sorry this is happening to you.

If I could walk thirty seconds ahead of you and soak all of the the aggressions that come to you, I would.

I'm tall and imposing. I'm loud, I stare, I forcibly remove unwanted hands form my person. I stand tall, I don't stare at my feet. I don't shy into myself.

I still cannot leave my house and make it four blocks to a fucking grocery store without some remark or some grapple on my frame. It doesn't matter if it's so cold I'm dressed in three parkas or the dead brutal humid heat wearing a baggy t-shirt and board shorts. I can be pretty and made-up, or greasy and unwashed. It literally makes no difference; apparently I'm just an asshole magnet.

I'm not sure what I'm saying, exactly.

You're not alone, mostly, I think.
