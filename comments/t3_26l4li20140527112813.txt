When hate crimes are committed against jews we don't blame it on a "culture of antisemitism."  Instead we blame it on the individual, and possibly their supporters.  It is possible to acknowledge that antisemitism exists in society without claiming that it is pervasive.

That is why people have a problem with this.  People aren't saying: "there are misogynist men and that is a problem."  They are saying: "Men as a group are entitled and misogynist.  Their behaviour is accepted and reinforced by society."

It goes one step further than the examples you gave.
