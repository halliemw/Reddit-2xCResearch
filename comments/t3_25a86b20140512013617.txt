Welp, this is me definitely. I'm a fellow double-X and I don't know if I offend people all that often. But I do wait it out to test my environment, but sometimes it gets to the point when women are too f*cking sensitive and I could care less if they are offended. Some people need to lighten up and laugh sometimes. 

Example: Girls at work joking about being pregnant or possibly of being pregnant. My friend (similar sense of humor to mine) and I can casually say "Well, there's a flight of stairs over there or a coat hanger in the closet that could take care of that!" This could offend many, but with this girl, we just died laughing.
