I'd say start looking for another job, quick. He won't let you fix your mistakes, he seems to be verbally abusive (which is a big nono to employees) and the paranoia thing is slightly worrying as well as the lying about his "team" quitting/being fired. None of that bodes well, for your own peace of mind, move on and get another job.
