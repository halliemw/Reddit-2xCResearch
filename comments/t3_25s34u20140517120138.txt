Believe it or not, this is actually required by lessors (landlords) in many of the states. It is frequently referred to as "mitigation of damages," in that the lessor actually has an affirmative duty to try and release the location, rather than permit it to sit unused for some time.

Additionally, in all 50 states, any contract (leases included) can be modified with agreement of both parties. As such, whenever lessees contact me, I frequently tell them the above and recommend that they talk to their landlord to work something out.
