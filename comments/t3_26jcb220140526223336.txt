Awesome.

Let us know when you have a funding thing setup.
I'd be happy to offer my time to help with setting this up. I'm not a professional, but I can pretty much organize or administrate my way through most anything. I am sure you've had loads of volunteers but it would be something I'd love to help practically with, and not just monetarily. 

The only thing I can't guarantee is what timezone I will be in.

My other half is an IT contractor, so we move all the time, hence no fixed address. Same for you?
