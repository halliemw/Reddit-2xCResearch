People are funny things. I live in a public/social housing apartment. There are two house clusters just next to each other. One has a straight walking path from public transport, restaurants and shops, mine has small stairs (20 steps?) up to the plane where the houses are. The housing complex next to mine has ALWAYS people hanging around, drunks/teenagers etc. The housing complex where I live has none of them like ever. The difference is 20 steps of stairs.

This is a general phenomenon in humans. If the paper recycling box is next to your table you'll way less likely to have a pile of throw-away papers which tends to be the case if you have to walk 10m to the box. The same goes for food, choice between two equivalent shops etc. 

It *may* also influence your internet habits. Before, you'd actually have to type r/TwoXChromosomes or subscribe to have the content in front of you, now, it appears on your front page. It isn't too far fetched to assume more people will take time to comment - in good and bad.
