I experience this type of pressure all the time; especially with co-workers! My relationship is fairly new (5 months) and I'm already getting the side comments wondering when marriage and kids will happen. It's completely absurd. I remember at the two-month mark, after remarking that I was very happy with the man I had met, my close friend (also co-worker) starting exclaiming about how the wedding would be right around the corner. OMG. Calm your tits, woman. I was flabbergasted by how she jumped to that so quickly.

To answer your question though, you just have to ignore them. People like to follow the soapbox drama of others and get involved when they think you'll be their next source.
