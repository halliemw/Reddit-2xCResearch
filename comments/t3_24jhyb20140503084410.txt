Ooh excellent! I should have known there'd be a subreddit for it, haha. I'll definitely look into that; I have a few local friends I'm leaning on to be my training buddies, so once I've got them convinced they can totally do this, we're gonna hit it hard! In the meantime, I'm just working brief running intervals into my walks as my body feels the need - it's so nice to be able to  run a bit more than my usual without going, "Whoa, whoa - let's not, got the half coming up, don't wanna screw up a knee or anything beforehand."
