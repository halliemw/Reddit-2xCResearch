But...but...these conditions occur outside the campus, as well.  

You make me think that (maybe) the sheer number of college students is a factor.  And college student culture.

Where I teach (commuter college), people react to assault much as they would anywhere else (and so do the police).  I think this helps curb the number of assaults.  College culture (with all its drinking and misinformation) may be part of the problem.

I know that students do not turn to faculty for advice at commuter colleges as much as they use their families; I hope that everyone realizes rights are rights, no matter where a crime takes place.
