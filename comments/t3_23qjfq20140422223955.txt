I've tried this route too. He's super conscientious of customers exercising whilst hurt and doesn't allow it at all. He's always promoting rest days, etc. I told him he was being a huge hypocrite (as well as a raging moron) but he said his customers would lose faith in him if he "didn't face adversity". So stupid
