I think you should discuss with her if she actually likes engaging in friendly ribbing, or if that, in general, makes her uncomfortable. She might be trying to play it cool, but then reach her breaking point because it's something that she actually doesn't like. This would definitely be amplified if there are other people around, especially if you're ribbing her about things she doesn't speak openly about normally. If you're alright with removing that interaction from your relationship you might offer that option to her. This might make her more comfortable talking with you and exploring the issue. It could be the ribbing in general that she doesn't like, or it could be a specific topic that she's uncomfortable with. I find it's easiest to work your way down from broad issues to specific issues.

Do you think you're good at reading other people's body language? That might also help you out a lot with gauging how she's really reacting to the things you say, so you could back off before things start to get really uncomfortable for her. You may be hitting some areas that are really hard for her to talk about, so she might not be really comfortable talking to you about them. Especially if you happen to be joking about them, she might not trust you enough to actually have a conversation about it. It's hard to know for sure without her opening up to you about what specifically is bothering her, but at the same time you can't force her to tell you. That would just end up in all kinds of disaster. It is rather frustrating to be on the side that doesn't really know what's going on. All I can suggest is being patient and receptive to her feelings.
