Just be glad you found this out before one of your cysts burst. I was hospitalized with what I thought was appendicitis, but turned out to be an ovarian cyst burst. It felt like I was being torn apart from the inside. Before this I didn't know that I had PCOS. The ultrasound they had to do to determine what was causing my abdominal pain showed multiple cysts on my ovaries. From that they concluded that I had a larger one burst and the fluid inside(which is pretty caustic) was causing inflammation and pretty large amounts of pain. New BC prescribed and boom no more painful periods, reduced acne, and I haven't had a burst since. Fingers crossed that it never happens again.
