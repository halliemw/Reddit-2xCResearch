I think it's really good to have the information before you need it. 

I lost a best friend to a grossly abusive relationship when she was 18 and her boyfriend 17. It's been about a year and a half and he had convinced her to not go to the college she wanted to and instead to pursue an art career she never really wanted to. She has now dropped out of art school and has lost all her friends because this guy convinces her they'll all out to break them up. She lives with him and writes on her blog how lonely and sad she is all the time. 

I think 16 is especially the age where people learn to get manipulative. It's a terrible time to get sucked into a relationship like that because your life is starting up and it can hold you back so much.
