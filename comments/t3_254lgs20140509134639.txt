Depends. I had laser done on my bikini line and it did come back when I hit my 20s. I don't know if that's because I was younger when I had it done (16), if the lasers weren't as good back then or if it just happens. However, there's a place I've had some done since then and they're really good about hair coming back. Once you pay for a certain area to be done and have all the recommended treatments anything extra required is at cost, even if it's years later. So if you're worried about having hair come back look for a place that offers a good guarantee for those stubborn areas.
