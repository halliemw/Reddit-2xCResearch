I want to try the IUD, one because I like that it's pretty much fail proof and two, because it's the only non-hormonal birth control that I trust. Condoms aren't good for either party and I don't really trust or like the idea of diaphragms or cervical caps.

 I'm honestly not at all sure how it will work out. I haven't had a natural period basically since I got my first period so I have no point of reference. I am hopeful though!
