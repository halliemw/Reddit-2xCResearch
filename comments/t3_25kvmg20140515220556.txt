It's fairly different when it comes to assault. I'd go to the police instantly if I got mugged, groped, had my house broken into, had my radio in my car stolen.

Not everything requires police action, but it's fairly obvious that someone violating you or your things is probably a safe bet to use.

Seriously, I cannot fathom why anyone would avoid the police if they were sexually assaulted. I sure as fuck didn't.
