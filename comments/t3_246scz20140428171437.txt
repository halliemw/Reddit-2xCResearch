We're not asking it to defy gender stereotypes, just to have a single conversation in it not about men. That shouldn't be so much to ask, it should just be normal. In films like Road Trip where its about a bunch of guys going to win back one guy's girlfriend they don't *only* talk about women the whole film. In the 40 year old virgin they don't *only* talk about women.
