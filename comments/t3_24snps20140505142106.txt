Apparently I "look" like a vegetarian lesbian. These things - usually jointly - have come up a lot, when people talk to me about their perceptions.  I've had short, brightly colored hair (so jealous of your mohawk! pictures??) and am really pale. So I don't know... they think I'm pale because I'm anemic and eh... My friend's (now ex-) boyfriend said very directly to me that women weren't attractive unless they had long hair and wore skirts. (I had a pixie cut and was hanging out with them in jeans.) Interestingly it made my friend really uncomfortable as well, because she realized she had sacrificed some of her funky style to "look good for him". 

These days I laugh and just say "sorry no, I like meat AND guys". And I love that clothes can change our look so much, (I've done a lot of work with costumes & theater) so I am totally happy to dress boy-style (I have some great neck-ties that I see no reason why I can't wear) and then switch it up and be super girly.  My bf is equally happy seeing me in geeky tee shirts & jeans or in a little sundress.

If people are asking questions, I would say that indicates you're pretty interesting :) people are trying to figure you out, and you're a bit of a mystery. At any rate, cool people will not ask you a bunch of questions but enjoy your style (and your mohawk) and let you be you! So sometimes these kind of things just screen out the people you probably don't want to hang out with anyway... and that's not a bad thing. More power to you :) -- from a straight jeans-wearing, book-reading, carnivorous girl!
