I would typically wait about a week. I wanted to be sure we had things in common, could hold a conversation and had similar life goals (marriage, no kids, etc.). Chemistry is very important but I didn't want to be distracted by intense chemistry if there was no future in terms of everything else. Obviously, it depends on what type of relationship or lack thereof you are looking for. Usually you can tell when it's time to move things to the next step and meet. First time should be in a public place and low-key. If they've been on the site for a little while, most should understand that the first meet is to determine if there's chemistry in-person. Lastly, it's ok to not move forward if the chemistry's not there.
