Is hair inherently bad? I've had partners ask that I grow out my hair. PartnerS. More than one person has told me that they prefer my vulva with more hair around it, and not one single person has expressed that hair is bad (other than this girl that I dated when I was 15, and she's since changed her views. Chalk it up to youth). Men *and* women have told me that they prefer the hair. 

The less you care, the happier you will be. It's just hair.
