It might be too late to obtain physical evidence but it is still possible to get a conviction and it is certainly something that is worth trying. It reminds me of the rape case of author Liz Seccuro [(link)](http://www.today.com/video/today/41619631#41619631) where she was able to win a conviction after 24 years. But in her case she was able to obtain a written confession from the rapist. He seems to be a reckless person and it might be possible to extract a confession from him. You should contact RAINN and/or your local women support group to see what kind of evidence you could collect before pressing charges.
