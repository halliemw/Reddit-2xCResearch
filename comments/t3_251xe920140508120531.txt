Counseling is a great thing, but not all counseling is great. My wife brought the idea of counseling to me and I was not a fan. She found a counselor nearby that was covered under her insurance and we went to two different sessions. I remember both of us coming out of it no better than when we went in. We agreed that a lot of it had to do with the counselor and how she dealt with the issues we were presenting. I'm saying all this to suggest finding a counselor who you both like. It's important to have someone that can handle your specific situation. Not all counselors are created/educated equally. If he comes out of the first session and is still negative, he might have a valid reason. Just remember to work on finding the counseling that works best for you. For us, that meant finding separate counselors who helped us individually. My anger issues haven't been a problem since going to an individual counselor. It gave me some great perspective without feeling like I was being ganged up on.
