Late high school, I was probably around 17 and was sick of shaving, so I decided to wax my legs myself. I bought a kit at walgreens and followed the directions, but the wax wouldn't come off. It just kind of became this sticky, not quite hard, not quite soft mess of chunky adhesiveness all over my legs and it would not come off.  

The box said to try baby oil if there were issues removing it, but naturally we didn't have any baby oil, so I had to throw pajama pants on over my glob-encrusted legs and waddle back out to walgreens to buy some.  

I also had to be at my after school job at the music store in an hour. So I poured baby oil on top of the wax mess, then attacked my legs with paper towels, which of course just added papery fibers to the sticky, oily mess.  

In a panic because I had to be at work, I just took a blow dryer to my legs and hardened the goop enough that I could get pants on over it. It was the most miserable 4 hour shift of my life.  

My legs were bumpy and chunky and itchy and even when I finally got all the grossness off, I don't think it took any hair with it.  

Never ever again.
