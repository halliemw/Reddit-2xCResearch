That is so true. Kill them with kindness. Pretend that they are very nice and  buy cookies  for the office sometimes or even bake some. I hope they turn around after a while. 
I had very similar experience and they turned out to be real mean b..... and I lost that job because of it. I was a temp and it was the most boring job in the world. Next day I got a job at different department  within the same company and it was the most fun job ever and nicest people. So my satisfaction was that they were stuck in that place for the next few years doing the most boring job in the world. ( One of the examples how these ladies were mean and stupid ). There were only two of us temps at that place and when one of them has a birthday, they buy a cake and tell us that is not for temps, only for full time employees.  Take care my dear..
