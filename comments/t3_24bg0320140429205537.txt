I'm sorry I can't be of much help with this, but I did want to suggest you pick up some lube. You should never be expected to be perfectly physically ready every single time; that's too much damn pressure, girl! Next, maybe you and your boyfriend can put the focus on rediscovering what you like. People's libidos can change throughout life (although I would agree with /u/boredwillow and encourage you to see a doctor/therapist about it because who are we kidding, we are just random people on the internet). Don't view any of this as "your fault" and don't view it as something you have to do to keep your boyfriend happy. It's your body, and it's just throwing you a bit of a curveball at the moment. Best of luck, wish I could bring more information/advice!
