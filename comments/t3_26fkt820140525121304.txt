I'm glad that going back to the basics worked. Something like situation defusing roleplay should be a class everyone should take as a kid (along with how to not be a persistent harassing ass roleplay and basic cooking, health, sex ed, finance, how to be involved in politics, tool use, sewing, how to take care of cast iron pans...).
