GO!!  Congratulations - everything paid for?! Are you kidding?  That is awesome.

I have one suggestion that may spawn a few ideas of your own...  Skype dates.  Commit to Skyping with them once a week or so.  Will it be the same as seeing them face to face?  Nope.  It won't.  But you seem to be a great example to these kids. That example includes doing what's best for YOU.  

Although it seems like you have the financials set, get a job and go home as often as you can and spend that time with them.
