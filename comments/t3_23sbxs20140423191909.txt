We have free weights at home so I work out here. I always wear headphones when I work out, and sometimes between sets I dance around and pretend to be Lady Gaga or whomever. He's walked in on that a couple times...and he's never said a word about it. We just pretend nothing happened and I was being super-serious-weightlifter the whole time.

I don't even know what other things he's caught me doing...singing to the cats and picking my nose probably aren't even the worst of it...
