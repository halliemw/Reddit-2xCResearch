Be honest. Be empathetic, and be communicative. I disagree with the sentiment that guys are simple creatures - many of them simply don't have the lexicon to communicate with. But many *do* have the sentiment and capability.

Framing the interaction can help: Tell him you've had a crush on him, and that you've been looking forward to this, and that this is all a bit of a scary experience. How he handles this information will give you critical insight into his character.

If he can treat you gently given how you approach this, that's worth noting. If he tries to pressure you, that's even more so.

And sex is kinda a hard nugget to crack, so to speak. I don't necessarily agree that sex should *definitely* not happen on a first date, but I'm also not the best judge. In recent months I've been trying going on a few dates with a person to see if I will actually enjoy them beyond sex before I engage in that form of intimacy. So far that decision has served me well. Good luck!
