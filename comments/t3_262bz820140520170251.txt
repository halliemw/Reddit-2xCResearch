There's nothing more irritating than someone who writes an off-topic comment, and hasn't even seen/read the media in question. The deleted commenter was complaining that popular media depicts white men as lazy and stupid...which is sort of a hilarious argument to try and make when we're discussing a show where the protagonists are hard-working and extremely smart (and mostly white) men.
