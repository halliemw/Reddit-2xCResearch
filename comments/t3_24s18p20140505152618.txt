Grew up in TX, only heard of the phenomenon there, never had to experience it. We had a program called "True love waits" at church, but it was voluntary and I skipped out on it when they made us say the word "sex" out loud (I was in 6th grade, so it was everyone from 6th - 12th grade, split up by gender, but not by age... awkward). I was pretty shy, lol. 

Anyways, there were some  purity talks and the like at other church-type functions, but they were oddly enough mostly from the Catholic churches in the area, not the mainline protestants. As far as I know, it's the independent/baptist evangelical churches and the Catholic churches that are doing this stuff, and the Catholic churches are way more chill about it than the indie/baptist variety.
