Regarding child coming first, I totally agree, and so does my s/o. I definitely don't think that I can magically turn her around and she won't act this way. I can't be naive and think that she won't, but at the the same time I don't want to see her in the foster care system across the US. I have to try. Maybe I can find a way to communicate this to her when/if the time comes.

My sister does not trust her father. He thinks that she is making these problems up. When she was 4, she made a comment that he touched her in a bad way, but my mother did not push the issue after reporting it and no charges were made. Her father left the state after this.

The courts still placed her with him because that was not brought up in court due to lack of evidence, and he was a "non offending parent".
