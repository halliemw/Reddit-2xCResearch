Fair enough. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone who was just visiting, but I lived in the same place long enough and traveled enough with those kinds of guys that I felt safe doing so (even as a woman) and knew I wasn't getting ripped off.


That said, I wouldn't have gone with the guy in this story because he sounds like an asshole.
