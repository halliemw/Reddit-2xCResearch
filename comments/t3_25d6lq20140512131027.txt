Marriage does change a relationship, and not always for the better.  Cherish your time as an unmarried couple; use it to carefully evaluate whether you truly share common goals and values.  The honest dialogue you share now could lead to a decision you reach together, rather than waiting for him, while maybe he waits for some sign from you.  Some loving, successful romantic relationships do not result in marriage, and sometimes they evolve into separation with friendship, because time and honesty brought clarity.  Respect marriage and each other by not pushing and not making assumptions.  The wedding lasts but one day.
