In my 30s and yes I have rejected tons of guys. Both tons of awful guys and tons of good guys. Why? Because none of them were right. I hope they'll all find the right one for them and be able to be thankful for the rejection someday instead of bitter about it.

I don't even regret the best ones I rejected because seeing them with their loved ones is proof that love like that can actually exist. We wouldn't have had that together. They just fit in their lives, even though they have ups and downs. It's amazing.

Guys find tall women intimidating, you might have to be more open and approachable to make up for the social construct that says men have to be the tall one in the relationship.

Even though I'm average height, I've had guys who are "only" a few inches taller than me be insecure because they're "short" when it's just they're under 6'. I'd still have to wear heels to be equal height and they're nervous! Women aren't the only one trained into body insecurity by the media.

Some guys have a fetish for tall women, maybe look into seeing if you like/tolerate/enjoy that type of play.
