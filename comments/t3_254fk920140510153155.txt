Toys R Us and Target have them, allegedly.  But for some reason, not my local Target.  The in-store finder says the Target in the next town over has 'em but I don't have a car, so it's not that worth it to me.  But it's a step in the right direction and they absolutely should sell them at Walmart.

You need a distribution deal apparently:
