I had major orthopedic surgery and was given a shit-ton of morphine because they couldn't operate and I had to sleep with a broken arm. At that stage I'd say I'd actually would not have minded some sexy times. Next day I had surgery and was given Ketamine, my arm was anesthetist (which felt shit) and later I was given Morphine. I felt like crap sure, but I wasn't incapacitated.

Most people on the ward were on morphine and similar I think. Tired, hurting but able to understand what was going on around them.
