Yeah I'm torn too, on the one hand, more lovely ladies to lend their ear and wisdom, but on the other, a metric fuckload of trolls and misogynists (or even just stubbornly misled) having an absolute ball.

But yeah I think we'll all need to band together and stick together, hell we might actually make it through to people who need it.
