I was going to ask similar. I've been pregnant. This afternoon, I was feeling pretty nauseous. I've felt that way while pregnant, and late in my pregnancy when my blood pressure was too high (I got induced because of that). My period is due in the next couple of days, so I wasn't sure if it's related to that or not since I shouldn't be pregnant (pill), and my BP seems okay (no headache, which was another symptom of my high BP).
