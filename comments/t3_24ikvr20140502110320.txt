After being on the pill for so long, I'm worried that my hormones are way out of whack. I've tried multiple kinds and am just worried that it's doing more harm than good right now. My mom and sister were both on the pill, my mom now has a patch (post-hysterectomy). I guess I probably just need to bite the bullet and talk to my Dr. Thanks for the input!!
