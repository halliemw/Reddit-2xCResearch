Since when does an university has any jurisdiction to judge rape cases. His record is clean of any crimes. They can of course declare him guilty of breaking some code of conduct, but not guilty of any criminal matter. 

This is why they're wise not to prescribe any stronger punishment. They'd be opening themselves to a pretty big law suit. They can't base a decision on  a supposed rape unless they can prove it.
