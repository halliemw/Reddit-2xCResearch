Exactly, You don't have 100lbs to lose, You have 1lbs to lose, once you loose 1lbs, then you can set a new goal.

I am in a similar place, I have 105lbs to lose, I'm disabled, I've been on 1200 calories for quite a while and I've hit a plateau, I have hyperthyridism and I'm on medications that cause weight gain. It seems like an impossible task, but the idea is not to lose weight, the idea is to get healthy. 

I check myself every few minutes by asking myself 'what am I doing right now, and what will it acheive?' doing this has helped me find a lor of spare time to do a few stretches, and it has stopped me from eating some foods I probably shouldn't.

I've only lost 3lbs, But I have changed my lifestyle for the better and I'm continuing to do so, in time the weight loss will follow, but for now, I just need to have fun within these changes.
