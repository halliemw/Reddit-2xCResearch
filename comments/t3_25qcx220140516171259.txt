What awefulness of Reddit? This subreddit keeps perpetuating the stereotype that we women cannot compete with men and thus need special treatment. Reddit is an anti-sensitive person space not an anti-woman space. People make awful joke all the time you make awful jokes right back at them. Seriously, why do feminist keep trying to act like we women are weak and need special treatment all the time. TwoX being a default just proves the point that we women have a victim-hood complex that we need to get over, that we need to get in there and quit acting like over-sensitive wimps. Are we so weak that we are defeated by jokes? Are we so weak that we can't make jokes right back?
