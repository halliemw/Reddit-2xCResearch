I don't know about an increased risk of miscarriage after stopping the pill, to me that sounds like pseudo-science that's based on the fact that women on the pill are more likely to try for children later than those who aren't, but without seeing the study I could be wrong.

As for long term effects, there is a risk of blood clots, but it's very very small. However, if you're a smoker or you're over 35 or obese or have high blood pressure or a combination of those, your doctor may not be willing to prescribe birth control because while the risk is still low, it's significantly elevated. There's also a very very small risk of gallbladder disease and an increased risk of breast cancer with combination pills. At the same time, there's a decreased risk of ovarian cancer, which is more deadly for most women, so it's a bit of a pick your poison kind of thing.

I've given you what information I know off the top of my head, but what you really need to do is talk to your doctor about all of your concerns so you can agree on something. There are non-hormonal birth control methods that are also highly effective to discuss, as well as the different types and doses of hormonal birth control. If your doctor won't discuss your concerns, find another.
