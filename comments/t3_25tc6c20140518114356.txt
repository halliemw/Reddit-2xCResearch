NO. don't you dare feel guilty. you are standing up. that in turn will give the other woman courage to do the same. you are NOT responsible for his terrible actions. you are BRAVE. please remember this. ETA: by standing up, you are hopefully going to be able to prevent this horrible thing from happening to another woman in the future.
