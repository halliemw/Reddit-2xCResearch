You certainly aren't the only one. People are happy when they find a lifestyle and a balance that works for them and brings happiness and fulfills their life. 
The interesting thing is that you can find enjoyment in ventures that you thought you couldn't. But trying is what comes first. 

Being tall/short, slim/chubby, having a thigh gap or armpit fat are all aesthetic qualities that make people individual. I know for a fact that you can eat what you want and remain healthy/fit, if it means a reasonable amount of exercise 2 or 3 times a week.

I wouldn't worry so much about the parts of your body you might be unhappy with, but instead put energy into your life which in turn will allow you to accept your genetics and who you are. If people put you down for who you are/what you look like, then you're spending time with the wrong crowd. I'm not insinuating that this is the case for you but as a general idea it can apply.

You exercise, you eat what you want and you enjoy it. It doesn't sound like you're making mistakes and doesn't seem like you should feel bad about your lifestyle choices. 

If you have health and happiness, no matter what your shape or size then I can guarantee that you're conviction and enjoyment of life puts you far ahead of those who obsess over their physical appearance.
