Girl bikes, aka Step through bikes, are nice if you don't like kicking your leg over. I do like doing that. It makes me feel fancy.

However, they don't even work with the wearing skirt thing - cause either way your bike might eat your skirt in the break or wheel. 

He's a stupid butt. I'm sorry about him, 'men's' stuff rocks - like the Tshirts, razors, and bikes.
