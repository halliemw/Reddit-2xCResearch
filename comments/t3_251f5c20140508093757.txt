Going to give them the benefit of the doubt and answer the way I think they meant it, even if it was a little blase.

You can't force cultural change, especially ones so deeply ingrained as the sexism that was and is present.  There are decades long fights, that hopefully will be more words than guns, before equality is close.  I think most people knew or should have known that the troops eventually leaving was going to cause some reversion.
