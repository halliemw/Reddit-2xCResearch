Sorry, I can't help myself...  just in case you need a need a bit of a push to give the show a go, or for anyone else wanting to have the Scoobys summarized in a few songs...

Giles, [Behind Blue Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GbVjEApiPU) (the older I get, the sexier he is)

Amber Benson (Tara) doing [Rocky Horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abci1bEim-k).  

**Spoilerish** - [Good bye to you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QX-_d1qNs8)  (OMG, look at that sweet smile, the spark in her eye, the veins on her face.  She just demands to be loved!)

**Minor Spoilers** - [I'll be Mrs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9L68xqqcK4) (Anya's song.  This just kind of hits like a sword through the heart.) 

**Totally Spoilery, watch at your own risk** - [Full of Grace.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3Ll-_Ymp6k)  No words, just a perfect summation of the entire show.

Now go watch Buffy so you don't have to avoid spoilers!
