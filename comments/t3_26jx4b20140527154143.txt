I agree that this ex deserves punishment for his actions and I hope he feels the full weight of the law, but it trivializes and legitimizes real, ongoing violence in prisons when we invoke rape as a legitimate consequence of being in prison. Prisons allow brutalization and rape, including young people and non-violent offenders, men and women; being in prison is their punishment, being raped makes them a victim completely separate from their crime.

edit for word choice :)
