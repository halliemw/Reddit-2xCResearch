You and your family will be okay, don't beat yourself up about it, it's probably the effect of increased hormones and pre-abortion anxiety. I think it's better to go through with the abortion than to not be able to provide for the new baby and the rest of your kids. Your boyfriend supports you and will not hold it against you, so you shouldn't either! Focus on your current family and your 3 kids, be the best mom you can to them, and be more careful/safe in the future :)
