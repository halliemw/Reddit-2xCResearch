I hate being called "cute" too! I am a performer, and I had a teacher recently nonchalantly talk about how I could never play very serious roles because I'm too "little and cute" and I'll always be the ingenue. That's kind of crushing to hear when there are so many amazing roles to play and you feel limited to the wimpy, cute girls.  
  
I had no idea that Emma Watson and Scarlett Johannson were short! That does make me feel better.
