Oh wow, I experience things like those as well. My boss is always making comments about how I need to eat or I'll be weak, and she literally yells at me for taking a short lunch (wtf?). I also notice the staring.. I'm not stupid or oblivious. I just didn't want to believe it, because they are adults and it makes me feel conceited to think they'd be somehow jealous of me. I wish I could see it as a compliment but it is only very, very discouraging.
