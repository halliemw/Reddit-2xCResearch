Echoing Ashilikia a little bit, but talk to your SO.  Bring it up when she's not super emotional, or you know her period is coming in a week or two, and ask what you can do if she just gets upset over nothing.  Sometimes all you need is just to be held onto until the irrational sadness becomes hilarious in its irrationality.  Sometimes you need to be given space.  Sometimes you need a little lovin', and if you have a healthy and mature relationship then these are the kinds of things you should be able to discuss in a healthy and open way so that it's understood that you're just there to help.

I had dated a guy for a long time who just couldn't grasp that someone could be sad for NO reason.  That being tired could trigger tears.  That I wasn't hiding anything from him, and he couldn't analyze the situation and come up with a rational way to fix it all.  Honestly, hearing the rational solution (well there's nothing to really be upset about, so cheer up honey!) is just going to make things worse.  It's not like we don't realize we're being ridiculous.  Hormones suck.  They'll pass.
