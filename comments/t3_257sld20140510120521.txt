I've been raised the same way. Whenever I said something like "yeah" "yes" or "no" my mom would scold me and tell me to say "yes ma'am/sir."  It's like it's programed into me to say that whenever dealing with someone with a position of authority. It was always used as a sign of respect and politeness by me and my brother. I've never come across someone who was taken back by its use, but I'm 18 so I guess it's a bit different than being 22 in other's eyes? I wouldn't know.
