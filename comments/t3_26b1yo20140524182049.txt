So I don't know if reading your comment before seeing the movie caused me to cry prematurely or if it was as sad as I thought it was. Just her wandering around the house screaming, "Daddy" made me cry. I got about half way, read the wiki, and said...., "Yeah. I...I want to not cry for another hour, but I do love this little girl." I'm glad she got that oscar nomination, she deserved it!
