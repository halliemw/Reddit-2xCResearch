 Pro Choice is NOT Pro abortion. Pro Choice is simply recognizing that you don't have any say in what another woman and man do when they are faced with a life changing situation such as pregnancy. Many pro choicers would never get abortions themselves.

>We have the choice to decide whether we do or do not want an abortion

This makes you pro-choice.


>If you are in a committed relationship, accidentally fall pregnant and don't want to keep it, there's a chance the woman's decision not to keep the fetus may be different to the man's opinion. And as much as it's YOUR body, it's HIS child too."

Most people in committed relationships make the choice together. It's a difficult one, especially if the two parties disagree. It's emotionally exhausting.

>I feel that the focus should be on prevention rather than "dealing with" an unwanted pregnancy once it has occurred.

Birth control fails. It's not 100% effective. Condoms break, the pill is wacky and can be interrupted and made weak by the strangest things(even our own bodies). Rapes happen, and sometimes result in pregnancies. The only 100% way to prevent an unwanted pregnancy is through abstinence, but sex is an important part of a relationship. 

It's no ones fault if birth control fails when you're using it properly. It happens. 

Abortions are necessary. How many unwanted babies are you going to adopt? If every woman was forced to carry every baby to term- we would have an insane population problem, and unsafe/life-threatening abortions being performed behind doors. 

>If a person can post about their pro-choice stance, a person should be able to post about their pro-life stance without facing backlash.

Welcome to life. Everyone will always try to challenge your opinions if they disagree- which is also what you're doing to pro-choice activists now.
