Same here.  At a size 4, I still went through pants quickly because it's just how I'm built.  I carry my weight mostly in my legs, and some in my arms, and very little in my stomach.  I'm built for workin' fields!! =)  

It used to really bother me, because I *do* have big legs... but fuck that noise.  I rock, man.  My legs are super-strong and I'm proud of that.
