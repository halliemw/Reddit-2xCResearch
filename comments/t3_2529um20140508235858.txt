You aren't crazy. Him "wanting to be friends" after what happened is a sign of really poor boundaries. 

A few things that have been comforting to me over the years (and maybe they will be to you as well):
 * Initial physical attraction is an involuntary response. I cannot force myself to find someone physically attractive and vice versa
 * I am inherently valuable and nothing anyone does can change that
 * feelings are real but they are not necessarily true
