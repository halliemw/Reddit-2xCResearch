I think it would be more embarrassing to show up alone and hear "aw, no date, honey?" O.o
There is no harm in asking. Most weddings are plus one affairs anyway. That just seems to be the norm in polite society. However, if money for entertaining guests is the issue OR if the family invitees are a large enough number (small venue) then deleting "plus one" is the best way to go. Either way, you will be attending. The important thing is to never show up sans GIFT. Money or registry items only. They are gonna be too busy honeymooning to return duplicate gifts and things they already have. ;-P
