i respond well to saying "please act civil". i react with a huge amount of hostility to someone attempting to impose censorship. encouraging self censorship and awareness is a whole different boat then enforcing censorship of dissenting views. 

keep in mind that in this respect i am actually representative of many males. the message of "please be kind" will almost always be received with more desirable results than "don't say X", when it comes to a male audience. one is encouraging, the other is limiting. 

males are sensitive to limitations and often seek to overcome them. you would be much better served to try and find a way to show a male a limitation that can be overcome in a way the would have them utilize a set of behaviors that you want out of them. think of it like the fly with honey and vinegar analogy.
