>You can't tell me that a community named "against men's rights" advocates men's rights where appropriate. That's absurd. Spending a day in their subreddit proves the absurdity.

I'm not. I'm saying that they are against that movement. Personally, I'm all for men's rights. But the "mens rights movement" is not something I'd back. I hope you can see the difference.
