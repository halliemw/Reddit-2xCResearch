Unconditional love is something many people misinterpret as the giver being a doormat. Most people aren't equipped to receive unconditional love. When you love 'in spite of...' their faults, those faults don't become any less faulty nor do they seem to inspire the person to better themselves. He seems to be a person in both these categories. Unworthy.

I'm sorry he couldn't be the person you thought he was. He could only be what he actually was and that's not someone you really want. Even though it hurts, it might help to think of it as a kindness the universe has shown you in removing this blight from your life.
