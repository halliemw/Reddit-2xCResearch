Eh, I respect people who do their jobs. Every time I hear someone called out of work on a bullshit excuse, *cough cough* I just can't make it in today boss *cough cough* and use it to dick around, all I can wonder is if we are still teenagers calling out of our shifts at fucking Micky Ds? If I had to say someone was an entitled, self-absorbed princess, I'd say its the person who lies to get out of work because he doesn't feel like it. I hope no one is relying on his ass.
