I suffered horribly with UTI's for a couple years which, lucky me, turned into mild intersistal cystitis which is a chronic bladder inflammation. Like you it started after I went sans condom with the dude. Best advice other than what you're already doing is to use lube every time to reduce friction, stay hydrated, using a wipe after your pre sex pee, and finally have HIM wipe his dick off with a wipe before banging.
