Oh man. I feel like this was written by me 8 months ago when I started my current job. (Except for the fact I get harassed a lot, too.) I feel weird complaining to my friends about it because I'm afraid it comes off as bragging, even when I'm talking about times I've been sexually harassed by customers. Or I'm afraid they won't believe me because I'm not pretty or anything, so it's weird that I get hit on so much at work.

My default reaction is to laugh, because I'm the kind of person who laughs at everything, but I don't think that's a great idea because even though my coworkers can tell it's a nervous/uncomfortable laugh (and sometimes swoop in to save me), the guy takes it as encouragement usually.

I used to tell men that I don't give out my phone number. If they hassle me, I tell them to give me their number and then never use it. I wish I had a better response, other than "yeah! That happens to me, too!"
