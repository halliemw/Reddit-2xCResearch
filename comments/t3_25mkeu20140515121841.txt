This is terrible...but I normally have a huge purse with extra pockets in it.  I'm also one of those people who always has napkins and random, useful stuff in said purse.  So if I'm scared of throwing stuff away, I... I'm ashamed...but I wrap it twice as much and put it in a pocket I'm not using on my purse.  Then when I go home I clean out my purse and wash it.
