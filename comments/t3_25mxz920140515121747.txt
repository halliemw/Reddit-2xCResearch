Thank you!!! Right now I'm transitioning to more illustration than graphic design. Every step I've taken, no matter how small, is to achieve this ultimate purpose.

Ugh, dilemmas suck, and part of it is all the money I'll be blowing to travel overseas. I'm trying not to think about the money, I can always earn it back. But yeah, I'll be working SO many hours. I really hope I'll make it worth while.
