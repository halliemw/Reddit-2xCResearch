I'm so sorry that this has happened to you. :( That must be awful, knowing that that happened but that you don't remember it. You can definitely call that non-consensual sex. 

At first I thought, what if he thought you were awake? But he mentioned that you were talking oddly, there's no way he could have not known that you weren't in a coherent enough state to consent to sex, even if you weren't *completely* passed out. However naive he might have been about how wrong it was, he has done something awful. That's a fact.

Whether or not you should talk to him about it should be up to you and how comfortable you are with it, but I can think of some reasons why you might want to. Talking through it with him might help you to get it off your chest, to help answer some unanswered questions, like why he thought that could ever be ok. 

You mentioned you didn't want him to feel bad... even if you think he was naive and is generally well-intentioned, sometimes good people need to feel bad about the awful things that they've done, otherwise they'll never have the opportunity to make it right. Not that this is really about his redemption, it's not, it's about you needing to heal.

I hope some of that made sense. Sorry, I'm not very practiced at giving out advice. I feel for you and hope that this stops weighing so much on your shoulders. :x

But I'd like to stress that he's definitely done something very very wrong, and it's a big deal. You don't need to question yourself about that. Hugs.
