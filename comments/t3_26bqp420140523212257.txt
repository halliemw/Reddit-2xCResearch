1) contemplate getting rid of the pets. they make a mess and make it harder for you. also they are an extra expense and you are about to be tight on money.
2) take the money you save on not having pets and hire maids. 
3) figure out the money value of the maids for doing the chores for you. 
4) calculate house work using the maids prices, ESPECIALLY if he is quitting his job (you can use logic to convince him to do more chores to make up for his lack of bill paying, and you have solid numbers behind how much the chores are worth). 

if its really that big of a problem, than throw money at it to fix it. or at least sit down and create some type of agreement over who will do what. maybe if its on a list or a whiteboard you will both realize how much work you two are doing. 

also if you two disagree over the amount of acceptable cleanliness than have the dirtier person clean first, and the cleaner person tidy up afterwards. this makes sure that stuff is cleaned to the higher standard, but that the cleanest person isn't doing all the work.
