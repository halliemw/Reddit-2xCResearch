My cat was a rescue who was separated from his mother a little too early.  When he was little, he really sucked at cleaning himself, so we'd give him people-baths in the sink/tub.  He quickly learned to accept that this was his people-mumma's way of showing him love/grooming.  

When he's feeling extra affectionate, he'll return the favour after bathtime by "cleaning" our hands and feet with his tongue.  The tongue is sandpapery, but the nibbling between toes is torture.
