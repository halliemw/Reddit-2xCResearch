I Just told you.... 

Listen, arguing with people on the internet is something I have experience with whether I am fat or not. I don't have experience getting hit on, especially not at work. How many times do I have to write that out for you to grasp it? This of all things should prove to you that I do have "bones in my body", and maybe I just need advice on how to deal with this *specific* situation, and don't deserve to be insulted. You are rude and what you said was very hurtful.
