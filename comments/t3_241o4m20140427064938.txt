Does he normally treat you well? Or does he consistently prefer his bros over you? What does he mean by "he would move in if he didn't have anywhere else"? (I agree that's totally alarming and sounds awfully like he thinks moving in with you is only one notch above being homeless...but again you need to give him the benefit of the doubt and clear that up). I think you guys need to have a sit-down conversation about where you guys are at because your outlook of the relationship is starting to affect your mood and other aspects of your relationship...this whole fight about your tentative plans for the night is a symptom of that underlying uncertainty.
