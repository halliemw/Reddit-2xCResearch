A disinterested "No, sorry" *is* being nice person. Are you really suggesting that not saying "bitch" is nice for men whereas not falling over yourself to soften the blow is nice for a woman? What a sexist double standard. 

Nor is basic respect something that deserves a reward. Men are not little babies that need to be praised and rewarded for doing something as automatic as not getting food all over the place when they eat. 

And *especially* when the "bitch" reaction indicates that actually they have no respect.
