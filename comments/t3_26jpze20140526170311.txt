I just want to let you know that you're not alone in dealing with this. I'm in my mid 20s as well and have been having pain in one breast. I'm usually a bit asymmetrical up there, but the breast that has been hurting on and off with my cycle seems to be more swollen lately. And, I have a relative, who went through all the insanity breast cancer involves (late in life thankfully) last year. That of course is not helping to calm my nerves any.

Needless to say it has freaked me out a fair bit. I'm in my mid 20s, everyone loves to act like you're never supposed to have anything wrong with you in your mid 20s where I'm from, that you should hardly ever have to bother visiting a doctor. Yet, here I am already had one reproductive organ issue earlier in life, went through hell with headaches and health insurance a few years ago, and now I'm getting severe breast pain every month for the past few months. 

I put off the possibility of bothering with a doctor and put it off again and scrambled for every potential excuse I could muster. I'm in my mid 20s after all, odds are it's nothing. Then, I just gathered my never and called, finally lined up an appointment, and brought it up to my doctor, who was wonderful about it. She found a lump on the breast that I hadn't noticed during my self examinations, and promptly scheduled a mammogram and ultrasound as early as she could. You really cannot diagnose something like that without testing.

Am I still freaked out? Oh yes. My ever supportive family has acted like I already have cancer since I told them, I haven't even had any tests done yet. But good heavens, the peace of mind, and having some possible solutions to the discomfort I'm dealing with will be worth it. And if it is a worst case, hopefully it will be early enough that treatment won't be so horrible. Please, go see a doctor, and know that somewhere else another woman about your age is dealing with the same mess with her own uncooperative boob alongside you.
