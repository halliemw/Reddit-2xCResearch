I read the article and my problem with the article is in the comment above, but I'll rephrase.  The article is far too broad, how are you possibly going to determine if the internet as a whole is a source of psychological harm for young women?  That would be a HUGE generalization and would lump all the sites that are helpful to young women into that category.  My point is that while there are places on the internet that are sources of psychological harm for people, to take the bad experiences from those places and try to apply it to the internet as a whole is ridiculous.
