We've been having lots of renovations/repairs done on our house lately and a ton of contractors and workers do that. I had a guy working on our floors avoid talking to me for hours and hours, cut me off when I offered him coffee, act agitated when I showed any interest in his work, etc - my SO gets home and the guy is chatty and friendly, explains the steps of everything he's done, and asks a bunch of questions about the lizard in a tank in our living room (my lizard!). Bizarre.  And awkward when I'm the only one home or the only person who knows the issue with the house.

In public I'll just barge into the conversation if I'm being left out but it's incredibly frustrating either way.
