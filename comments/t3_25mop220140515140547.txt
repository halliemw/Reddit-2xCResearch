I agree 100% with this. I relate a lot to this guy and yourself. I also think that he just has really high expectations of himself and can't stand it when he steps out of line from his ideal self. A lot of people are saying depression and I don't think it is. Could be OCD maybe? His inability to let mistakes go because he feels that they shouldn't have happened to begin with. He's just incredibly hard on himself. But really, as cringeworthy as some of his mistakes probably were in the past he needs to understand that you learn the most from your mistakes. And if you can't accept your mistakes you're bound to repeat them again. He has to accept that all those things has made him who he is, a great person. And you wouldn't be with him if you didn't see that. Explain this to him. Also as far as body and height issues go he's going to have to make due. It sounds like he's doing all the right things exercise wise. Maybe a change in diet? Other than that he'll need to treat his height the same way he needs to treat the past, accept it and move on. Easier said than done but if he can do this he'll be much happier. And there is no "this is the day that I accept my past and who I am." It's a constant battle for us all, it may happen more for some than others but it never truly goes away for good. Im not a doctor and I have no experience with major depression so I don't want to rule anything out because I'm in no position to say so. But it sounds like a guy that has really high expectations of himself. He wants every action he does to be a highlight reel when the reality is success is built on mistakes. Hope things get better for him, you're a good girlfriend to seek help for him.
