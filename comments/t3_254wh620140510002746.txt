This is a good point here. Before this sub became default I knew of it and came here when needed. Now that it's default everyone is here, which means tons of 'starting questions' in the realm of equality and women's perspectives. This issue (keeping this sub default or not) is really about the direction this sub wants to take in the future. Do they want to be a community for like minded people to come hang out and shoot the shit, or do the mods want this community to become a information resource for gender equality and women's perspectives on any issue at hand. As long as this sub is going to be a default, the second option will be what this sub is. I don't see it being a small hangout spot anymore where people can say whatever without someone in the public getting offended by whatever was said.
