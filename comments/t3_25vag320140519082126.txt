For real. If you learn about a psychological theory for example (let's say the social cognitive learning theory), there will be a lot of things where you will say "Well, duh! Isn't that just common sense?" But that's just how it works, there's a lot of stuff which *is* common sense but if you don't have it backed up scientifically it's meaningless, at least in the context of science and research.

And to me, the claims those 58 studies have made don't even sound that erroneous. That our period influences which party we vote for is maybe a bit far-fetched, of course, but from an anthropological viewpoint it makes sense that we are being influenced by things like that (on a smaller scale). Which doesn't mean it only happens with women, either, men are also being influenced by their, well, biological purpose. But that's just my opinion as a layman here.
