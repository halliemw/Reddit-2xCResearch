I agree. I am sickened by how the courts and police treat DV victims. 

I was with an abusive partner off and on for five years.

I lost track of how many times I called the police. Friends in OTHER CITIES called my local police, terrified for me. The hospital made reports. I actually ended up in the custody of the state (not incarcerated, but involuntarily in the mental health system) because social workers/doctors were concerned for my safety because I kept returning to the relationship. To quote one of them, "you're going to end up dead". 

He is just FINALLY now in jail on felony domestic battery charges (well, he's been there ~3 months now), in large part because the police and courts continually demanded details I couldn't provide. They would tell me that my stories didn't add up, that I needed better explanations, that I should've reported it sooner, that there was no solid proof, etc. On more than one occasion I had police officers make comments that I found vulgar, inappropriate, and uncalled for. 

I'm sure my stories "didn't add up". It's kind of hard to keep details straight when you're slammed into shit and knocked around. It's kind of hard to report abuse in a timely fashion when your abuser won't let you! And I'll readily admit that I forgot a lot of details because I drank myself into oblivion to cope with the abuse. 

I find it hard to have much faith in the legal system regarding matters like this. Sure, people should report it (if they're in a safe position to do so) but don't assume that anything will be done. Make a safety plan and get the fuck out of there and don't look back.
