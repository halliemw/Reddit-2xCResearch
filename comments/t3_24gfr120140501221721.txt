No. You're just wrong in that regards. It's surely sexist, but it is a speech about sexism. A speech a spoken expression of ideas, opinions, etc., that is made by someone who is speaking in front of a group of people. There have been speeches about sexism. And racism. Hitler gave many speeches that were filled with very hateful ideals, but they were still speeches. Because that is what a speech. An expression of ideas to people.

A speech isn't a speech because you agree with it or because it is morally good.
