Condoms are the only thing I'm aware of that help prevent multiple diseases and infections as well as pregnancy. There may be some newfangled method out there, someone more up to date on sexual education may know of something.

All other STI/STD prevention methods I know of besides dental dams are drugs, and I'm pretty sure they're only for specific things (like HPV or HIV) and don't double as birth control.
