I moved 2,000 miles across the country for the internship I'm at now. I'm so incredibly lonely right now. It seems like everyone who I work with is already friends with each other, and I have a lot of trouble breaking in. I'm pretty quiet to begin with, and it seems like everyone here is super outgoing and loud. My best friend is deployed in Korea and my boyfriend is back home and neither of us really have enough money to make frequent visits a thing. We see each other every three months or so for one weekend.  

I pretty much just spend my off weekends in my apartment reading or cleaning. It's pretty pathetic and I'm not happy with myself and my lack of social interaction. I just joined a meetup group online, and hopefully on my next weekend off, they'll be doing something and I can go try to socialize. I'm fairly worried that it'll be like the last time I tried going out with some people from work though - I ended up alone at a table because the people I came with recognized some other people and kinda ditched me, so I just paid my tab and left.

Sorry that's not very helpful, I'm just so sad and alone now, even typing it out to an internet stranger makes me feel somehow less alone. At least I know I'm not the only one going through some issues in my life.
