Ultimately, she will make the decision as to whether or not she uses her own power to help her body or not. You can present her with the information of what the food's she's eating are doing to her very cells, and what the outcome will be down the track. (If you don't know how to explain these things, encourage her to see a doctor who will.) The complications of charcot foot will most likely be amputation. It's her decision. Maybe she would rather eat the foods she likes than keep her feet? But then there's also the cost. That kind of operation and added hospital stay, rehab and additional equipment she'd need following a below knee amputation are very expensive. Perhaps that will deter her? 

As a nurse who's seen dozens of diabetics display non-compliance to their diet/insulin/non-weight-bearing of their foot ulcers, and consequently lose their foot, I can see how hard it is for a person to make that kind of lifestyle change. It's a really hard concept to grasp, because you can't really see what's happening to your body at a cellular level. 

I hope she discovers the importance of healthy eating before it's too late. This isn't your fault or your responsibility! Your mother is so lucky to have you :)
