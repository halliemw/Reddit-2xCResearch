Oh man. Ok here we go.

Remove makeup with mineral oil. Cleanse with CeraVe hydrating. Exfoliate with 2% BHA liquid. Vitamin C Serum. Moisturize with coconut oil. Eye cream. Lip Balm. Self tanner on some nights, body lotion if not. Argan oil in hair. Cuticle oil if needed. Tweeze eyebrows if needed. Vaseline on feet followed by socks once a week: seriously works wonders for calluses. Cup of spearmint tea with a squeeze of lemon and a bit of apple cider vinegar.

I like my bedtime pampering, it soothes me.
