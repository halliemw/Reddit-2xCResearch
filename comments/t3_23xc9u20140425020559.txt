Eh. With family, I've found that it is very often better for my psyche to not address some problems head-on. I don't know why, but family is weird like that sometimes. Some people I know have wonderful families they can tell anything in the entire world to, but that is not most people I know! 

When the issue is super important to you, sure, but at the same time... not everything is the most important thing to be 100% honest about. I don't tell my family loads of things, because we're all happier that way. Politics, things that might offend them needlessly, that sort of thing. If it's super important to OP that she explain to her parents how she lives a new lifestyle now, how it's different from theirs, how this means that she eats less, and how it's not unhealthy because of X, Y and Z evidence... she can. I would just rather stick my hand in a hive of bees than have that conversation with *my* mother. But by all means, if OP wants to do that, that's always an option.
