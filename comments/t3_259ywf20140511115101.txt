This puts the bride in a bad position. Most people in that situation would lie and say your invitation must have been lost in the mail, rather than tell you that they didn't invite you. 

All of these people giving anecdotal responses could very well have been lied to, and they actually weren't invited to the wedding, but the bride/groom felt bad and let them come rather than tell them the truth.

If you really want to know, privately ask the mother of the bride/groom to find out for you. Tell them you don't want to put the bride in a bad position, and you are perfectly fine if you didn't get invited, you just want to discreetly find out for sure so you don't seem rude by not attending.
