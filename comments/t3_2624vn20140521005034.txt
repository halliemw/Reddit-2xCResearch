women get shamed for being fat, men get shamed for having a low income. these are comparable. many women are looking for men who make more money than them, they want a guy who is a primary provider. some women are not like this but they are relatively rare compared to the ones that are like this. men generally don't care that much about women's income. 

men find it important to have a woman they consider physically attractive. this is comparable with his income. the richer a man is, the more likely that society expects him to be with a physically attractive woman. the more physically attractive a woman is, the more that society expects her to get with a rich man. 

so when you hear a guy fat shaming. just keep in mind that men get shamed or passed over completely for not making much money. and women call these men derogatory things if they are not trying to improve their lot in life and still expect to be highly successful with women in relationships. 

a fat woman is like a man with no job. a fat woman who embraces fat acceptance is like a man with no job and no ambition to get a job, who wants to be praised for it. an attractive woman is like a man with a high paying career. woman's body is like man's wallet. they are both judged by each other. and they both objectify each other in the process.
