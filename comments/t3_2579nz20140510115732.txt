The problem is that you cannot know if this will be the case with him.

I'm glad that the "inappropriate unwanted physical contact" didn't lead to anything more. But, what if it would have? Of course, hindsight is 20/20, but just as your case turned out okay, many other cases have not turned out this way.

He needs help, or at least some perspective. This is something that OP can't give him. 

I'm not advocating for cops, just yet, but she needs to document this and make sure other people are aware. Hindsight IS 20/20 and you'd be amazed how many people wished they would have seen the warning signs (or paid attention to them).

>not a threat and this happens everyday without people being hurt or jailed

>inappropriate unwanted physical contact

This is a scary thought. Unwanted attention is still unwanted attention. I'm still baffled that you can look back and laugh at it 15 years later. And I'm glad that he has a family now and a good job. But it really makes me wonder about how many other people he made uncomfortable and what help, if any he needed/got
