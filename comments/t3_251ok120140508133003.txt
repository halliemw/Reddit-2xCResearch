I do understand this.  I was just commenting on the fact that the mods keep saying something like, "Just keep reporting and everything will be fine."  I am skeptical that this strategy will work since I am already becoming fatigued with sifting through all the troll or "[deleted]" comments to find insightful responses.

I am however hopeful this will all blow over and twox will return to being an insightful and safe place to engage with strangers on the internet without feeling attacked by responses.
