Have to admit I read this on an Advice Mallard..... "If someone wants to break up with you....Let them."

Trust your gut.   if your gut says yr SO is acting funny then they probably are...perhaps attempting to distance themselves....for whatever reason.... let them go.   
That would have served me well.
