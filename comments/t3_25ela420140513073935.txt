Am I the only one that likes seeing people breastfeed in public? Happy babies with healthy appetites make me happy, as do mums who feel comfortable feeding their child when and where it's needed. Besides, asking mums to go somewhere else to feed their children kind of puts a damper on conversation. It's perfectly possible to keep talking to someone who is feeding their child, you just have to make sure not to distract the baby.
