Don't worry! HPV is so common - the majority of sexually active people will contract one or more strains of it in their lifetime and most won't even know it. Even perfect condom usage can't prevent it since it can transmit via skin-to-skin contact of the genitals; so, someone who has slept with only one person can contract it.

In the vast majority of cases, the HPV (high risk or not) will clear up on its own within a couple of years. The fact that your doctor asked you to come back in a year and not in a few months is a great sign that your cervix only showed very low-grade dysplasia - meaning if it did ever evolve into cervical cancer, which it most likely will not if you continue to receive care and go to your appointments - it will take a long time (up to 10 years!) from this point.

I know it can be stressful but rest assured that there's nothing you could have done to prevent it aside from remaining a virgin, it would take a long time to become anything remotely close to cervical cancer, and your doctor will monitor it enough to ensure it most likely won't get to that point. 

I've had abnormal cervical cells show up on my paps the last few years and I've actually found that taking folic acid supplements and B vitamins have increasingly improved my results. You may want to look into it. Generally, if you take good care of your health and don't smoke, your body should be able to suppress the virus within a year or two.

Let me know if you want to chat and again, don't worry! :)
