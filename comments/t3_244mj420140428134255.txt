Perhaps I was not clear enough in describing my experience, but yours really does not sound all that different from mine minus my not being sent to a psychologist and my having to go in for an ultrasound and bloodwork every two days. As I said, I did not have sex at all while I was on the medication. The only time when I mentioned having sex rarely was when I was initially asked to go off of my oral birth control pill when I first applied to be a donor. 
I was never asked to provide pictures of my family members, only of myself. I never gave their personal information besides their medical history; I was only asked to describe the kind of people they were (job, interests, education level, etc).
