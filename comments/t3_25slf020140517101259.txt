That sucks. Especially because cooking is referred to as a women's role, but "chefs" are dominantly male.

Working at Best Buy my GM was a womanizing pos. It took six months to convince him that I could sell computers, while I was working in the area almost everyday because the associates didn't know simple things like internal hard drives or distinguishing processor speeds. I found out later that they were actually paid more than me by $.50-.80 with no difference in experience or time spent at the store. Whenever I worked and didn't wear makeup, he would tell me I didn't look as pretty as I usually do. I have constant "resting bitch face" no matter how happy I am, and I'd always be told to smile. The last thing he did before I quit was special order me a women's size S shirt (everything is in male sizes) without request. I refused to wear it for a really long time until one day everything was just so dirty I wore it, and he stopped me in the middle of the aisle, and said, "Wow, you really fill that in nicely."

[Turns out, he wasn't a nice guy.](http://www.doj.state.wi.us/media-center/2010-news-releases/march-29-2010-2)
