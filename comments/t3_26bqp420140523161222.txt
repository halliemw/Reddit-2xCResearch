Have you tried cleaning in the morning?

Our landlord is selling our condo right now which means that it has to be pristine 100% of the time.  We tried cleaning it at night and just ended up squabbling about it feeling tired and drained.

And then a magical thing happened--we started to clean the condo in the morning.  I pick up and wash dishes while I have my coffee and wait the recommended 10 minutes for sunscreen to set on my face.  It is SO MUCH EASIER to do 20 minutes of housework in the morning than it is to do it in the evening.  It barely feels like a chore (and I am super cleaning-averse).
