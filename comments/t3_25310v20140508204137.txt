For me this would be insulting. I love to wear makeup, I know what looks good on me but I rarely wear it to work. If I do it's a bit of foundation and blush. I don't need a lesson subtly trying to convince me that doing a full face of makeup is going to somehow help my career. The only times I do a full face is when I have a function after work. 

Eugh. It seems so tacky.
