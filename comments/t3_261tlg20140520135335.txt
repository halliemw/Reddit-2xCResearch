It's so interesting that to some people, like the girl who commented on you, that was some sort of "compliment" to her. I'm sure in her head, she sees nothing wrong with saying that. As bad as she might have felt seeing you in a bikini top, why on earth do some people feel the need to make others feel bad as well??? 

I'm really just trying to weigh the options right now, since there's not a great solution. Regardless of my choice, they will make a big deal of it: I either go, conform to their ridiculous requests that I wear something over a bathing suit - although I'm sure they will still make comments - or I don't go, and have to hear all about how sad the kid was, etc etc. These women seem so self sufficient and secure in so many aspects of their life, it just figures that I am feeling some insane form of guilt for bringing it out in otherwise seemingly well-adjusted women. BAH!
