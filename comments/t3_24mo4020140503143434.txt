My father *is* a bully. I've known that for a long long time. I guess because his life has been difficult I always felt like that was some sort of reason for me to tolerate it my whole life. My boyfriend is the one who sort of helped me realize that just because someone has had a hard life, doesn't give them cause to treat others like shit. 

Thank you for your kindness as well, however I live in CA! If I did live in PA, believe you me I'd take you up on that offer.
