Your feet sweat, even if you don't notice.    What you want to do is air dry them as soon as you come home to increase the longevity of your shoes.   Since they're flats, I'm not sure that they would be safe to wash.   Consider a shoe rack where they can get good access to dry out.   If you are really uncomfortable with the way the inside looks, consider buying inserts and taking them out each day.   Best to you!
