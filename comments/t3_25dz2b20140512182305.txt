I have had guys see me with my boyfriend (now my ex) and ask "is that your boyfriend?"  After I say yes they then proceeded to ask me out or tell me they could fuck me better than he does. 
What?!

Edit:
I was at a club with some friends and was dancing when this big bodybuilder type (huge muscles) comes up to ask me to dance. I almost always said yes to anyone who asked me for a dance so I go ahead and dance with the guy. About midway through the song he   starts putting his arms around me and tries to kiss me. I turned my head and he proceeded to lick my neck all the way to my ear. Then he fucking grabbed my ass with both hands and lifted me while trying to motorboat my tits!! He told me to wrap my legs around him. I said no and put me the fuck down now!! It happened really fast.
I was drunk and a little freaked out so I waited a few minutes then walked away without saying anything. My friends said the guy kept looking for me.
