Idou are wrong, you're just the stubborn knd of person who will never be persuaded by anyone because you've already vocalized your opinion. You are wrong. It is a waste of time trying to convince those who by their very nature can't be convinced. What I said was right. If you didnt see it, then that is unfortunate for you.

I would also not waste my time arguing with someone who stubbornly said the sky was made of silk or that the earth is flat.  I'm not going to waste my time on that, and your argument is just as silly and so obviously wrong. No need to gather evidence. It's plain to see. You do not need to believe in racism or sexism to laugh at jokes about them. Even the ones that are clearly written by someone with those views. Because this is so plainly obvious and factual, I'll waste no more time arguing against your false opinion.
