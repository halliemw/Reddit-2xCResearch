Unless your friend is confident in being able to resolve this issue internally by talking to superiors and people in charge of pay and compensation, there is going to be no easy way to resolve this issue which would not result in a massive upset in your friend's work life. Employment discrimination and equal pay violations, though they are covered by separate statutes (Title VII and the Equal Pay Act) are both administered by the EEOC. Dealing with the EEOC is very difficult because of timelines by which you must submit or file certain documents with the Commission and with relevant courts, as well as the EEOC's own constrained budget (which limits how much they can investigate matters which aren't really egregious). Talk to an attorney who specializes in labor, civil rights, and wage and hour law. They will be your best bet to guide you through such a process. They will also be much more familiar with what counts as good evidence of pay discrimination and will be able to point you in the right direction. The best part is that all of that can be secret from your employer. 

Fortunately, there's a good reason to start looking back over a twenty year career. The Supreme Court had ruled in 2007 that the statute of limitations on equal pay violations started with the first unequal paycheck and then expired; in many cases, pay would equalize, but any adverse affect of that first unequal treatment then did not count as a new equal pay violation. This was ridiculous considering it can take decades for such violations to come to light. Congress overruled that decision with the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which, to simplify, basically says that every paycheck resulting from a discriminatory one is actionable under the original statute. 

Also, my own personal bias: do not trust HR, the entire department exists to protect the company from issues like this, not to be your friend, as much as they may act like it.
