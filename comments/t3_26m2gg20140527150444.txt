The NYTimes did a story about divorcing one's parents a while ago and it got thousands of comments from adult children who feel exactly as you do. There is an incredible about of societal and cultural pressure NOT to dislike mom, no matter what. Add to that the covert nature of so much abuse (it ain't all physical and it ain't all obvious) plus the special kind of Stockholm Syndrome experienced by kids who are trapped until they can escape....no wonder you are having a hard time coming to terms with how you feel about her.
