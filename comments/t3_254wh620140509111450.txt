Hey there, we hear you and we are reading everything in posts like this, we appreciate you taking the time to write this up. Here's the thing, this doesn't have to be permanent and we haven't made any final decisions yet, but we do want to give this bit more time to see where it goes.

You make a lot of really good points and we will absolutely take them into consideration. I've said it before but it bears repeating our top priority is now and always has been this community and the women that make it. If this does turn out to be the wrong thing to do for the community we'll reverse it. I know this isn't what you want to hear right now but we do still want to give it a bit more time before giving up.
