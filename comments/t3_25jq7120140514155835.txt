Did you even read the rest of those sentences that you quoted fragments of and then gave a response to?

>The more you try to...imply that women's issues are somehow more valid ... more equal than others

I made no such claim, nor would I. Acknowledging differences is a way of acknowledging diversity. We cannot come to a conversation on equality in a diverse environment if we are not willing to acknowledge that certain issues affect others more than ourselves.

>It's not a hard life, but there are times when I'm afflicted by the fragility and complexity that is humanity when I'm simply told to man up, where a woman might be treated more sympathetically. On those occasions, I might want to be treated, based on my state of mind, not how my gender is expected to behave, yes.

Let me put the question another way. Do you want to not be seen as a man, or do you want society to treat you, as a man, in a more fair and equitable thing? One is a matter of whether you want to throw out a particular aspect of your identity. The other is whether you want society to be more accepting of your identity, no matter what it is.
