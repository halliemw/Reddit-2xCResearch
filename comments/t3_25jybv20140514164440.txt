I see the point you are making and it makes sense but we are still talking about a human not an animal. With that said it still seems like a very difficult situation. I am fairly liberal on most issues but it still seems like we are trying to justify murder because it is inconvenient for us. I don't know the correct answer, I am just trying to get as many facts and points of view as possible to make the most educated decisions I can. Thank you.
