How many times do I need to spell this out. It's her body. Being a biological parent does not give you any right to have a say in another person's health decisions. 

It doesn't matter if you agree with her choice. It's her body and it's her choice. She's the only one with any say in the decision. 

Oh, look you're against paternal child support too. Great. You must really care about the welfare of children and women. 

> And I would argue about that, the kid is not hers, if it were inside of the mother, she would have all the power, does she lose her claim to her child, just because it is not inside of her?

She has no claim over the other woman's body. No one has any claim over another woman's body. It's her body, her choice, no exceptions.
