Age 9-10 is average for my family. I was the late one at 13, the result of low body fat and gymnastics. Even then, I had proper breasts at 10, pubic hair and BO at 8, and acne at 9. I think I was in bras around 9 as well. 

My sister was 5'0" in the third grade and towered over everyone. She had busty woman sized breasts by 5th grade. She topped out at 5'4" in 6th grade and that was that... she was as physically grown woman as she was ever going to get.

In my case, I was small for my age until 6th grade, other than being unexpectedly curvy. I had a final growth spurt at 15 (quit gymnastics and gained 30 pounds) and shot past my sister to 5'6".

Since my sis is 5 years older and went through it early, periods were just a fact of life at home. Supplies were already around, and overhearing my sister's experiences over the course of childhood took away the mystery.
