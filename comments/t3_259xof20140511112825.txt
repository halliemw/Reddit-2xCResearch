It's the capitol of the state. I guess I'm just a boring person. I don't really enjoy drinking, have no interest in clubbing and such. So I should try to find a book club or something similar!

I've tried OKC with mixed success. I keep attracting couples looking for their "Third" and that wont really work haha.
