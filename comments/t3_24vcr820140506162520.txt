if you're worried about looking too young, make sure that your wardrobe isn't too young looking.  I'm sort too and I hate getting my clothes tailored.

But I have to say.....this kinda sounds like a 'first would problem'.  If being short is the biggest of your worries then you have it amazingly good!
