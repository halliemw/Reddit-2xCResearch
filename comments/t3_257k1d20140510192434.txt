How old are you? My mom and her Aunt have been on birth control since they got their periods at the age of thirteen. Mine wants me on birth control, but I've tried out at least six different pills and I ended up getting my period all the time. It's important to note that PCOS runs in our family and I'm pretty likely to lose an ovary by not having hormone therapy due to my family history of losing ovaries. Hence the reason my mom and Aunt were on birth control for so long.
