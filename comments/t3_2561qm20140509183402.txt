Agreed! In Canada, (to the best of my understanding), parents get X amount of hours and they can decide who takes what for what amount. An old boss of mine took half of the parental leave, so both he and his wife could spend time with the kid. Thought it was brilliant. Both of them lost out on some work opportunities because of it (both lawyers), but neither career was significantly stunted. 

Obviously it goes beyond that, though. Women tend to take more time off work for child sickness, etc. So that would need to be normalized and accepted as well.
