Break up with this dude.  End of story.  I don't care how nice he's been the rest of the time and how sorry he is now, this was unacceptable behavior, it's really bad, the reactions from his family were bad, and even if it was just when he drinks, I guarantee it'll happen again if you forgive it this time.

If he's sorry, let him be sorry, but that doesn't mean you should stick around.  Move on, I tell you, and do it immediately.  Don't be swayed by his pleas to give him another chance.  Tell him that this shit is a dealbreaker and that you wish him the best of luck and hope he learns to control himself, but that it's too late for saving the relationship between the two of you--and then tell him not to contact you again.  If he continues bothering you at that point, tell him you'll be filing a restraining order (oh by the way, take pictures of your bruises for this purpose.)

You might think this is overkill, and hopefully just telling the dude you're done is enough for him to leave you alone.  But you never know, so be prepared to take further steps.  I'm guessing the crazy is strong with this guy, but it's just hidden under the surface and this is the first time you've actually seen it--but wouldn't be the last if you were to keep seeing him.

Maybe there's some small chance that he's a good guy and this is just a fluke where he got really, really fucked up.  Well, how is it he gets so fucked up?  You think that'll never happen again?  Maybe he has a problem with alcohol.

Those are issues for him to worry about and fix on his own, while he's reflecting on how he lost you.  If you stay, you're condoning his behavior and inviting more.
