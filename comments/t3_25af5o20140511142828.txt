Whoa...that's me, too, even to the age of 9. My mother left behind a baby book containing the most precious traces of her I managed to cling to over the years. Reading the words in her crabbed, precise British handwriting somehow not only brings her back to me but also validates my own existence in some odd way. You're so lucky to have such a richly detailed memoir of how she felt about you. It's a treasure and a comfort, isn't it?

I'm now grown with four decades of healing to smooth over the shattered edges, but I never got over it. Mother's Day was a bitter test for me, and the fact it came around during the school year served cast a stark public spotlight on me as an outsider. I sometimes wonder if the disconnection I feel from my own gender is a reflection of how I felt growing up as a motherless little girl. This day still burns as a reminder of my personal pain and loss, and this year, damn Photobucket even had to rub it in with some "message from Mom" spam ad that made me clench up to read it. I never had children, so the anguish I felt ends with me. That's a thin consolation, but I'll take emotional comfort any way I can rationalize it.
