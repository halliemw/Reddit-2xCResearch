I mean, it'd be worth it if I knew it would like... stop my period with no side effects, or were very cheap (so I wouldn't feel bad about removing it if it did not effectively do those things). Temporary pain on insertion is like, fine, it's over quick, I don't really care about *that*. But those other two things really prevent me from taking that leap.
