The year away had been planned since more or less the beginning of our relationship so we decided to stay together long distance when I left. It wasn't until after a month or so of being away my thoughts became much clearer, I realised the relationship wasn't right for me and I could envision a life without him. The distance really helped make the cut because I was living independently anyway so I could see that being alone isn't the end of the world! 

> and now I'll be alone again. I guess the difference this time is that I'll have a cat.

Thats the attitude! (I'm gonna go ahead and presume you weren't being sarcastic :p) You know you're both going to have a rough time for a while when you break up, but in the end you will both likely find much better matches, and anyway being single aint so bad. I would advise you to make practical arrangements, like detangling finances, where you're gonna live etc. so splitting up doesn't seem so daunting - then just surround yourself with loved ones and take the plunge. Wish you the best.
