I think that, ultimately, having a baby is something you should not do if you are not ready. Your relationship might not last, regardless of whether or not you get an abortion. But that baby will, forever. If you're not ready to be a parent, the responsible thing is for you to not have a baby. The "child" he's referring to isn't a child, it's no more of a child than a sperm or an egg is, and we flush those out of us all the time. I think you're making the best decision given the circumstances.
