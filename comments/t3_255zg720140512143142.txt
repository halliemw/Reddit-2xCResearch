I can think of very few things worse that bleeding my family dry, financially and emotionally, while I hang in limbo.  As much as I know it will be tough, when the time comes, I want them to be able to go on and live, and not go through any more torture than it will already be. 

Also, I think your line of work is a rough, rough job - emotionally, physically and financially.  Thank you for all the small kindnesses and respect you give to those that never thank you.  To be kind, to be respectful to those that will not or cannot thank you is a mark of a truly good soul.  

I know I'm assuming a lot about you - if you are a bad person, just ignore what I've written :)   

(I really really hope this is as funny as I want it to be.  If not, just know that I wasn't trying to be offensive.)
