If she started freaking out about it like she has here, I'd guess he was just getting irritated that she was acting so entitled. Or maybe he was misinformed about the bikes and thought the girl bike was designed with more womanly dimensions in mind, like wider hips and a lower center of gravity, but he didn't know how to express it. In any case, the fact that they ended up yelling at each other over a bike suggests that neither of them handled it properly, and honestly it's a petty thing for OP or anyone to get upset over when someone is buying them a gift.
