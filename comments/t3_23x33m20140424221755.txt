I just want to let you know that you are AMAZING and so strong. Seriously, you are behaving so much more rationally than many, many people in your situation would. Keep it up! That's really great your ex is letting you stay. Like someone else said, just stay the course and keep in mind that your mother is grown and perfectly capable of making her own choices. She chooses to stay with your dad and take his side - that's on HER. You are not in any way responsible for that. As a woman now you have to do what's best for your emotional and physical health. If these charges hold up, just keep in mind your dad knew it was illegal to physically assault you when he made the choice to do it. If he loses anything it is HIS OWN FAULT, not yours. Stay strong <3
