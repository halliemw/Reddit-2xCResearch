Have fun with her.  Don't choose your activities based on what think a girl would like; choose them based on her personality and on what you enjoy. Her most cherished memories will be the ones of sharing joys and feeling validated by you.  Leave the door open for her to develop herself; when she shows interest in something, encourage her in those areas.  Introduce her to the things you enjoy.
