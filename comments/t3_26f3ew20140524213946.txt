Here are a couple of things I've learned to get over my difficulties in socializing with other people.

First, people *love* to talk about themselves. Ask them questions if you feel like you're running out of things to say. Chances are, they'll have something at least mildly interesting to contribute to the conversation. Also, make sure your questions warrant more than a yes/no answer. 

Second, actively listen. Keep eye contact, make the appropriate noises ("Oh" or "Yeah, I know what you mean", etc.) at the right time. Listen for things you might have in common or things you have an opinion about. 

Third, take up a hobby. It could be painting, karate, cooking, drawing, model planes, gaming, movies, whatever. The more time you spend doing things for yourself, the more interesting you seem. Plus, hobbies are a great way to meet new people and learn new things. 

Hope this helps! I used to feel the same way, too. It took me a long time to get over some internal issues and learn how to really interact with others.
