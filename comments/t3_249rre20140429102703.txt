So for you too it's more about the underlying beliefs on sexuality rather than the practice itself? That's the impression I'm getting from most comments here. I wonder how other Christians would respond to this. Though it's a bit old fashioned,  I don't see any problems with this practice apart from the problems surrounding purity culture in general: 1) unfair pressure and shame directed towards girls and women, 2) no room for grace, forgiveness, and restoration, and 3) a complete lack of consideration for those who have been raped or abused.
