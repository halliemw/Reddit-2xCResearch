I was alone in a car at night and a man ran up to the car and banged on my window. It was incredibly frightening as it was dark and I was alone and he had others with him. It turns out he didn't like that I was parking in a loading zone but I explained to him I was picking up a disabled person and he backed off. This incidence really rattled me but I couldn't quite put my finger on why as the man didn't threaten me and ended up apologizing. My Fiancee was surprised that someone (not just a man, but especially someone who is physically larger and more intimidating than me) would approach a lone person like this in the dark. He said it's just not something that someone with any common sense would do because of course they're going to look more intimidating than normal in the dark and that approaching someone's car is getting to close and personal. 

I don't think you overreacted at all. I would react the same way you did.
