Ha! No, the problem is you're wearing something like [this](http://www.palmequipmenteurope.com/product/stikine). And under it, you're wearing something like [this](http://www.coloradokayak.com/IR-Union-Suit). Plus a few other layers. And on top of it, you're wearing a buoyancy aid and a spray deck. So, in order to pee, you have to completely strip, and it takes about fifteen minutes. And the same again to get everything back on. The guys just unzip their front flap and are good to go. It's also generally speaking really cold.
