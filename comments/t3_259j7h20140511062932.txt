I have 2 looks: pretty hair and bun. Pretty hair is out, heat straightened flowy etc. Bun is librarian style, low on the back of my head.

Pretty hair is dude friendly.  Guys talk to me. They watch me. I get hit on almost certainly if I combine with some make up.

I'm almost invisible with bun hair. It's like a mom look.

I only wear pretty hair in specific situations.  And almost never in a professional  context. I'm anxious enough without weird additional male attention. Pretty hair is pretty much asking to add weird conversations on transit, in line wherever.  Fuck that 90% of the time.

I'm mixed race but pass as white to white people.  Dudes tend to assume that I'm whatever race they are. Not sure it matters, but I wonder if being ambiguous looking is a factor. Or if other chicks have less dramatic experiences in general.
