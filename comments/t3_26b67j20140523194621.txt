A jeweler can (for very little money) easily re-size the ring to fit.  Going up in sizes is easy and doesn't damage the ring, it's going down in size that requires the ring to be cut.  But, the job would likely still be a problem.

> Also I'm not sure, but I don't know if it's necessary to specifically include transladies. It's nice to point out that they're included, but they're women, why wouldn't they be, you know? Anyone who knows more about this kind of thing might want to weigh in.

I did it just to be sure, I usually don't in 2x.  What with the increased focus here, I just figured it would be better to make sure any "new" people who weren't sure would feel free to comment.  Besides, in this question especially, their input is just as valuable to me as a born-female's would be.  Maybe it was too obvious...Oh, well.  Can't win in such a conundrum.
