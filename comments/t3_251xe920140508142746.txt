This is coming from a personal experience so please have a grain of salt handy. I went to a relationship counselor with my girlfriend. After a number of sessions she(the counselor) said it might be helpful to see someone individually and recommended another therapist for her to see alone. She was pretty general about why a person might find it helpful to do a one on one and it made sense. At a some point I found out that the therapist specializes in anger issues. It is my belief that anger was a large problem in our relationship (I have problems too but anger as an emotion seems to want to defend itself and can be a tough one to address)Anyway your throwing food and his reaction of throwing more food kind of hit a nerve. Also your saying "sometimes it will come off as me having an attitude" sounds like a statement that needs to be "unpacked" as they say. Again I'm seeing this through my personal lens so I'm predisposed to focus on anger issues. Going to a counselor together is likely a smart idea but I just thought I'd mention what happened in my case.
