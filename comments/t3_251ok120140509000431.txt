What I don't completely understand is whether the people who respond to me have reading problems or whether they just enjoy putting words in my mouth because it's easier than addressing my arguments. I'm not the one resorting to trite "you're doing _____" arguments.

Go to my history if you must. I defy you to find an instance where I'm rude or infantilized anybody.

Grow up. Or, at the very least, learn to address a person's arguments rather than playing spray and pray with talking points. Feel free to point out where what I've written supports what you freely assumed about me. I'll stick with you through the whole exercise, I promise.

Well, at the very least, I can now conclusively say that both sexes are equally poor at the internet. And, if people like you leave the community because you can't handle the mild heat in the kitchen, well, it's not a big loss.
