I've had my Mirena for a little over two months now and I've been able to lift and work out with no problems. Like someone else here said, the IUD is in your uterus, not your vaginal canal, so it won't get pushed out :-)

I love my Mirena! The only thing I don't like is my acne had come back, boo.

I had a pretty good experience with insertion. Yes, super uncomfortable, and it was slightly more challenging for my gyno since I've never had any babies and my cervix was not dilated. But otherwise it went smoothly, and now I'm laughing just thinking about the awkwardness of my appointment! If you want to hear my experience in detail just let me know and I'll pm you! :-)
