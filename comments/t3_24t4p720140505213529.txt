> Yet we also have extreme body dysmorphia. We hate anorexic models, but consider women with dress sizes below the national average to be "plus size". 

Well, the average American woman is plus-size. Just because it's average doesn't make it not big.

> Even more interesting, healthy food isn't the only contributor to fatness, yet it's the one we focus most on.

It's 80/90% diet, 20/10% exercise. It's almost impossible to lose weight without changing your diet.


There are a lot of things wrong with her article. I agree body shaming is bad, and people should mind their own business, but she also seems to link mostly dubious sources to back up her points at best. We don't need to hear how "average" she is to stop shaming her, if she was 500 lbs it still would not be anyone else's business. Nothing about someone ever gives you the right to bully them.
