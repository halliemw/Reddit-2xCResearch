Nonononono! /r/feminism is run by MRAs. The mods ban actual feminists, like, all the time. Not a good place to direct people interested in feminism. I also wouldn't necessarily recommend /r/feminisms, because that's pretty much just a trans-exclusive radical feminist circlejerk. 

/r/femmethoughtsfeminism is nice. They seem to be picking up a bit of steam lately, what with twox exploding. They're also on the radical feminist side of things, but with absolutely no transphobia allowed, so at least better than /r/feminisms. I'd ideally recommend linking someone to a nice friendly standard liberal feminist subreddit, but as far as I know, those don't... actually exist. Twox is actually where I've historically come to find more liberal feminist content. But like, whatever.
