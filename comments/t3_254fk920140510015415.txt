Don't know about the fetus, but I can tell you about the woman: I have Jeff and Barbara Galloway's book on running for women.  The gist of it is that if you are a runner, you can continue to exercise when you are pregnant, but it's a bad time to start if you are not.  

One you have the baby, you have to restart from couch potato levels.  It apparently wipes you out.
