Having gone to college in a small southern college town- I know your pain. One time a year at least there are anti-abortionists with their posters on campus- the posters with almost full term babies that get aborted- all bloody and missing limbs. I wish they couldn't protest on our campus. I worked for the Great American Condom Campaign at my school and women's sexual rights in SC are very limited. Wish religion and other people would stay out of it. 

Also, there are bible thumpers who condemn gays and premarital sex on our campus- I have some friends that are gay/lesbian and the rest of us started holding hands w the same sex to upset these terrible people.
