Good job mama!  Every kid is different. I have counseled women that have had a terrible time with one baby and zero issues with the next. (I was a LLL leader for a few years) You did your best and breastfeeding is only one leaf on the mothering tree. I highly recommend The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding next time you are pregnant. Its the breastfeeding bible.
