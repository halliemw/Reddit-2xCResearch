>I saw this little being, kicking it's little legs around, putting it's hand in front of it's face when the ultrasound technician would tap my belly to try to get it to move position, as if it was annoyed and just wanted to keep sleeping. I couldn't believe it. I have no idea, that at 12 weeks, I would see this little thing that is growing inside of me kicking and twirling around my uterus.

I understand and appreciate your elation. I don't want to take away from that at all. But you are projecting a LOT onto your developing fetus, who is not conscious. His motions do not reflect conscious thought  or intent; he is not capable of feeling annoyed or any other emotion. Everything he means to you is strictly in your head -- which means a woman with an unwanted pregnancy would be having a vastly different experience right now. Please, please take that into consideration.
