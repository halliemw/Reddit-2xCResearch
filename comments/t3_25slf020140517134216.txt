I worked in a garden center and it was all fine and dandy as long as I was helping people with flowers but I used to get a lot of "Could you get someone to load up 20 sacks of dirt?" Heaven forbid I get a cart and start loading up the bags. "Why are you doing that?! You are a GIRL. Get a MAN to do it!" I'd always look confused and say, "There isn't a man working right now, but if you wait two hours one might come in... Do you want the dirt or not?" I remember once someone told me to get help... so I called in the only other worker: another woman. That was awesome. I even had one woman tell me flat out that if I continued to lift heavy things (40lbs is heavy now? Really?) that my uterus would fall out and I'd no longer be able to have children. Right. 

Now I work in technology. I'm not shy about letting people know flat out when they are being sexist. I said something about being catcalled while working and the first thing out of my boss's mouth was 'what were you wearing.' I tore him a new one for that. There are times when my coworkers ignore my idea and then 'magically' come up with it later. I, however, keep detailed notes and will stop the meeting to ask how this is different than my idea and why the points that were problems before no longer are. After about a year of this and calling them out on it they will listen to me now, but damn that's been hard.
