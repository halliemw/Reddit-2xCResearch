Well, in my mind, there's no harm in getting a test just in case. That way if its negative you can at least have that peace of mind (or if it's positive you are now aware and can take whatever actions are necessary). However, stress can certainly delay or cause you to skip your period, it's happened to me plenty of times. 

As far as being concerned about judgement, just remind yourself that nobody who sees you knows your situation and it is likely you will never see them again. Just go in, grab what you need, and check out. Maybe go during a time of day the store isn't busy to minimize the chance of someone being rude.
