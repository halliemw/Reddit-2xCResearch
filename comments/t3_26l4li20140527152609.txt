One can sympathize with people who do terrible things, certainly but Elliot Rodgers was not a sympathetic figure. His loneliness was self-imposed, his lack of social skills didn't help but he had an incredible amount of disdain for everyone around him. He lacked the capacity for empathy which is evident from his writings and his treatment of his family. He very likely a sociopath who was determined to murder people for the smallest perceived slight. He was broken on a very fundamental level. A small but vocal contingent are sympathetic to an idealized version of him, one that would have been a normal well-adjusted kid if only girls hadn't been so mean to him, yet he was never rejected by the girls he hated so much, he never spoke to them. He sat behind them in class and because overwhelmed with rage and violence when facebook stalking revealed they had boyfriends. He was horrified when his mother suggested he get a job since work was beneath him, he was obsessed with acquiring wealth. The injustices he killed for were small and petty and he was a small and petty person who killed six innocent people.

I do not recall anyone being nearly as sympathetic to Adam Lanza as they are being now to Elliot Rodgers. When the sympathy is followed by misogynistic rants about how men should be guaranteed sex and women are bitches it's a problem. The fact it is a small minority is irrelevant if they have guns and are mentally unstable.
