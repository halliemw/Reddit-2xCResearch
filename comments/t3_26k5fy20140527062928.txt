The author is wrong.  The three reasons why we don't have enough doctors are:  medical school is ridiculously expensive, the residency requirement is long and hell, and the pay actually doesn't compensate for the very long educational pipeline and those costs, most doctors don't start earning until their 40s.

There are fewer people going into medicine than we need.  The issue isn't happening with the number of people dropping out, but with the number of people entering the pipeline.
