While I'm not OP, I can somewhat relate to her sentiments. The idea of occasionally not wanting to hear anything a guy has to say come from the idea that guys sometimes cannot empathize with certain situations. Sometimes I just want to rant about something that happened to me that men *may* not be able to relate to. I don't want logic. I don't want to have to explain why I felt the way I felt. I just want an audience that will immediately understand and empathize. 

Hypothetical Example:

I'm walking to my car in a parking garage late at night. Several yards behind me is a large man who is going in the same direction and getting closer to me. He enters the dark stairwell shortly after me, at which point I become highly anxious and fearful. Adrenaline is coursing at that point. Long story short, nothing happens... We each go to our separate cars. 

When I go to vent about this, here's what I don't want to hear: why were you so afraid? If nothing happened, what's the big deal anyway?

These are questions that will most likely be asked by someone who has never been in a similar situation, and most likely by someone who is not female. Men *may* not be able to empathize as well with my rant. 

TL;DR: the statement, perhaps, isn't "I don't want to hear anything that men have to say". Instead, it's "I only want to listen to someone who can relate to me at this exact moment, and since this is a women's issue I'm discussing, that means that most of my empathizers will not be male"
