From what it sounds like, you're probably giving him more credit than he deserves. I don't get the impression he is deliberately hurting her; it's more likely he just doesn't understand how hurtful and awkward his comments are. It's perfectly natural to be attracted to people outside your relationship (don't feel bad about that part, OP), but he should know better than to "joke" about it. OP, you should tell him how those comments make you feel and ask him not to joke about it around you. If he can't do that, then you will know this is a problem that is going to continue and you'll have to decide if you want to remain in a relationship with your bf if he can't filter himself or be actively considerate.
