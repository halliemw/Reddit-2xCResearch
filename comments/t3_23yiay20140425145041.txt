It was raining pretty consistently for the past several days here in Seattle, but today is actually disturbingly sunny! The temperature implies light jacket, but the sun beating down on you means sunscreen and a t shirt. I hate that, I'll take my days overcast and gloomy thankyouverymuch! *fake grumpyface*

I actually do enjoy a nice clear day for riding my motorcycle or sitting it the sun (slathered in SPF 50, of course) here and there, it's just overall I prefer overcast days.
