Edit 1: Sorry. I thought I was in r/askreddit. I have added 2XC to my filters so I won't make the mistake again. I'll leave my comment up so you can continue to downvote me. It's the only way I will learn. lol. 

Edit 2: -39 Wow. Please comment and tell me where I was being unreasonable. I must be taking crazy pills. I never said creepy kid was in the right. Is it because I said two instances of contact wasn't stalking? I did say his try at manipulation was wrong, didn't I?

Sounds like the weird kid has a crush on you and has tried twice to ask you out. This doesn't sound like stalking to me. He went to your house, the first time, to ask you out. Probably got the address from the internet or a friend of yours. Not hard to do. This turned in to a Skype conversation, where he expressed his feeling towards towards you. You didn't have those same feelings and went your separate ways. He is still crushing on you even though you rejected him. This explains the looks in class. 

Nine months later he tries to get you to care about him with some weird, creepy, suicide love poem through a text. This is a juvenile tactic to get the uninterested, interested. You shouldn't take it seriously.

This is far from stalking. A little creepy, but not stalking. Before you call the cops or get him in trouble, like others are suggesting, for thinking about you. You should put yourself in his shoes and think about how you would ask you out, if you were the weird one and had a crush. Have you never crushed on someone and they didn't know//feel the same way about it?
