There is, but because they are free, they hastily usher you out. I had to fight to have a prescription of canesten while listening to belittling. Last time the doctor gave me painkillers when my throat was swollen shut. I didn't have food money for the rest of the month after I went to a private clinic, where I got antibiotics to battle streptococcus. The point I'm making, is that the free clinic isn't my best option but I'm going to visit there tomorrow. I tried the second option after I read your comment, but the clinic advised me to visit the free one. Of course it is understandable.

Thank you for the glove advice. Today I wore these disposable rubber gloves, but they would just let the yeast thrive. I'll change them to cotton ones, I won't worry as much for others then. I haven't been really handsy with public things or my own.

Thanks for taking time off your day to write that, it is really nice of you. I'll try my best with everything but it is hard. Good that you feel okay with yourself and know how to work with your thingie, it's nice to know people are doing fine.
