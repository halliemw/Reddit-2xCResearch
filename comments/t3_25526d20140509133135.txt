I use a relatively gender neutral xbl name and I only use a mic in certain games or if I'm in a group I know, but my avatar is female (which, on xbl, isn't easily seen).  

I've been playing some Halo 4 lately, and in the past week I've been: asked out, asked to be added on facebook, called a "kunt newb" that must be "fat with a shitty job."  All of this, and I didn't use the mic once.

I also play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, and, in general, it's the opposite end of the spectrum. Everyone there is friendly and I have an awesome group of people I play with, men, women, from all over the world.
