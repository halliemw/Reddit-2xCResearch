I was pulled aside and told I smelled bad by teachers before, once in middle school, once in high school, it's a horrible thing to hear, especially if you're feeling depressed already. The most important thing is not to take it personally, some people sweat more than others and it doesn't mean you're a bad person! Especially if you sweat more on a regular basis, it can be really easy to miss. Clinical strength deodorant, doing multiple armpit washes per day (slather some antibacterial soap, even hand sanitizer, anything can work in a pinch) and even washing the area around your crotch/butt multiple times per day because sweat tends to accumulate there more. Also make sure you always wear cotton underwear so your vagina can breathe.
