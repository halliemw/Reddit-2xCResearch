I have been on your side of this issue in the past. The answer comes in two sides of the same coin.

First, these tasks are invisible to him because, like myself, you internally monitor and take care of them. He may do this with certain things in his life but perhaps he never had to take on these particular tasks so he has no opinion about them. In essence he is color blind to filling the pantry. He needs to learn, with your help to see the colors of how those tasks in the house function. So he must learn to identify things that need upkeep, and then must learn how to rectify them.

Next, this is all you. Part of the issue you have is that you aren't color blind. You "know to much", you can see the matrix code of living in a home. You must begin to willingly and actively commit to vocalizing your internal process to your SO. If you keep communicating that you need certain things in the house he will become familiar with them and begin to learn the process. Be sure to do this as if it's for your sake as well. Don't talk at him, talk with him. Teach it, don't demand it. Also certain items may need to be rationalized. Since he may not know their purpose. "It's important to have eggs, because in addition to breakfast, they also are the foundation of baking, breading, and other meals. Without them on hand we reduce our ability to prepare certain meals." See, its not just get eggs, its get egga because etc.  
So, understand that right now he is unable to identify the issues. Then actively include him in the process. Teach him by including him in how you think. No detail is useless. Lastly, I'm a man. Sorry for intruding.
