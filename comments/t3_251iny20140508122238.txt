Talking about something in the beginning of a relationship to establish boundaries is a mature and logical thing to do. 


Girl says:
"Hey, I don't like the idea of you watching porn. It makes me feel insecure. We can talk about it and I'll try to understand but in the past it just makes me feel bad." The girl is being open, honest and vulnerable by saying this because she is at a point where she likes you enough to need to establish what could cause damage in the future.

This gives the guy a chance to evaluate his own ideas and he can CHOOSE TO NOT PURSUE A RELATIONSHIP with that girl and pursue another, more suitable, mate. Buuut usually the guy says something like "Ugh, porn? no way! Who could be attracted to those desperate, disgusting bimbos!?" When he knows damn well it's a lie but doesn't want to be mature about the future of the relationship..

So many guys put-on and say they are all these things just because they want the girl then end up trying to change the girl or lie to her. Eventually everything surfaces and shit will fall apart. Just be honest. Don't want "the pussy" so much that you lie and cheat and manipulate us to get it, please. 

EDIT: exchange porn for literally anything (no gambling, must have job, must not be a shitty person, must love animals...) It's important to establish your morals and desires and it's OKAY to have standards.

TL:DR- Be honest at the start. It's better to have a doomed relationship end quickly than to drag it out with lies.
