Oh my GOD that sounds like my friend. Always stopping for food on the way to food and she thinks it'll make a funny, charming story and therefore we'll forgive her. She has derailed so many plans by pulling over for food or whatever and just thinks it's funny! 

I like your last sentence very much and it encapsulates where I'm trying to get to with her. I do appreciate the times we've had :) Going to have a think about whether it warrants a talk-talk. She's fully aware that she's the unreliable one but I don't think she gets that it's not funny any more or cool/respectful in an adult world, and her elementary school friends who used to put up with her being late for english class because she was getting extra food from the cafeteria during recess, aren't helping her with her adult relationships. 

I think it may be a good idea to talk to her because there may be a chance she can change - I'm not going to wait around for it but it could happen and that would benefit the other people in her life. She doesn't pull this kind of shit on her boyfriend, she's not chronically late to work, when her boyfriend's family invites her to dinner she's there on time (often cancels on us BECAUSE of such invites) - so she clearly knows how to show respect to certain people. I guess I'm just not high on that list. Anyway point being, she knows how to be on time... just not with everyone.. maybe with a talk she'll start to understand that she should treat others with the same respect.
