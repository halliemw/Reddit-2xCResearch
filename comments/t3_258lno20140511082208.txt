I had a very similar experience and I did just stop taking the pill, the nurse I talked to told me it was due to the pill but said I should keep taking it to prevent pregnancy which after having a three week period wasn't an issue. After I stopped the bleeding stopped right away. The mini pill is really sensitive so if you weren't exact on the times each day that may have caused it, I missed a vital day on the mixed pill.
