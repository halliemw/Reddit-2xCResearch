I feel like the "mutual weirdness" thing isn't true either, and it doesn't help to pretend it is.  There are some qualities that make it easier to get sex across the board.  

Also, I think this makes the mistake of acting like people are ashamed of being virgins just because of social pressure.  There's also something to be said for, people *want* to have sex, and if they're not having it, it makes sense to be upset about it.  If you say "it's OK to be a virgin!" and everyone comes out and agrees and doesn't make any more jokes about virgins (not that the people saying all this actually *would* stop making those jokes...), people who want to have sex and haven't will still feel bad about it.

But I agree that an issue is that people ascribe to the just world hypothesis when it comes to sex - that the amount of sex you get to have correlates to your moral worth (and not just red pillers...I see an element of this in the anti-"nice guy" stuff, acting like anyone who has trouble with the opposite sex must have some weird entitlement issues or be creepy/a fuckup/lazy/whatever)).
