I'm sorry your post got downvoted so much. I got what you were getting at. And I knew that you didn't mean every girl is like that. That wouldn't even make sense. I think some people on here just like to feel superior by "correcting" you instead of looking at the big picture. 

And yeah, I've been let down plenty of times too. It sucks a lot. I'm a good friend. I go to the end of the earth for all of them, I'm generous, I'm always available to do something, I'm into everything and anything. I don't understand why it's so hard to maintain friends. It's usually because they get a boyfriend and then just ignore me from then on. I already made the mistake of getting into a relationship, and then losing some friends. I will never do that again. There's always room for compromise, and time for everyone!

Also, don't ever feel bad about having mostly male friends though. There is always so much shame put onto girls for that, calling them "teases" or "sluts". HOW? A friend is a friend. We shouldn't have to feel guilty just because they're the opposite sex. It's ridiculous.
