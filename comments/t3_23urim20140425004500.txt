Deep breaths, you're going to be okay! Abortions are legal everywhere in Canada (up to how many weeks varies by province) and most clinics don't have the kind of picketing that the American ones do so it should be a less stressful experience in that regard. 

Look up a good women's health clinic near you and get yourself there as soon as you can. If you feel comfortable telling your parents, do so. If not, you don't need their consent for any medical procedures. I'm near Toronto and I know there are several clinics that are compassionate and confidential. 

Stay strong.
