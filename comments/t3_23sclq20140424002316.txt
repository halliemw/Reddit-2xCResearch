The damage that is caused when someone is attacked but manages to say no, to get their way out of it. Thankfully I cannot tell you the difference. In rape, I'm told, you feel as if all control is stripped of you, hatred of men evolves very quickly. In the event of saying no, of being able to pull one over on your attacker... 

You don't feel strong, you don't feel like you accomplished anything. You just feel like crying into a drink because how could you trust another relation after that of all things?
