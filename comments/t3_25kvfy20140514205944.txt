Oh yay! Since this is getting some positive feedback, I will go ahead and recommend Rule Brittania by Daphne du Maurier, since I was reminded of it again a day or so ago. It's a political satire that manages to be both witty and heartfelt, about a girl and her outlandish grandmother responding to a U.S. invasion of the U.K.
