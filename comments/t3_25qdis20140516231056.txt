Couldn't that just be "sick leave"? Or just let the woman work from home if she's having problems. We can do that these days, because we have these things called "computers" and "telephones." Some of these devices can even be used remotely. So why not just make it a sick day instead of a new category? Minimizes paperwork.

Either way, if a woman is having a hard time with that then she should get a break. I'm a guy, and I wouldn't want to have to deal with it (and I'm also a husband and a son, so I've seen my fair share . . . It never ceases to amaze me . . . Anyway . . . )

...So if a woman needs a break now and then because they're, um . . . 
-"on the rag"
-"visitng aunt flo"
-"staying in the 'red tent'"
Or "menstruating," as civilized people say

...Then they should be able to take that time to deal with it. But just make it personal time off, no more categories for things. Hell, I'm a white male and I took time off because my balls hurt one time, so what's fair is fair.

A different category would just add to the stigma of something that's natural. Basically bait for mysoginists.
