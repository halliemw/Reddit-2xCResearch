I think wishing her a happy mother's day is just fine:) She already loves her baby and likely considers herself a mother already.

As far as saying goodbye... I think just a simple "I love you, I'll talk to you later" is perfect. Maybe tell her that she's welcome to call you if she needs anything or if there's anything you can do to help before/during/after the birth. Congrats on being an almost-aunty!
