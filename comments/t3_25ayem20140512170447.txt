Although that's definitely a view I share, there's more to my story than you think. My dad was often physically abusive to both my mom and me, and this only decreased as he got older and less stressed out with finances and his career. My parents, as immigrants, also did not know as much about American culture or the language when they first came here, so I was on my own for homework and making new American friends. 
The older you are, the better you know yourself and can handle responsibility. There's no question about that.
