>What I meant was 'had the child been left unattended for 10 hours, that would probably count as being neglectful', at least since the child is a toddler.

Absolutely.  If a toddler had been left alone for even 10 minutes I would call that neglectful.  

>It doesn't really apply in this case anyway, since the OP hadn't actually gotten a 'specific' time frame for when the parent would be back.

Agreed.
