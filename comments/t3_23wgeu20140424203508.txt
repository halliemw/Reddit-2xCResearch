It's weird that I can't find much about it on the internet, but I remember reading the term "Perseus complex" years ago; it's supposed to describe men who fall for women whom they hope to somehow "save" with their love, like Perseus in Greek mythology rescuing Andromeda from a sea monster. I read about it in a biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. She was a very successful poet but a complete shut-in when Robert Browning sought her out and convinced her to elope with him.  Anyway, even if a relationship begins that way--one person romantically objectifies some aspect of the other--with time together, people who are good partners together develop deeper, richer profiles of one another and transcend that initial label.  
  
For another example of a fetish turned into complex affection, there's a new documentary making the rounds called "[Seeking Asian Female](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/seeking-asian-female/film.html)."  It's about a white guy who spends years approaching Asian women on-line. When he finally finds a Chinese woman willing to come to the States and marry him, he discovers that in order to make their relationship viable, he has to completely change his ideas about the role he expects her to play because his stereotyped fantasies did not prepare him for interacting meaningfully with a real woman.  
  
So I think you're totally right that this model of your identity and experience is reductive to the point of falsehood. It does you an offensive disservice. Whether he can move past his attachment to that branding and take you on your own terms--or whether you even want to let him try--is something you guys may have to figure out. But you definitely deserve to be loved for your strengths, vulnerabilities be damned.
