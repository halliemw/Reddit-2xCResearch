Along with my best wishes, I offer you a trick I used after my own abdominal surgery in order to get out of bed without agony.   When you're flat on your back, put your hand behind each thigh and rock back and forth a bit, very gently, then kind of pull yourself up SLOWLY using your arms instead of your abs.  This takes off a lot of the pressure off your stitches.
