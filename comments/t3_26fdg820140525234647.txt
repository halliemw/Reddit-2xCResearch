I don't know how I am alive today with all the dumb shit I get myself into. Same as you I had a very sheltered life but you put yourself out there get into some scrapes along the way and learn some lessons. 

Attitude is everything. If you are in something dicey you will be surprised how calm you can make yourself. Read up about the flight or fight response and you will be better prepared to recognize your own innate reactions.  Own the situation. Be supremely confident that you can handle it and learn the difference between deescalating a situation and when to go full on retard.
