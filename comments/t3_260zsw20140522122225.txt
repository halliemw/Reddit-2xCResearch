I do think many of the people on this thread would find my book helpful. It actually came out in hardback last October http://www.amazon.com/Being-Both-Embracing-Religions-Interfaith/dp/0807013196/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371725968&sr=8-1&keywords=susan+katz+miller. Also, here's a conversation I had with atheist author Chris Stedman on the subject of theists and atheists in relationships http://chrisstedman.religionnews.com/2014/02/12/can-atheists-theists-intermarry-susan-katz-miller-interfaith-families/. And also, the Christian partner in this (or any interfaith) relationship might be interested in another new book written by a Baptist minister married to a Hindu: Saffron Cross http://www.amazon.com/Saffron-Cross-Unlikely-Christian-Minister/dp/1935205161.
