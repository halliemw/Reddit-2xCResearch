I've asked my bf to go to counseling - because I find counseling (for myself) to be helpful. He has not had positive experiences and is therefore not at all comfortable with the idea. I think scheduling an appointment without talking about it with your partner sounds kind of aggressive - and if you haven't both decided that this is a good step for you, it's going to be a difficult journey. You can't force someone to go, and it is something that only really helps if you're open to it.
It's not overreacting to want to go - or to talk about it - but it's a little much to make the decision on your own for both of you.  If it's something you choose to do for you on your own - there is certainly stuff you can work on with a therapist to guide your end of these conversations better, and that would also be a good choice.
