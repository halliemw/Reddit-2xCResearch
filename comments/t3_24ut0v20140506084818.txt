Just because you didn't mean for it to be offensive doesn't mean it wasn't. Wishing rape upon something/someone is pretty jarring, especially considering that a lot of women come here for support after having experiences with sexual assault. Referencing rape as a punishment or response to something, something you can deserve, do you see where I'm going with this? That's the way it comes off from what you describe and it's a bad message. I don't think it's unfair that it was removed.
