I have always had a lower stomach fat blob for my whole life. This is partially genetic! I have seen tons of women with far more body fat with less of a stomach than I have had. I have found that gaining more muscle mass throughout my body has magically helped. I don't know exactly why. My diet has changed a bit to include significantly more protein but that's the only change. Also my stomach pooch is still here but it's smaller. I get fluctuations I guess but it seems just to be shitty diet=more fat on stomach. Also since I'm slim (as are you) when I eat my stomach get noticeably bigger which is a big bummer but oh well.
