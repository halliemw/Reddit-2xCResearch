Wow, there is so much here in common with my situation. I am sorry you had to go through all of that as well.

You're right, I do feel stupid and beat myself up. I still have feelings of guilt, regret & doubts even now, three months later. I need to stop constantly wondering whether it was my fault & if I could have prevented it. Or constantly asking myself if I turned him this way.

Its comforting to hear someone has been in the same situation(not that I don't feel for you, of course)- with the whole him leaving you. I was always told they will beg for your mercy and youd take them back and the abuse would continue, so I was so hurt and confused when he left me because I always thought it didn't go that way. & always wondering "if he left because he cared, why did he hurt me so bad"

Thats so true, I was so blinded when I was in it. I would always tell myself & him "the day you punch me will be the day its done forever" and he'd say "Id never do that to you." Then when the situation arises and the heart gets involved, all logic & reasoning completely fly out the window to make room for feeling & emotion. Hindsight IS 20/20. When I reminisce I cannot believe how long I let myself be miserable. I'd always give my best friend shit for dating a guy who was rude to her, without in a million years thinking I'd let a guy doing everything he did to me.

Thank you for your kind words & support, they really helped. I am glad you are out of that situation, it truly is awful and no way to live.
