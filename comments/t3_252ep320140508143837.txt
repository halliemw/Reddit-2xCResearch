I got mine at 11. It was the month before my family was moving to a new city. The entire house was in the process of being thrown out and packed away and I woke up in the morning and, well...

I knew what was happening anyway. My mom had given me a book on the subject so I knew immediately what was going on. I went and told her what was up and she sighed, said something about how of course I would start during the month we had to move, and then she went to the bathroom and dug up some decade-old pads that she'd been saving for me.

All in all, it was relatively stress-free.
