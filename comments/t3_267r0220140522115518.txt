My worries are that it's something autoimmue that might have been triggered by the Mirena/having a foreign body in your body. I could entirely be reaching on that...but we have no history (that I know of) of autoimmune issues in my family.

I'm actually almost hoping that the blood test my doctor just ordered will at least give me SOME clue to what's up.
