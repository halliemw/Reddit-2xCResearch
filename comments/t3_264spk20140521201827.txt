I'm glad you could get the support you need as an adult, I'm sorry your mom wasn't helpful when you needed it as a teenager. I definitely wasn't disagreeing with your point! It's great to provide therapy for kids who need it when they're open to trying it and think it can help. It's just not useful to force someone to go when they're not open. I had therapy later (during college) voluntarily that was much more effective, but being forced to go at 14 just made me more stubbornly convinced that it was useless for a while.
