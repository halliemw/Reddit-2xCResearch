Are you American by the way? When I was in the US I noticed that a lot of women were like this. I felt more scared of that really because you never really knew where you stood and if they meant what they were saying. They would say things just to please the conversation rather than say how they really felt. Personally I find that way of being very frustrating and I find it difficult to trust those types of people.

I'm from the UK and I know that I'm more direct than most people but other women usually respect this and it's mostly men that have a problem with it.
