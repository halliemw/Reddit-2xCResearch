Intellectually speaking, it's reasonable to say that the government shouldn't outlaw something, but that you still think it's a bad idea or have moral objections to it.  Any religious person who believes in freedom of religion would fall into this camp, for instance (about believing something other than they do).

Cruel and abusive attacks are a completely different matter, of course.  I just think that there's a viable intellectual position which we shouldn't ignore.
