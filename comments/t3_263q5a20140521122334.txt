Sadly my insurance didn't cover any of it.  I had to pay the surgeon in full with a check.  I saved up, though, all during HS for it.  I had it done the summer I graduated HS, and right when I turned 18.

Don't mind what other people think, you can't please everyone.  And if this make you happy then that is all that matters.  I was the same way with plastic surgery.  I saved for it, but I was on the fence about it.  I kept thinking, what if I don't like it?  Will I look completely different? Too different? 

I don't regret it at all.  It was a big decision, both emotionally and financially, but I believe it was entirely worth it.
