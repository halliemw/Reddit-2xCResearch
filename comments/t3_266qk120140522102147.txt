I feel conflicted about this. On the one hand I'm glad she got away, on the other, she endangered other people by driving drunk. I think she did everything right, but I also don't think giving a pass on drunk driving is setting an acceptable judicial precedent.

OP quoted one of the dissenting justices:

>“that the necessity defense is unavailable not only in cases of domestic abuse, but also in cases in which a victim’s seeking refuge from a violent physical or sexual assault or kidnapping, and the court’s decision thus discourages those individuals from seeking shelter in a motor vehicle as well”

I don't think this ruling actually negates the necessity defense, I think it says that the necessity defense is not carte blanche to take actions that endanger other people. But the potential to discourage people from seeking refuge from abuse is the a real concern here. I really don't think there's a good ruling here; to me it's a question of the lesser evil, and I'm really not sure which ruling is the lesser evil here.
