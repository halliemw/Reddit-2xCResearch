 I do 't believe it for a second he was in any way confused about it. He took advantage of an ideal creep situation:

* you were in a group, and everyone had already made a mental image of each other as almost friends/normal people
* you were drunk enough to slurr and therefore anything you would have brought up would be easily combated with "are you sure you didn't imagine it?" Your believability was questionable
* it was blatant and overt and therefore hard to believe. BECAUSE it was blatant and overt. So ideal to do as anyone, upon finding out, would even try to excuse it as some accident plus your perception being off by alcohol. 
* you mention he was doing it repeatedly and even "kneading". Yeah, not an accident. Deliberate. Deliberate without any invitation. Don't even doubt yourself. 

Everyone imagines creeps as idiots. It's true , we assume they are unintelligent and obvious. But if you are a creep your goal is to not get outed. It's not to grab a strange sober person on the street. It's to grab one that you know who is drunk. Heck, if I was a creep I would recreate the situation with the OP. A drunk person may not notice, may not remember the next say and be too intimidated to say anything about it.
