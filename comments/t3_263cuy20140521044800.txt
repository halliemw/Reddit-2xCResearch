We've all been there at some point.

Have you tried things like meetup.com? It can be a bit daunting though so it's understandable.

Maybe you could invite one of your acquaintances along with you and try something new? I've found that doing an activity stops it from being as awkward as it might be usually.

Also, do you like video games? It's surprisingly easy to make friends on things like Mumble or by joining clans by playing games with people.
