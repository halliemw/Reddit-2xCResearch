Are you sure your undies are 100% cotton? I always try to buy cotton but most panties these days have at least 10% something else. Also, it is possible to suddenly develop an allergy to something you've been using for a long time. I would switch to a free and clear detergent just in case. You might also want to try summer's eve or something like it. I switched a while back form regular soap and it has made things more comfortable. Is there itching? If there is it is likely an allergy, whether a new one to products you have been using or if you're using a new product. In that case I would look into switching to hypoallergenic products. Of course, it is perfectly within in your rights to demand a better answer from you doctor or even get a second opinion. Hope this helps.
