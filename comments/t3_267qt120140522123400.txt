Well preparedness is great, really I'm not discouraging any of it. I was more replying to the fact that plan b is something you have to take within 72 hours, and amazon doesn't offer prime shipping for it. And to the person who said thy don't come in a 10 pack, I know that too, I've a scare with an ex before and had to use it. I'm all for the idea of it, and having it on hand is great, accidents happen whether it's a broken condom or whatever, but I see it as a last resort. I can imagine people throwing autism to the wind and saying "fuck it I have a buck up plan at home." I wasn't discouraging it, I think it's great, what I said was a poor way of saying they need Prime shipping for a product like this.
