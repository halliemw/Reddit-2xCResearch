We agree that the past 24 hours have been painfully awful.

Unfortunately, we can't yet draw any conclusions about how much of that is the new baseline we'll see as a default subreddit, and how much of that is brigading related to the announcement.  Currently, the top posts on several subreddits who don't like us are related to /r/TwoXChromosomes becoming a default sub.  This is bringing in brigades, trolls and jerks on mass from these subreddits.  We'll have a much better idea of what to expect in the next several days.

We're giving being a default subreddit a good-faith effort, which means operating on the assumption that we can make this work long-term.  No decision is ever irreversible, but if we give a set timeline like "if things aren't peachy keen in *n* days, then we'll back out" we'll only be encouraging opponents inside the subreddit and out to spend those days doing their best to *make us* regret our decision.
