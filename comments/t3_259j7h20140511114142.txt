Ever since I got short hair I've experienced.. weirder street harassment, for sure. I've never been the most conventionally attractive woman - I distinctly recall being followed/stalked down a street by a car full of dudes yelling "YEAH YOU UGLY" when I was 15 years old - so I guess I don't get the brunt of a lot of it, though since I've lost weight I do attract a different level of attention. Never felt threatened, though, thank god

However, EVERY DAMN PERSON EVER seems to have some opinion my relatively butch hair now. I swear. My favorite thing that's been yelled at me on the street now is "SIR, YOU LOOK LIKE A LESBIAN"

let's parse that statement

1. If I'm a man, you just said I look masculine, so.. thanks?

2. If I'm a lesbian.. well, okay?

3. I am bokowolf, bokowolf is bokowolf and does not trouble themselves with the opinions of drunk fools in cars. Also bokowolf is fabulous


People are weirdo jerks and will find any excuse or way to manifest their weirdo jerkness I suppose
