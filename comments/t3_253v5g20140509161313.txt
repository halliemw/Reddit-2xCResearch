Late to the party but I just want to say I am so, so, so sorry you're going through this. That's a trifecta of suck. 

The worst UTI I ever had, I was literally peeing red. It helped me feel a lot more human to just sit in a hot bath. Same for yeast infections. Also hangovers. Maybe that will help you?

HUGS.
