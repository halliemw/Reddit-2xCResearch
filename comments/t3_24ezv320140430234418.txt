I didn't get anything and mine was merely uncomfortable, not notably painful. Nulliparous and 21 years old at time of insertion. I've had it 4 years now with no issues.

The insertion, pain-wise, was maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10, and I've had a pretty wide array of pain in my life. Moderate cramping for two days. Periods disappeared. It's been ~magical~.

Since my 5 years is coming up, I'm debating between another IUD and a partial hysterectomy if I could get approved for it.
