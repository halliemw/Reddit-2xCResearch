I definitely agree with everyone else that you should not get involved. This is not your problem and you need to take care of yourself. But I since you mentioned concern for Sheri, I want to offer 1 piece of advice.

Write her a letter or print out this post about what he has done to you. Something written will allow distance for yourself and Roger/Sheri. Even if he has changed or is trying to change, it can help her to know what he has done in the past. Explain the pain he put you through and how you now want nothing to do with him. Have Jennifer deliver the note and state that this is the last and only communication you will ever have with Sheri. It is not your responsibility to deal with Roger or to warn Sheri but since you mentioned concern, this is one way to let her know what he is capable of without getting involved any further.
