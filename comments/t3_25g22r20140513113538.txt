As a guy who has never had the same visceral "EW PERIODS!" reaction that a lot of guys do (not trying to say I'm a special snowflake, just qualifying my response here), I had the same mild cringe followed by a hearty chuckle. This coming from a guy who actually had to clean up a whole mess of period blood in the ER not two days ago and didn't blink the slightest other than to think "aw I hope whoever did that is ok."
