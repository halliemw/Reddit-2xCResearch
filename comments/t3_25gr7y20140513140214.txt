Does she understand that if she just pretends nothing is wrong, this can lead to cervical cancer down the road? 

I understand *why* she initially experienced all of those negative feelings, but HPV is nearly an inevitability for a sexually active person today, and is not worth continuing to nurture those feelings over. The earlier it's caught, the easier it is to get rid of. She can't really say that the western medical system isn't set up to make people healthy when she is the one who isn't taking proper steps to make herself fully healthy again.

Pap smears suck, colposcopies suck, and the procedures used to get rid of the abnormal cervical cells aren't too fun either (I had the LEEP in September). But I'm willing to bet that cervical cancer sucks way worse, and she is being irresponsible to her own body and to yours by intentionally not pursuing a fairly simple treatment.

If she doesn't like her doctor, you can encourage her to find a new one that she will be comfortable with and you can go with her to appointments if you're both comfortable with that, but you can't force her to follow through on any of this. I wouldn't recommend continuing to have sex with her if she continues to refuse to get a common STD treated, as at least one of you needs to be looking out for your own health.
