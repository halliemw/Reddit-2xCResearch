Or maybe she won't... We can't decide other people's priorities for them, even when it's hurtful that we don't seem to make the cut. BUT you can certainly give her the chance to change this - and clearly let her know how it affects YOU, in case any of that has fallen under the radar. She may (benefit of the doubt) just assume that folks know she's eternally a "maybe" to outings, and that this is fine with everyone. 
I was totally not amused by waiting around for this friend to call and tell us where she was (late) or ask for directions from wherever she was coming from (late), leaving us standing around places waiting so we wouldn't start the process again by having her find us somewhere else. We also spent a half hour looking for her one night when she did show up, because she had decided people were too much and had gone to sit outside the bar reading manga (sat night, in the city) - did not communicate this to anyone. Sigh. I opted out of dealing with this lack of consideration sooner than some mutual friends, who continued to deal with the same thing - and were permanently frustrated or let down.  It is possible in your situation that if you stop putting in the effort, that will sort of be the end of it... because it doesn't sound like she's doing much on her end. Maybe that's ok :)
