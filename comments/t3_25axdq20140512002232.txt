I can't help but wonder if some of the serial downvoting came about not simply because the sub became default, but because so much attention was brought by those immediately complaining about it. There would have been an influx regardless, but I happen to think screaming "We hate this and don't want people here," would cause the instant response of the juvenile-minded, "You're afriad we'll fuck it up... okay, here we come!" Everyone is entitled to their opinion about whether or not it was a mistake, but it doesn't seem as though it has occurred to anyone that drawing MORE attention might actually be adding to the problem.
