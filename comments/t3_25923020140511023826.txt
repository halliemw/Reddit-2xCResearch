Thank you for writing this post and I hope more people sees it, since this topic is a norm and rarely spoken about. I'm in the exact same boat as you, but I'm asian... which means I'm hairier than most of the men and I'm even hairier than my dad (oh genetics, I love you). I have as you hair everywhere, mention any body part and I have hair there. This has made me very very self consious over the years. I have a hard time revealing my body during the warmer days. My legs and stomach has payed the price for shaving for years and my hair is getting longer as well... Even though I know that being hairy is absolutely normal, it is just so hard accepting yourself when people around you and the media (and myself for that matter) tells you otherwise... But I am working on it : )
