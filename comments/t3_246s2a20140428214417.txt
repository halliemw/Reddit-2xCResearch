I was also really confused about why they changed Tris's fear of intamacy to fear of sexual assault. It completely changes her character. What book-Tris is afraid of if physical intimacy with another person, partially due to the crazy-strict rules about physical affection in her home district. She never worries that Four will force anything on her. She is not afraid of rape, she is afraid of the closeness of consensual sex.

That was my take anyway.
