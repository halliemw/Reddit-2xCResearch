> I feel especially responsible for being proactive about issues like this

I feel the same way because I have younger sisters! It really makes me feel like I have to "cut a path" so I can tell them my experiences with odd online behavior so that they don't have to suffer from it.

I feel that you will be a great teacher and are already are very mature and responsible person! (Coming from someone who is only in their 20s as well, haha.)
