I disagree. I think that this community, as it was, was an excellent niche subreddit, but making it a default cosigns the idea that women are a special-interest group. It ghetto-izes women and makes it more likely that topics that would have otherwise been appropriately submitted to larger, more established default (read: catch-all) subs (/r/news, /r/pics, etc.) will now be submitted here, as the "women's interest appropriate" subreddit.

One subbreddit's commenting culture cannot overtake the site as a whole and turn it into a better place; users coming from their main page often don't even realize where they are (or don't care), and don't respect the community in which they are participating - which is why default subs become such sludgefests - they're all part of a much, much larger mass, and lose their subreddit-specific culture/identities to that diluting onslaught. It's the [eternal september](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) of new accounts - users who are unfamiliar not only with the subreddit, but with reddit itself. 

Combine that with the mentality that this subreddit is now an excellent place to take out your frustrations on anyone (and there are a lot of us) daring to identify as a woman (or Flying-Spaghetti-Monster-help-you, anything outside the binary) on the internet, and it's going to be a **very** rough time. I worry, too, for those even smaller communities linked in the sidebar, who certainly didn't ask for this, and will undoubtedly get secondary fallout.

I'm not abandoning ship - that helps no one - but making TwoX a default was a serious breach of trust, and a major, major mistake. Our mods have a long history of setting incredibly high standards for themselves, and I respect them immensely. I just *do not like this.*
