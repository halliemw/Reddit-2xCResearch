I'm in no way wanting to police your body, but in terms of eating what I want, I've found that an IIFYM plan (if it fits your macros) has worked well for me. Everyone understands the principle of burning more calories than you consume to stimulate the loss of fat, but IIFYM takes into account how much protein, carbohydrate, and fat your body needs each day and says, essentially, that as long as you're meeting your macronutrient goals each day (whether that goal is a caloric surplus for weight gain or a caloric deficit for weight loss), it doesn't matter what you eat. Obviously like you said, everything in moderation, but that might be a topic of interest to you.
