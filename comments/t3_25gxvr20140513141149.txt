I think a strong female character has to adopt some of the traits normally attributed to our favorite masculine characters, but without necessarily adopting masculinity. I agree that a female character shouldn't be considered so purely because she is a lead. "Strong" derives from her character not just being prominent, but from relateable qualities and heroic manner. She should keep her promises, follow her own moral authority, protect people she cares for and dare to take risks to achieve her goals. 

There's some more subtle expectations that color how a woman should behave and how a man should behave, but I think (hope?) these can be subverted if the core of the character matches up to a heroic archetype.
