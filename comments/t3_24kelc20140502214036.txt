It is also pretty important to note that in areas directly impacted by western imperialism and neo-imperialism, ideological fights take place very immediately and visibly on women's bodies. Very intense Islamist restrictions for women are fundamentally an invention of the past 150 years, in response to western imperialist expansions and the accompanying cultural dominance of understandings of "orientals." 

When discussing Iran under the shah and post-revolution, we must remember that the state in both cases violently enforced a particular dress for women in public-just happening to be the opposite of one another.  There are several instances of women getting acid thrown at them for going out veiled, and so huge numbers of women stayed home the vast majority of the time because they wouldn't leave the house uncovered. Not helpful, and not good for women. 

The state never actually cared about women's empowerment-it just wanted to enforce a particular ideology onto the bodies of women.
