Flying always screws up my periods. If I'm having my period, it will delay it for a few days. If I'm expecting my period, it will either start it or delay it. This past month, I flew during ovulation and it delayed THAT, resetting my cycle from its typical 26 days to 35 days. 

I have no idea what it is about airplanes. It happens even on short flights, and even when I stay in the same time zone.
