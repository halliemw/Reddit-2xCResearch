I recommend visiting a gynecologist, might as well get a pap smear and well-woman check while you're at it? If you don't have insurance Planned Parenthood or someplace similar is where I'd go first. I'm not sure what age exactly they now recommend starting exams but IIRC 19 is around the recommended age.
