One thing that can help at least from the infections stand point, especially if you bounce between BV and yeast infections (happened to me back in the day when I started on OCP's-super frustrating) is to try a pH balancer. I think the one at the drug store is called repHresh or something like that.  Basically it acidifies the vaginal environment and helps prevent those infections which are more like overgrowths of naturally occuring flora.  Alternatively, you could make yourself boric acid suppositories.  Boric acid (a powder) can be found at the drug store and then get the little pill shells from supersupplements or something like that and make them yourself.  I used the drug store ones first and they definitely helped! but were kind of expensive for regular use so then I started making my own.  Put in at night before you go to bed to start and then you can space out.   You probably don't have do it every night and you'll figure out a pattern that works for you.  Worth a shot!
