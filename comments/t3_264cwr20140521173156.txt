>If you didn't have issue with something before, don't let a bunch of other people in different situations make you "think you should take issue" with anything. 

You should perhaps read up on the psychology of abusers and abuse victims. 

There are people who have been brutally raped and beaten by lovers and family members and who don't think it's wrong because they've never heard anyone say it's wrong.

Obviously don't just change your mind on a dime every time you hear something from a group of people, but if you hear something contrary to what you thought before, it's often worth pondering and researching if appropriate.
