I'd imagine there's a lot more women who browse without commenting. Still a "minority" going by base statistics, but I can easily see why women would be dissuaded from commenting with such quality trends like "no GW posts to see here guys ;) ;) ;)" or "this picture has a woman/body part that looks female in it, let's discuss it despite it not being the subject of the picture at all". 

I'm hoping it'll chill out soon.
