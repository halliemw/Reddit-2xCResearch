He tries to get you pregnant through deception, knowing you don't want more children, then turns around and says he won't let you get an abortion? He won't LET you? What's he going to do, tie you to a chair for nine months? Oh yeah, it's "not what he wants". Yeah, fuck him and what he wants. He shouldn't have the privilege of having his wants acknowledged anymore. This is a mortifying situation and he sounds like a manipulative, abusive creepy-creep. OP, please drop this hot potato and run for the hills. Stay safe.
