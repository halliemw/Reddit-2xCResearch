Let me open with, "I am a dude."  And when I say that I mean that I am completely male: just alpha enough to enjoy myself but not be an egotistical ass.  I love the female form in all of it's phases.  I am old enough to realize the beauty in most all aspects of the female form.  And let me say that I have never been with a woman and not been attracted to every part of her.  If you have had male partners that were actually low enough to make any negative statements about your physicality I truly hope that you pointed out their embarrassing lack of manhood and laughed them out of the bedroom/backseat/changing room at Macy's.  Sure posture is a plus but it's a plus for male and female alike.  It is symbolic of self confidence which adds attraction to anyone.  Female nudity is ALWAYS sexy.  Every woman I have ever been attracted to was even more attractive if she decided to bless me with naked attentions.  Maybe instead of taking a second look at yourself you should take a second look at whatever criteria you use in picking a guy.
