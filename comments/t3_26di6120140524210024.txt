Ok these may or may not work for you, but I play roller derby and in roller derby camel toe can be a real issue as many women like to bout in tight booty shorts. There is a company called Hex Chromosome that makes shorts that have "Anti-Camel Toe Technology". The crotch of the shorts have really unique stitching that is supposed to camouflage camel toe. I wear them (as a woman with a long torso, I fight the good camel toe fight on a regular basis) and have never had any issues with lady bits peaking out where they shouldn't. 
[Here's a pair](http://shop.derbyvilleonline.com/collections/shorts-booty-shorts/products/hex-chromosome-karoline-stripe-bike-short). They have all kinds of lengths and rises and colors and styles so you could wear these under a pair of shorts or even wear them alone if you find that they camouflage any appearance of a camel toe. 

They have a website www.hexchromosome.com but apparently its undergoing maintenance. 

I hope this helps! Keep fighting the good camel toe fight!
