I don't really know how to specifically answer your question, as you were vague about your health issues, but I think "becoming a person" is relative to what you want out of life. To me, being a  real person is maintaining a job and friendships. My best advice is to figure out what you want out of life and grab it. Want to learn how to cook? Watch some Rachel Ray Thirty Minute Meals and attempt the easier ones. Want to get a better job? Start looking. Want to lose weight? Join myfitnesspal. Want a relationship? Join a singles group. 

For anything you want out of life, just identify it and take small steps to reach your goal! You can do it!
