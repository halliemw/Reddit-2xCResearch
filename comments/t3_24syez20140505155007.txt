The diva cup is shaped totally different than the softcups, and sits in your body differently.  I tried the softcups before I tried the diva cup because I wanted an alternative to tampons.  They didn't work for me.  They felt too big and any time I sneezed or get to the bathroom they would dislodge.  Trying to wedge it back behind my pubic bone just didn't work.

The diva cup, on the other hand, is shaped  more like a little goblet and sits lower in your vagina.  You don't have to wedge it behind your pubic bone.  The walls of your vagina are what hold it in.  I had to cut the stem off the diva cup because it sits low enough in me that the stem pokes me.  So I'd say it is worth trying... they are totally different experiences. I love my diva cup even though I hated the softcups.
