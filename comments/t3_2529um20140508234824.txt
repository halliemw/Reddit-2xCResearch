There is plenty of room for me to sympathize and try to rationalize this event. But re-rationalizing why you didn't see this or why this even happened won't make it better. As a fellow female I also tend to over analyze and dwell on the past, but please hear me out:

My advice is simple- Motherfucking rally like the motherfucking intelligent, sexy boss that you are. 

You won't just get your confidence back you have to take it (or sometimes fake it) until it happens. Push yourself at the gym, in your daily life, in school, in work. Step out of your comfort zones and do new things. Rejection and failure will happen - and learn that this is fantastic no matter how embarrassing or disappointing it may feel because you are living and you are growing. Stop getting down on yourself, or in some ways re-consuming this self doubt, it's not going to help you. In this instance it's time to fuel it into anger and that anger to self improvement (mentally, physically whatever - just focus on you). That sexy, smart lady isn't some far off dream - it's you - it's now- you just got to own it. It will be hard and you will have good and bad days, but love yourself and don't let one person's rejection suffocate that beautiful self confidence that you are capable of.
