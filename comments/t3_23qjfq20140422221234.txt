It is so frustrating! I'm so mad but then I feel guilty for being mad at him because he is injured!

The worst is that he often feels like crap after the workout, which one would think would motivate him to STOP. But he claims the working out will increase blood flow to his brain which will speed healing. Umm...NOPE.

I'm definitely forever screaming, although he's so calm most of the time that he just calmly tells me not to worry. As much as it sounds tacky, I'm literally thinking of crying and threatening to leave even!
