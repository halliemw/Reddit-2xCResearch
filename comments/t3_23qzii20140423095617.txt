Wow, thank you for your concern. I am feeling pretty terrible at the moment to be honest. I woke up about an hour ago (after falling asleep around 5am) and pretty much told him what I did, and that I wanted him to go. I've been crying my eyes out ever since and have a raging headache. But your comment was a nice, brief moment out of this hell.
