I get this a lot! Didn't help being a bartender! My usual response, "Don't tell me what to do!" Unless I was on the other side of the bar. Then I would usually unload on them. "What is wrong with you, that you need constant affirmation from people? I think you need to stop and take a good look at yourself and figure out why you need to get constant positive reactions from people around you!"
