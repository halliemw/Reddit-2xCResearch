I wish, but I live with my SO and my parents are against it. They're extremely "Christian" and think my SO and I are bad influences. It's okay for them to beat their kids, but God forbid I cohabitate with someone I've been dating for four years. 

They won't even let the kids hang out with me anymore. Tim got to go to the skating rink with me once, under the condition that our dad was there the whole time. I would understand if I'd been addicted to cocaine or something and they wanted to keep the kids away from me, but I've done nothing wrong. It's rant upsetting. But thankfully they're still allowed to call me.
