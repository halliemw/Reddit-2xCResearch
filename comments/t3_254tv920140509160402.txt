Semi-related, but as a kid when we had sex ed and shit it bothered me that they basically tried to keep periods secret from the boys.  Someone would ask and they'd be like "oh you don't have to know", or "that's just for girls, don't worry about it", and I remember thinking, wtf it's probably still good info to have...
