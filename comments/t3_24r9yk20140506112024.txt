Thanks for posting this. I've been spending a little too much time in /r/relationship_advice and reading about so many men who do scumbag things to their SOs. It's starting to make me be paranoid about my absolutely WONDERFUL husband when I have absolutely no reason to be. I think I'm going to unsubscribe from that sub. 

Again, thanks so much for the reminder that some men are amazing. I happen to be married to one of them.
