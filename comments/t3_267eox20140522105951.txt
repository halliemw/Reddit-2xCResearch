> Some studies have suggested that parent shaping as a socializing factor has little impact on a childâ€™s sex role development (Lytton & Romney, 1991; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1980).

even from a paper that is supporting this, it's not exactly a fact. I don't think the OP's link can say it like it's always true.
