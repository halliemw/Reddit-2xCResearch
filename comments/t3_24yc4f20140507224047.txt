The fertility awareness method should never be used (without a backup method) by someone who is 100% sure they don't want a child imo.  It's just too unreliable.  Period.

Take it from someone who's super religious parents conceived their last two children by accident using the method.  And trust me, they were trying their hardest not to get pregnant.
