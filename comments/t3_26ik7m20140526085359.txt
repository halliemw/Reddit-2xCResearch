To me, the difference is that ribs and bellies are considered acceptable in public in Western culture, though of course not in all situations, while butts and crotches aren't or are relegated specifically to certain beaches or areas. 

I'm also a lot more uncomfortable around unintentionally exposed skin than intentionally exposed skin because it feels like I'm seeing something I'm not supposed to. It's like the difference between watching porn and walking in on your roommate having sex. No matter how much porn you watch, accidentally seeing someone having sex is much more awkward because they didn't mean for you to see it. Maybe these women know their cheeks are completely visible, but it doesn't seem like that's a choice they were trying to make and to me, that makes it much more uncomfortable and distracting. It's like someone you don't know has toilet paper on their shoe or their skirt tucked into their underwear, except worse because you can't tell them and have them fix it immediately if they want to. I guess it's still their choice if they want to wear see through leggings, but I hope they at least know that they're see through.
