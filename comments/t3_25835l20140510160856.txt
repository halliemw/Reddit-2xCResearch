If you get a DivaCup or other reusable catcher, remember that you should be using purified and potable water to rinse it out. It's an absolute pain to pump clean water through a filter into a bottle just to rinse your cup out in the dirt. Not the most sanitary procedure, and if you accidentally drop it in the dirt you should be boiling it to clean it. I found a bit of a steep learning curve with the DivaCup, and I wouldn't recommend it as a something to try on a camping trip for the first time.

I would treat your menstrual waste as poops: dig a cat hole away from your camping location, bury tampons as you would toilet paper. 

Alternatively, if you're a Leave No Trace camper or in a high traffic area where you must practice LNT, (EDIT: they recommend [packing out tampons] (https://lnt.org/learn/principle-3))
If you can pack it out, remember to treat it like a food product in that it should be kept out of your tent at night and hoisted so that bears or other predators cannot get to it.
