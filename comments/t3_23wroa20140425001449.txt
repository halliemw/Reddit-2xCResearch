I would start to ask members of your family if they're straight. Even though your parents have been together for years, i would constantly pester them everytime i saw them, with constant - 'are you sure you're not gay? That top/haircut/thing that you do is kinda gay. You can tell me if you wan't you can trust me, i love you no matter what...'. even if you have to do it sarcastically.  just do that constantly for a while, surely they will see how annoying it is for you!
