The problem is, the dissent isn't rational. Just because there ARE two sides to a coin, it doesn't necessarily follow that both sides are weighted equally. 

There is a Flat Earth Society, for instance, but I don't see too many people who feel that the dissenting side on the "round earth" issue should be given equal consideration.
