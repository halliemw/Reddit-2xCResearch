Several months ago I got fired from a job that I hated and had a bays club bro-y culture. My opinions were rarely respected, my talents were always doubted, not to mention 60 hour weeks were expected and I've got a boatload of autoimmune disorders that mean I need a minimum of 10 hours of sleep a night. 

I'm two months into a new job, I'm doing fantastically, and it seems like people actually think I'm good at what I'm doing. I mean, I'm thinking I'm good at this. I'm recovering from the depression and anxiety that my former job fostered and regaining the confidence that I'm a capable human being.

Also, I've found a new apartment for the fall and its got a piano in it. 


Oh, and my car is paid off!
