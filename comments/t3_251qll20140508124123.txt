I've seen this complaint about TwoX before, and I guess I just don't really understand how you propose that a pro-women community could possibly aim *not* to be about feminism. Like, I understand people not wanting the sub to have explicitly feminist goals, but I don't really understand how you can complain that a sub for women's interests is too steeped in people who are advocates for women's issues.
