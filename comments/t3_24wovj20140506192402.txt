In day-to-day life situations, this kind of "advice" is ridiculous and terrible because the vast majority of sexual assault is carried out by people the victim knows, and the "advice" is used as a weapon to control women's behavior. In traveling, though, I suppose the highest risk encounter would truly be the rapists of horror stories that attack random women. I can't seem to find the actual study to back this up, but I do recall data that suggested quite heavily that, in such situations, dress absolutely does NOT matter to the perpetrator. However, I would assume that study did not take into effect cultural variations, and was most likely US-centric.

So, what I'm trying to say: I agree that these are unqualified statements. They are, as far as I can tell, baseless (no data) and only serve to keep rape myths/rape culture alive. I think the advice to avoid excessive drinking should be presented to ALL travelers in a foreign country regardless of gender, especially if they aren't travelling in a group, as general travel etiquette/safety rather than DON'T GET RAPED. As the information is currently presented, though, I find it very squicky and victim-blaming.
