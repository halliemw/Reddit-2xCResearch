Honestly, I think minimum wage should be based on if a company has X percent of workers on welfare.

go above X percent and the company has to pay more until it goes down.

I doubt many businesses are able to run their stores off of purely pre-married pre-children labor, so I doubt they will get laid off because of it, although that has to be researched first.

So, yeah, totally on topic for this subreddit now?
