I love the older sewing machines. That one is actually my mother-in-law's. She bought a second one a while back because hers needed new motor parts and the second one had something else wrong with it. So by combining them, she was able to have the one working machine. Dedication!

This [is my machine that I currently use at my house](http://i.imgur.com/GRNYM5k.jpg). Singer from 1975. It was my grandmother's.
