Tell them exactly that. Say that you want to come to the party and you appreciate their friendship, but their body policing makes you really uncomfortable and feel objectified. Maybe even tell them you have stretch marks too (for different reasons) if you think it'll make them feel better.

You're right. It sounds like they're projecting their insecurities onto the nearest thing they think they can control. That's not okay, but it's also not your place to force them to take responsbility for it. You only have control over how YOU respond to the situation.

You wear what you want to wear. Etiquette, on the other hand, does dictate that if the owner asks you to conform to a dress code, you ought to. You can, however, opt out of going.
