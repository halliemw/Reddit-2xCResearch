I'll admit I haven't read every single one of her comments, but I could see how it would be frustrating to point out a blatantly sexist situation and to be demonized because people want to split hairs. Don't get me wrong, this is why discussion is important, to get to the root of the problem and to become enlightened.

Not the vendor's fault, but the fault of the person who gives their money in order to express their gender hate.
