My esthetician and I were discussing one day. She said two things.

1) many women ask if they are "normal". There is no normal. Everyone is different.

2) you can keep your dignity or you can have your asshole waxed. Not both. 

It's not a big deal. It hurts but is over quickly. Exfoliate and wear loose clothing the first day.
