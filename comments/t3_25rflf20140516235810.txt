Well I certainly agree that op's bf needs to learn how to communicate in a constructive way, I really think that's the core of the problem here, not the fact that he has an interest in her fashion choices.

I also never ment to imply that she should change her style for him, but wearing something you know your SO likes every now and then is a good way to become closer. For example, my SO bought me a pokemon shirt that I like, but it's kinda girly looking, and I'm not comfortable wearing it most places. But every now and then, I'll break it out and wear it one day, particularly if we're just going to spend the day at home. It's not my style, but I know she likes it, so it doesn't bother me.
