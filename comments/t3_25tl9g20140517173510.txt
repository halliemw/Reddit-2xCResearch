Try out /r/raisedbynarcissists (hope I spelled that right).

I can't say that I've ever had experience with people of this nature, but if you don't want her there then for the love of your baby/god/whoever do NOT invite her. I would think of it in terms of the future; would you want your child around this person.

As for your SO wanting his father there, I totally feel for him. But his father is clearly in the abusive cycle and won't leave the mother...I don't think he should be invited either unless it's explicit that the mother will not be coming. That of course creates a lot of drama, but who knows. Maybe it's the wakeup call the dad needs; get this abusive person out of your life so you can see your grandkids, OR not being able to see your own grandkids? It may sound petty and coercive, but I'm concerned about the effect this would have on the child, which simply should not be exposed to the mother, in or out of the womb! Abusive people can play off people's guilt; but the fact of the matter is that you DO NOT have to keep toxic/abusive people in your life if you don't want them there. DO NOT feel guilty about cutting them out (that's just what they are counting on). If you feel it's the best for your new family, then do it and stick to it. You can do this!
