:'( it was already too late, I had been "tainted". My chance of finding true love slipped between my fingers.  /s

It totally came out of left field with them. I had no idea they were racist until both of them started saying shit like that. Luckily, I'm dating a guy that hates racist shitbags as much as I do :) black ex is engaged to and presumably tainting another white girl haha
