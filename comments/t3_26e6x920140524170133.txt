Do you want to keep X as a friend?

It's probably a difficult question to answer, but it's what you're going to have to answer to move forward. You did nothing wrong, so put your guilt aside and figure out whether or not you can really keep X as a friend after this.

If you don't, then that's easy. Stop talking to him and cut him out of your life. He may want an explanation, but you don't owe him one. If you want to talk to him and tell him how betraying your trust hurt you, that's on you to decide. Letting him know what you're feeling does not mean you have to forgive him.

If you do want to keep him as a friend, you need to make him understand why you're as hurt as you are. Not everyone sees a kiss as a violation of trust or personal space, but if you do, then he should respect that. Talk to him, bring along a neutral friend if you can't be alone with him, and try to be calm. Let him know his actions seriously hurt you, and that he needs to avoid doing that in the future.

tl;dr you are not at fault here, and what happens next is up to you, not him.
