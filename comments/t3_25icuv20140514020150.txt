I'm super, super non-confrontational too. I avoid situations that might be tense like the plague (and yes, I realise this is unhealthy -- I'm working on it!)

But phrasing it in that way isn't accusatory or anything. And it's open-ended enough that you're more likely to get an honest/thorough response, imo. 

Good luck :)
