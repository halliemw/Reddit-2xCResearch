My mom started open conversation with me very young - I can't even recall what age, but I know that it was at least a few years before I started my period.  When I was 12 I started it, and (after panicking for about 4 minutes) I realized I knew exactly what was happening.  Even if I might have been a little young, it was good that I knew what was coming when I got older.  There's no way of knowing when you're daughter will start - even if you're not ready to have the full birds and bees talk with her yet, I think it will be better in the long run the sooner you have that conversation. I can't imagine starting my period without knowing what was happening - I probably would have thought I was dying.
