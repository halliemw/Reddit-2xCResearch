> the idea of abortion being used as birth control is become more acceptable, and that is dangerous from a health care perspective.

This is simply not true. The utter most women who get pregnant and decide to abort do not do it with a shrug. It is inconvenient, time consuming and likely to be emotionally taxing. I seriously doubt using it as a birth control is a thing and I have found no scientific sources for this to be the case.

> I hope most people WOULD agree that prevention is best. I just wish that we could promote this view as often and as effectively as the positive light of abortion is portrayed both in this sub and out.

I think we do? There is a lot of talk about various forms of birth control and frequent worry over how effective they are. What people need is sex education in school. THAT, if anything, would cause a significant drop in abortion...
