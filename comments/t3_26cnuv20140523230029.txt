I'm so sorry this happened to you. I've had personal experience with this and I know a bit about the victim's rights. Depending on which state you live in, it's most likely not too late to report what happened to the police. Here's a link to a website that can help you find the "statute of limitations" in your state.

I do want to advise you to find a counselor before you make the decision whether or not to report the crime. It took me a very long time to choose to report to the police and I had very little evidence to make a case. It was pretty devastating, but my therapist got me through it.

The RAINN website can also help you find a counselor. This organization was there for me when absolutely no one else was, including my parents.

If you ever want to talk, I'm here.
