Looked into it and called ICE. They said chances are an anonymous tip won't get investigated unless they have a ton of information (full name, birthday, home+work addresses, license plate info). It'd be a much faster process however if he was arrested and found guilty of a crime.

I suppose it'll come as a comfort to my friend knowing that a police report really *won't* do anything but leave a paper trail.
