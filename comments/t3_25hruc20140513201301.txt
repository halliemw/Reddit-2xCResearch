I'm a 27 year old guy and I've pursued two women in their mid-thirties and dated one of them.  Single women are harder and harder to find as you get older.  If you don't have kids, and you're in shape like you claim, you are a rare and valuable breed.

The fact that you're 6'3" almost definitely has a lot to do with your lack of romantic success, but only because it sounds like you have few other potentially undesirable traits that would be easy for a guy to pick up on without getting to know you well first.  I'd certainly date a woman who was 6'3" if she seemed interested in me (I'm a very average 5'10.5").

I am a little puzzled at your general outlook on all this.  A loving relationship is "the one thing [you] desperately wanted", but you consciously decided to take a passive approach?  I find the term "husband hunting" really weird, but if you care so much about a relationship, yeah you should probably be trying harder to meet new people.  I suspect if you really analyzed the situation carefully you'd find that the couples you know didn't all just fall into each others' lap.  Maybe they met through mutual friends and didn't have to join a yoga class or something in an attempt to meet new people, but they still had to put some real effort into establishing and maintaining a connection.  We all have a long list of friends-of-friends we haven't bothered to do that with, and that's the default position.  Romance takes some effort and some courage even in optimal conditions.
