That's not true. I'm a guy and I find 2XC fascinating - it's a great resource to find out how the other half lives. It's also one of the most fair, civilized subreddits out there.

But man, I've got to say the mods made a terrible decision in making this a default. Now that it's default, it will attract guys who are on an anti-feminism (read: male oppression) campaign. Don't you read comments in other frontpaged subreddits? Often times I speak up against gross and rampant sexism, only to receive a denial in response or be accused of being a "white knight" for having a basic sense of awareness and compassion. If you engage with them, they just project their lowness onto you. 

Good luck guys! I hope this doesn't kill the subreddit.
