If anyone stares at your breasts long enough to notice they're different, they should probably get smacked. Because that's just rude. And if they tell you you did something bad to your body? Smack them again. With a frying pan. 

It's your body. If this temporary pain will eliminate a long term pain and give you more happiness in yourself, then go for it.
