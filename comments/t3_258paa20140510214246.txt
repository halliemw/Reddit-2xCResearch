When my boyfriend gives me a rundown of what makes me pretty or beautiful, "tits and ass" are usually not the top of the list. It's "I love your sexy eyes," "I love your little nose," "I love your freaky tiny pinky toe." And when I think about what I love about him, yeah, he has a cute butt but I love his big hands, his dimples, and his fluffy hair. The people who like you or love you like YOU and love YOU, they aren't looking for you to conform to something else. They are looking for YOU.
