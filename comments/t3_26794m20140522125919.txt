Right, but the OP is not talking about a "she was mean to me, waaaahhhh!" frivolous personality conflict.  She is talking about an employee who either does not show up to work, or when she does bother to show up, she does not pull her weight.  It's not about personal drama.  The supervisor felt it necessary to hire an additional person to pick up the slack for Sister2, so the supervisor already intervened in a roundabout (and passive and avoidant) manner.

There's nothing left for the OP to do but stagnate in a work environment that apparently rewards people for knowing how to work and manipulate the office culture in place.  Pregnancy is not an excuse to surf the web all day and to take so many unscheduled days off from work that your supervisor has to hire a temp to cover for you.  Sister1/2 is absolutely entitled to maternity leave...but she's not on maternity leave yet.  If she's well enough to go jaunting off to Sephora during lunch, she's well enough to work while she's at work.  I don't think it's the OP's responsibility to fix any of this.
