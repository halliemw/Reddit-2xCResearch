I'm not angry, dude. I'm plain tired of hearing the same bullshit all the time, that's all. Besides, you haven't provided studies or stats, nada, you're just doing the "I'm a dude and this is a fact, sorry that your feeble female brain is offended" thing. That's the first time somebody decided to demonstrate me such an amazing conversational prowess. Not.
