I can definitely understand having an aversion to it after that experience. I'd flip my drunk shit if someone tried to record me without my permission, but then I'm naturally an angry drunk anyway. :p

I am sorry that happened to you, honestly. I've definitely had my share of horror stories with people seriously overstepping their bounds when alcohol was involved.

It seems like you do feel bad with the whole boyfriend thing though. I don't blame you. If my partner had a look of disgust on his face at any point while I was trying to please him like that, I'd feel the same way.
