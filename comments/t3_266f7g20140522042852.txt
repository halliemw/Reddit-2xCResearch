There are many types of heating pads, but I like the natural kind that's made from cotton fabric and filled with rice or feed corn. They're easily heated in a couple of minutes in the microwave, and it's safe to fall asleep with one (unlike some of the electric kinds).

They're [available on Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/search/handmade?q=rice%20heating%20pad&order=most_relevant&ship_to=US&ref=auto2&explicit_scope=1) in various shapes and sizes, or if you do any sewing you can make your own in any size you like--just make sure to use 100% cotton fabric, as some other types of fabric are not safe in the microwave. I made one for myself and have got a ton of use out of it both for cramps and for my eternally freezing feet.
