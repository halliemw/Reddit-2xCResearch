Kristen Bell is quite short and her character  Veronica Mars is a freaking bad ass!!

Don't let what anyone says or does hold you back.

I've two friends who are really short. They call themselves "fun size" which always makes me chuckle. (It's usually in bars when guys are like "wow! You're so short, lol" and they have such sweet serene faces as they say "actually, I'm just fun-size")

I've always envied these girls because there's a TK Maxx (TJ Maxx) near us and they always find the best shoes in the smaller sizes. 

Also, at 5'6 with a baby face I get asked for I.D everywhere I go! It's so frustrating!!
