I would say towards the end you are correct - he directed his hate towards women specifically.

Early on in his life the specific people he hated were almost entirely men. The occasional woman was mentioned if she bullied him, but he felt jealous of and hated mostly guys that were popular with women. So certainly women were a focus of his life, but he didn't hate them per say at the onset. He was mostly just nervous of women, likely because it would destroy his sense of overinflated self-worth if he got rejected. Narcissism to the extreme.

However later on in life, maybe due to PUAhate or whatever his other influences, he directed most of his hate towards women and concluded that they were the ones that were flawed and not him.
