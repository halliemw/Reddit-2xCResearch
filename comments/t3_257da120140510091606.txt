Im 2 years older than my BF (im 26, he's 24), and I was really self conscious of it at the beginning, mainly due to a friend comparing him to her older boyfriend and saying shit like "oh, I don't know how you can go out with someone younger than you". I was synthesising all her crap, but then I realised, fuck, I am finally really happy and have met someone incredible. I'm not throwing something good away because of a stupid number.


BF and I are still together and going really strong. He's actually more mature than me anyway.
