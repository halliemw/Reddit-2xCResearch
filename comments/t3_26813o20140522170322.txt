South Park did a three part GOT episode where one of the characters (Butters) who had never seen the show or read the books started to watch it.  He noticed that whenever they show weiners on the show, it's always gay weiner "because it's less threatening to female viewers," or they show straight guys with floppy weiners.  I know South Park is hit or miss and I'm not trying to get into a big debate about it, but I thought they made some clever observations in that episode.
