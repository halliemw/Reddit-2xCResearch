Jesus H Christ. OK-- I can totally understand why you are getting frustrated with her. If I were me, I would've lost my shit a long time ago. This relationship is clearly not in her best interest, whether she sees that today or 10 years from now (or never), that's just the way it is. I think you are totally doing the right thing by sticking with her, but something I think you should take into account is that you are not her. If he makes you uncomfortable, you should be honest with her about that (and if it comes to it, be honest with him too). You are not the one who chooses to stay in a toxic relationship. You are doing the right thing by being there for her, but that doesn't mean you should have to deal with his bullshit.
