Hell yeah! :) You should do whatever you're comfortable with!

I actually didn't even realize about the separation of hairy/not hairy until I got my back waxed and then looked at my shoulders/arms and realized that I was still clearly hairy there. To me, that was more embarrassing than being totally hairy.
