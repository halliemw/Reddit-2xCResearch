A lot of people are mentioning pregnancy tests. Just FYI, you can order test strip style ones from Amazon (and probably other places) in bulk for obscenely cheap. They need to be dipped, so get some Dixie cups or something too. I have an IUD and haven't had a real period in years, so I try to take pregnancy tests pretty frequently. I also let my friends know that they can always help themselves.
