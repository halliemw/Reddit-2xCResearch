Nude beaching is the best thing ever! And you're basically surrounded (not literally as nude beaches aren't typically packed at all, at least in the US) by people who give *zero* fucks about it. Yeah, the creepers kinda suck but they don't typically pop up very often where I'm at.

There's really nothing quite like walking along the beach feeling the wind and sun on all your parts. :)
