Body count is irrelevent in the face of what his plans were.

His plans were always to initially kill his two (male) roomates so he could have the apartment to himself to lure others (no gender specified at the time) under illusion to come to the apartment so he could kill them.

He also had the idea to kill his stepbrother to stop him succeeding him, and to kill his step mother too.

This was his plan to precede the DAY OF REVENGE.  The day of revenge was his ultimate goal, to kill women, particularly sorority girls, to PUNISH them.  He makes it very clear in his video what his plan was and why he was doing it... he mentions over and over again that he is going to slaughter women to punish them.

Ultimately, and thankfully, his plan failed.  Unfortunately he was still able to murder several people and wound many more.
But his plan unraveled, he didn't get the time to do what he wanted and he broke from his plans when things got difficult or didn't go according to his expectation (couldnt easily get inside the sorority house) and the police were able to respond quicker than he probably factored.  And he had to call an end to everything much quicker (His initial plan was to suicide with lethal concoction of Rx drugs + gun)
