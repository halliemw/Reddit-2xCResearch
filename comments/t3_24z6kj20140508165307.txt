I see where you're coming from, I really do.  You and I both see serious injustice in the world for men, one might even go so far as to call it *female privilege* if you like.  Sure, much of it was created by the patriarchy -- a cultural phenomenon dominated and mostly directed by men -- but it's definitely privilege.

What I don't understand, is how you appear to be intentionally ignoring evidence of male privilege in our society, and how it eclipses any benefits being a woman might have.  You simply can't point at **thousands of years** of male dominated culture and say something like "but women get to decide to have babies now" like that's somehow supposed to balance it all out.

There are courts in your country seriously considering the appropriateness of forcing medical procedures on women against their will.  In 2014, a "first-world" nation is doing stuff we typically associate with dictatorships and failed states... but it's ok because it's just being done to women.

Don't kid yourself, the sides are not balanced here.

## "Reproductive Choice"

You really have to let go of this term.  It's horrible and it offers you nothing.  Abortion rights have nothing to do with reproduction, or a man's "choice" in the matter.  *It's about bodily autonomy*.  The state can't force you to donate a kidney, no matter how much someone else might need it.  *It's your body, your choice*.

## "...ridiculous, even for an MRA"

MRAs have a well-earned reputation for ridiculous arguments like suggesting that all women vote as a block.  It doesn't do them any favours.

## But men are(/were) oppressed too!  So we're equal!

No.  If at this point you don't get it, I'm not sure that it's in my power to make it happen, but I give it one last try:

You simply can't draw comparisons between experienced pains and claim equality.  Of course nearly everyone was oppressed throughout much of human history.  Of course the churches have oppressed people all over the world since the gods were invented.  **This does not mean that women weren't singled out for special treatment**.

This peninsula in Greece isn't a women's bathroom.  Comparing the two shows just how much you don't understand about institutional oppression.  *Women banned from ever setting foot there because they're unclean creatures who will tempt otherwise holy men to deviate from their path toward "God"*.

Religion is one of the most powerful opiates culture has and it has, nearly without exception, been hell-bent on the subjugation of women from the very start.  In nearly every story in the bible, if a woman exists at all, she is typically a fool or a temptress.... or she's simply a vessel for another man.

There is no parity here.  You can't compare injuries and expect to come up equals.  Throughout history and in the present, religious and state institutions have worked to maintain the role of women as secondary to men.

I'm getting pretty tired at this point, but I'll try to answer your questions briefly:

## Job Security

Women are discriminated against at hiring time, based on the assumption that they will be the one responsible for children and will therefore abandon the company.  In some countries this includes the penalty of maternity leave, often there is no male equivalent.

## Political Power

You can't say that women have more power because they bother to show up to vote.  Women's issues are as diverse as those of men, save for political moves to recognise a woman's status as that of one equal to a man's (like bodily autonomy).

You can however point out that they're regularly under-represented in public office, and when they do dare to move into the spotlight, they have to deal with the handicap of being asked questions at every turn like "What about your family?" while simultaneously being mocked as a nag, crone, or slut -- depending on their age demographic.

Men manage to enjoy running for political office rarely if ever being asked any such questions.  The default assumption is that someone is taking care of their family (read: someone-not-male), that age == wisdom, and youth == fresh ideas.

## Cultural Influence

My favourite example of male privilege in culture is [this video](http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/cross-post-quote-of-the-day-scarlett-johansson-tired-of-sexist-diet-questions) where a reporter questions Robert Downey Jr regarding character development in his Iron Man movies, and then in the very next breath asks Scarlett Johansson about dieting tips.

Culturally we see men as our heroes, our leaders, and our villains.  Women are window dressing.  Their job is to be attractive, develop the male characters, and give birth to more male heroes, leaders, and villains.

It's not just movies, it's television, books, even plays from the 1600s.  Few are the stories that feature central female roles, fewer still are the stories of women who perform in roles we have come to expect from men (heroes, leaders, villains).

Another fun one is [The Bechdel Test](http://bechdeltest.com/).  It's simple: think of a movie.  Now test to see if there are two named female characters in it.  Now test to see if they actually speak to each other.  Finally, test to see if that conversation is about anything other than a man.

The failure rate for the Bechdel Test is astoundingly terrible, but the the fact that most movies pass the test with the genders reversed should tell you just how much value we place on the stories of women in our culture.

## Rape Culture

I'm pretty sure that you don't know what this is, so I'll direct you over to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) for the break down.  Needless to say, it's not a comparison of who gets raped more, but rather it's a statement about how rape is used culturally as a weapon to illicit fear and obedience from women.

## Class Struggle

I see what you're saying here, and it's easy to fall into this trap.  There is a very real class struggle happening in the world right now, but this does not negate the also-very-real struggle we are still fighting to see women accepted as equal people in the eyes of society and the law.

## Side Anecodote

I have a dear friend who just accepted a job to work for a very prominent and public IT company.  As her profile will now come into the public eye, (her Twitter feed, personal blog, GitHub repo for example), she's now faced with a rather humbling decision: should she keep per real name on her public profile?  Is she willing to endure the *endless, viscous, sexist, and violent harassment* that comes with being a woman in IT, working with a public profile?

When she asked me for advice I didn't know what to say.  I was honestly surprised.  *It had never occurred to me* that that would even be a thing -- and I'm actually familiar with the industry and the rampant sexism within it.  This is the very nature of privilege: *we often don't know we have it*.

## Who should read what

I see that you're stuck on this, and again I can see where you're coming from.  No one likes to be lumped in with a generalisation and told to do something, but when it comes to something like privilege -- which we've established is something we all too often don't recognise because we're too close -- I think it's perfectly reasonable to make such a suggestion.  In fact, given all of your responses to in this thread, it's clear that you still don't recognise your own privilege.  I can only hope this whole exercise has furthered you down the path to the day when you finally do see it.
