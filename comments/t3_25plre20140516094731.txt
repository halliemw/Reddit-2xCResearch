I wasn't necessarily talking about the statistics trend on the thread. I was talking about even more basic comments. I really did reply to a person saying "Wtf can you explain how it was rape if it started off consenual and you didn't fight it?? I mean at what point mid sex could it become rape? I am genuinely curious and this thread just makes me feel like a rape all my girlfriends but they don't say anything :("

The whole statistics/anecdote stuff I understand annoyed some people, but I really meant the very bottom of the barrel questions like the one I listed.  While the thread wasn't *full* of them, they were present, and it was responding to this particularly stupid question that made me realize the trend of how I've been feeling in the comment section over the last few days.
