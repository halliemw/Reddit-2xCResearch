My mom did this to me in high school, although she wasn't as pushy about it. Fast forward five years–I have a boyfriend, as does my brother. I just think of those years as practice for them. :)

What ended up working for me was not engaging in those conversations–I don't think they were convinced until I started dating, but they understood that being aggressively accepting wasn't productive. You could also try having a very direct conversation about the action and let the underlying belief work itself out ("I know that you accept me regardless of sexuality, and that's very touching. However, these conversations are very upsetting–please treat me normally.")
