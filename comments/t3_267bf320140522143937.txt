I think most modern feminists believe that reproductive freedom is a basic human right and yet in some states, that right is being eroded by frivolous legislation designed to make it very difficult or impossible for a woman to exercise that right. More laws limiting a woman's access to abortion have been passed within the last 3-4 years than at any other time since Roe v Wade. So it isn't radical to call yourself a feminist in a western country because while feminism has come a long way, there are still very real and legitimate concerns.
