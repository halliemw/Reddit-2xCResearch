I wont comment on the pregnancy or your relationship, That's a very personal issue you must approach yourself. (My mother aborted what would of been her third child, she had my father's support, It was the right move for her but she felt that my father 'forced' her into it and regretted it on an emotional level. I don't think there is anything wrong with keeping this a secret from your husband if you know what is right for you, that is what you must do. But secrets and dishonesty can become toxic so you need to think carefully about what you will tell him)

What I actually want to say, is that following this pregnancy, however it turns out, You should look into more discrete methods of birth control such as Depo Povera or Implanon. Depo Povera has no evidence, its just one injection in your arm or thigh or stomach every 12 weeks, it should be much easier to organise a 12 week injection than a once-a-month script. Also there wont be any pills lying around your house for your husband to find.

Implanon is even better because it lasts 3 years, But it is a rod that goes in your arm so if your husband touches the under-side of your armpit for any reason he may feel it. It can also be bruised for a few days after insertion. But again, No trying to organise scripts and no pills lying around. 

If you are sure you are finished having children, you could look into more permanent sterilisation, If you are comfortable living with the lie, you could tell your husband that fowling your third pregnancy/ recent "Miscarriage" you developed some scar tissue and for medical reasons had to have this procedure, it was not a contraceptive choice. That might make him feel it is less of a sin.
