I find it frustrating that so many feminists can't even try to understand why some people might not want to identify as a feminist.

When you identify as a feminist, you are not just identifying with an ideology that is rooted in equality.  You're identifying with a lot of connotations, and a lot of them are not good and a lot of them are not undeserved either.
