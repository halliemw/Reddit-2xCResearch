This is really sad. This whole situation is really sad. This sub used to be a safe place. Often, when I was feeling anxious and stressed, I would open up /r/twoxchromosomes and it would calm me down. I knew that people would be supportive and that sexist comments would not be allowed. I knew that if I posted a comment, I wouldn't have to worry about the rest of the mouth-breathing creepers on Reddit. It was a place where you could let down your guard a bit. 

I get that they want to educate the rest of reddit. But after a stressful day dealing with it in the real world, I want a place where I don't have to educate everyone else about womens issues. 

Seriously, mods. This is not something you should have done without asking the rest of the sub. This is not something that will blow over and all be fine. It's getting more argumentative and less supportive every minute.

It's just really sad.
