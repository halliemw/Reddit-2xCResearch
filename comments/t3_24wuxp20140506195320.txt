I had many thoughts about Lewinsky when news of this affair with Clinton first came out in 1996.  Book looks interesting, and from the article I actually feel sorry for her.  Maybe I'll just read it for her comments on Hillary Clinton.  From the article cited:  


>Lewinsky is also clear-eyed about Hillary Clinton, noting that if “narcissistic loony toon” was “the worst thing she said, I should be so lucky.” She adds, “Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband’s affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him,” and goes on, “Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband’s mistress. She may have faulted her husband for being inappropriate, but I find her impulse to blame the Woman — not only me, but herself – troubling.”


>Lewinsky’s summary of the affair that upended not only her own life but that of the nation is succinct. “I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton,” she writes. “Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened.”

Well written article, and I think I'll borrow the book from the library.  What do you think?  Do you remember when this woman was on the news every day for quite some time?
