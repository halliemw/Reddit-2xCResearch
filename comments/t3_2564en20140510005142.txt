> Are they okay to wear overnight

Yup!  One warning though.. occasionally if you have a super heavy flow night and laze about in bed for a while, be prepared for the ride tides of doom when you finally stand up.  It's only happened to me once but it was BAD

> tilted cervix

I can't say for sure, but I suspect this may actually cause issues. My cervix likes to chill really far down so I have to jam the cup on there, like a hat in order to make sure it's both a) under my cervix and b) not hanging out right in my vaginal opening and being super irritating.

Apparently 'normal' people get to just insert the thing and let it sit wherever it happens to be.. the cup will always be low enough to catch all the pan drippings (the gross 2x threads from the last few days have been amazing!!)

So long story short (too late!) if your cervix is naturally higher up you might be ok?  But it might just be one of those things you'll have to give a whirl and see how it works out

For what it's worth I'm never going back to pads & tampons. The cup can be a pain in the ass sometimes but it's way less gross/uncomfortable/wasteful/etc than the alternatives
