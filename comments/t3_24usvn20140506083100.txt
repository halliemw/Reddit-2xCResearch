Two years is a long time to have not met someone, even in passing, that is your boyfriend best friend (provided you all live in the same city). It seems very odd to me-though it'd be odd if the friend was male as well.

I don't think it falls on you or the friend, but rather your boyfriend. He is meant to integrate you in to his world and vice versa. Does he know your friends? If yes, it's probably not because he called them and said "you're my gf's friend! Let's hang out". I'm sure you introduced them. I mean, when you meet you both should be friendly but it's neither of your responsibilities to "make the first move".

Though if you have met all of his friends besides this girl, that would seriously set off alarms for me.
