I dont view all women as bitches, I'm using my own experiences where I'v been very close with girls in the past however there has always been drama and bitchiness with them starting rumours etc.. I was already friends with a few guys through my brother so I just started hanging out with them more. I have been friends with a number of girls before and got on really quite well.
