Yeah; that's a red light there. He isn't respecting you or your body. Don't put up with a manipulator. I was with one for a long time and I still get angry about that stuff, even though I found someone completely different and married him up :)  That's abusive and it isn't something anyone should have to put up with. It's not okay.
