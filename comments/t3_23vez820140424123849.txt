I think if you actually sank to their level you'd hate it. Normal people don't send hateful messages to strangers on the internet or try to provoke real-life harassment by doxxing. You have to be deranged to do that stuff to anyone. The best way to combat it is to work towards positive goals, don't lower yourself to the level of some basement-dwelling impotent sexist little troll. They are, in all ways, completely beneath the level of civilized people (who make up the majority of society, they're just the quiet majority).
