Yup. I watched this Natalie Portman movie called The Other Woman one night at about midnight while home alone breastfeeding my first kid. Worst decision ever- all about the aftermath of divorce and an infant that dies of SIDS.

It's weird, I used to be the queen of horror movies and since having kids I have zero stomach for anything. Even the weather network makes me weepy.
