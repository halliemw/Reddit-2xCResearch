If you're regular, then you know by date when you're late or what they're supposed to be like. When you're irregular, when you have something like a potential pregnancy it's important to know when your last period was so that you can estimate how far you may be. Also, when you talk to your doctor, they will want to know just how irregular you are to see if there's something else wrong like polycycstic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is really common but can be treated. Also, FYI, a hormonal birth control pill can totally make you more regular and predictable!
