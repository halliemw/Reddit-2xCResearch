When I read this post I was reminded of [this recent comic](http://www.robot-hugs.com/20140501-190032/) from the webcomic Robot Hugs.

But in all seriousness, maybe he would get it a bit more if you explained it in the context of [intersectionality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality)? You can acknowledge that you might be privileged in certain areas, but oppressed in others--and just because you may be better off than a lot of people in many areas, that doesn't completely negate the oppression you do experience as a woman.
