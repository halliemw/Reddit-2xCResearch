Yeah, he's completely wrong about blood flow.  High intensity exercise is the WORST thing for a concussion.  The fact that he's puking after working out is a very bad sign.  He's going to cause himself permanent brain damage or even worse if he's not careful.

He shouldn't even be working, honestly.  It sounds like a bad concussion and he should really be staying in bed until a doctor signs off on returning to a normal routine.
