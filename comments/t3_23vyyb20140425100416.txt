They've already punished him for his on campus behavior as they saw fit. People are now asking that he be expelled for being a rapist, which is a crime. To me it seems that at this point people are asking that he be punished for being a rapist/criminal, which according to the people we let decide that he is not, and according to the law that hasn't even been called into question. I do think that it could become problematic if the school just folds under public pressure and expels him, it would set an unfortunate precedent. I'm not saying that what's currently happening is a better or ideal situation. I'm just saying that I see why it's a difficult situation, and it's all stemming from the fact that the university was involved in the first place.

>So if you are arguing that school's internal due process measures are inherently insufficient and all discipline must be sent to a court of law, then at least you are being consistent.

Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. If we're going to let universities handle these kinds of things(which I don't think we should), this is what happens. If you're saying that their processes are sufficient due process, then what is the issue? Their process has been completed, they've made a decision and punished the accused as they saw fit and then notified the victim of that punishment. That's what we're accepting if we accept that they can be trusted to handle these cases.

I don't think we should trust a university to try rape cases in any way at all. That's way too serious and we've seen them fuck up similar cases too many times at this point.
