Since there were 2 listed, I'm going to guess that they weren't administered in low doses, because otherwise the dose would have just been raised instead of a second opiate administered. Granted we don't know, but unless they were just listing opiates to be misleading, that's what the evidence suggests.

And it depends on the person as well. A regular dose of an opiate, I think Demerol but I can't remember for sure, made me unable to distinguish between dreams and reality. Not to mention that being terribly sick and in pain can also affect cognitive abilities, so there's a pretty good chance that she was unable to consent.
