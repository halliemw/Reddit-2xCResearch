I don't know why your suggestion was downvoted. Honestly I think EVERY couple could benefit from visiting a counselor for a "check up". Too many people consider it a last ditch effort, but usually by the time they visit, the relationship is dead in the water. Counseling gives the individuals the TOOLS to use to fix their own problems (big or small). Why would you say no when someone offers you ways to better and strengthen your relationship? 

I agree OP and her boyfriend should figure out the "why" instead of just "don't do it again". Other than that, I think she's handling it fairly well and wish them both luck.
