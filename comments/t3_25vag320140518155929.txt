That sounds like a possible hormonal disorder or mental disorder had by a person who happens to be female. 

Has it occurred to you that her issues might be medical in nature, rather than because she is a certain gender?

I have an ex who has depression and addiction issues and he treated me badly because of them. I don't think "all men are assholes" because of my experience with one person with medical issues who happened to be male. Maybe because I've also had experiences with female friends who have depression and addiction issues and treated me badly because of them.

Have you ever had a buddy who flew into a rage and punched a hole through a wall or something? Or got into a fight at a bar over nothing? An inability to control one's anger is an inability to control one's emotions the same way crying over a laptop is.
