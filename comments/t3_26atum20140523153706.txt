A few people in here are being awfully huffy about this supposed "little" thing you did, and how it's no big deal but I'm glad you did. I live in NYC and I know first hand how pushy these guys can be and I'm on the quiet side so if a girl like you helped me out after a guy didn't take the "I'm ignoring you, please move on" hint, I'd be really grateful! :)

In short, you're great!
