This seems to be a reaction piece written by someone who wasn't there. Sorry if I'm missing something, but how does it connect to my comment?

Anyway this line

> Come on Clare, really? There were hundreds of girls at prom. Do you really think that all the chaperone dads were just staring at you?  

gives me a really uncomfortable vibe. Is she saying the girl shouldn't feel uncomfortable, because the dads were probably staring at all the girls? It's pretty unfair to expect a seventeen-year-old *not* to feel uncomfortable when adult men stare at her. They've been taught their whole lives, up to that point, that if a strange man is staring at you, you tell a trusted adult because of stranger danger, etc. They're just not used to adult men looking at them in "that" way yet, so they get scared. It feels wrong to mock them for it.
