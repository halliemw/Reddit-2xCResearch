ugh sorry to hear, but wellbutrin is used first line sometimes so I was just curious, it's not weird or anything. Usually we use it for people who are having low energy/ no motivation and of course almost everybody that wants to quit smoking. Maybe their reasoning was you'd burn out your energy during the day and sleep better but meh, i'm still a medical student. If you hate your psych and it's just for anxiety/depression maybe you could just have your PCP take care of it?
