I picked a pill because it was a very low-hormone option. Unfortunately, the one that I initially started on was too low, and it made me spot bleed constantly for two months. I switched over to another (still low) option and its been working great for me. I don't mind taking it daily, its a very small thing to remember (especially if you set an alarm).
