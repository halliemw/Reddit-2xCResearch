A. You know exactly what I meant by the first part of the comment. Given the nature of this stupid discussion, that is true irony.

B. I don't use twitter. I don't use Facebook. Clearly you have some issues. Why not lay it out for the masses then and allow the depth of your intelligence to bestow upon us, the uninformed, a glimpse of our own stupidity. Because guess what, "come and get it" as far as I am concerned, has nothing to do with abortion, and I don't really care enough to go searching to find out what the connection is. How about choosing a hashtag that makes more sense and is more easily identifiable with your cause? Or just explain what it is. But no, you really enjoy belittling people. Funny thing is, so do I. But at least I know when to belittle someone, and when to help them understand  something.

These are hashtags that are, shall we say, a bit more clear. Can you fathom the unimportance of digging through twitter to find out the answer to something that is so utterly insignificant?

Upset I don't have the whole issue laid out in bite sized chunks? The hash tag on the face of it makes no sense. If it is so deep, complex and important, a link would suffice. Now fuck off.
