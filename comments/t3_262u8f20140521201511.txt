everyone has their faults. i agree with dadofseven that your previous relationship had things that are lacking in your current relationship. but understand that every relationship is unique, and the more of them you have the more regrets you will have in the future. 

i don't agree that you should break up with boy B. when boy C comes along there will be things you missed about boy A and boy B, and you will be further conflicted. 

i think the most important thing to recognize is that there is endless room in your heart for love. just because you still love boy A does not mean that you do not also love boy B. it just means that your eyes are opened to things that boy A brought to the relationship, and because you have experience with these things you are able to miss them (you never miss what you have never experienced, and you don't regret the loss of something you have never had). 

i would suggest that you go to r/redpillwomen and learn how to be a better woman. this will give you the ability to push your guy into being more motivated and more outgoing OR it will increase your own options and allow you to find a better boy C (or even potentially get boy A back if that is what you want).
