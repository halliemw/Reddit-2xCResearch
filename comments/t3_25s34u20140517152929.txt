Haha I dont think he'll go off on him. He's seen him down the street hanging out multiple times this year and hasn't done anything, but that might change if he sees him everyday. He wants to move on though. 

I replied about the "friends" earlier, but here is what I wrote:
I have told one friend who I was closer to, who I don't think believes me. The group was all friends before I joined in, and pretty much all guys & their girlfriends. I didn't tell anyone else because I'm extremely private and I wasn't that close to anyone else. Once the friend I told wasn't supportive, I just decided to drop it and not be friends with any of them anymore.
