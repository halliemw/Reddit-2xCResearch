Like I said, I grabbed them of the first page of Google. I'll take you at your word when you refute these quotes. But let's talk about this. You mentioned a few are from fiction. Why does that matter? Isn't the feminist argument that the pervasiveness of rape in fiction (movies and tv) perpetuates 'rape culture'? Why then does its counterpart in feminist fiction not promote hatred towards men?

You say David Angier isn't a feminist activist. So? Are you saying he's not a feminist at all? Are you saying that as an ADA he has no power regarding the issue he discusses? If his feminist view in this regard guides him as a prosecutor how is that not dangerous?

Are you saying Sharon Stone is not a feminist? Because, if you don't deny she's a feminist, then her celebrity makes her words have value.  If you're saying she isn't a feminist, then why? I haven't been able to find a refutation of this quote.

Regarding Andrea Dworkin's interview, your refutation doesn't make the point you want. It is possible to be prejudice against a group based on sex, but still respect some of them.

And since when does consent have to be enthusiastic? On a daily basis I consent to many things unenthusiastically. Am I being raped each time?
