I can't give advice that hasn't already been given in this thread, but I went through a similar situation with a history professor. At one point during his lecture, he was talking about how religion has influenced history and out came the words "you see, the atheist is retarded..." He spouted off a lot of conspiracy theories, one about how people from China are coming here to steal our water. And he had an extra credit assignment where you had to put up political signs in support of a specific candidate he wasn't naming, and when asked about the name of the candidate he'd say "why does that matter?"

I filed a complaint, naming the clearly biased assignment and the statement he'd made. Got asked to come in for a talk from the department head, thought she'd be asking me questions about the assignment which was my main complaint, instead was the subject of an hour long interview about what life is like as an atheist and a teaching of the "duck walk", aka letting silly little comments like that wash off my back. :\

Yes, there will be quite a few professors in your life as a college student who will say things that are pretty crappy and unprofessional. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't be held accountable, like with any profession. Teaching is a vital job, and a positing of great influence to the next generation. With this influence comes responsibility.
