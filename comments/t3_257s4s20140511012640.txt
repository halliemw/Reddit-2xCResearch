His frame of mind and motivation - that he may have "crushing insecurity," or a mental illness - do not in any way change the fact that he violated her. You giving her these hypotheticals does not lessen the trauma she experienced, or change the fact that she was assaulted (and she **was** assaulted).

I agree that, if this were to go to court, it's likely that he would not be convicted because she gave (albeit very reluctant) verbal consent, and it would be difficult to prove that that consent was coerced or withdrawn (which, in both cases, would legally mean that what he did was assault). The bar that must be cleared in order to convict someone for assault is very high (and rightly so), so just because someone can't be convicted under the letter of the law doesn't necessarily mean they didn't commit the act they are accused of. 

If this were to go to court, the burden of proof would reside with OP (she would have to present evidence that proved beyond a reasonable doubt that her ex raped her). Here, in this discussion, she doesn't have to do that. We are giving her the benefit of assumption - that what she said happened is actually what happened.

So, if we take what OP says happened as true, here's what the law says: Consent was not given because OP's verbal consent was coerced (so it doesn't legally count). But let's play devil's advocate; let's say the verbals consent was valid (ie not coerced). Even if this were the case, she was still assaulted, as crying and other negative body language (cringing, pulling away, etc) legally (and, quite frankly, under the application of simple common sense) qualifies as non-verbal withdrawal of consent.

Tl;dr: If someone's crying and clearly having a bad time, don't have sex with them.
