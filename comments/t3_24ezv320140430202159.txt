So I'm also 19 in a LTR, and I have the Mirena! I am very happy with it because hbc pills were making me cry ALL THE TIME and also break out like no other, BUT having had it for about 5 months now, I did end up in the ER with an ovarian cyst (not because the cyst was so bad, but because my school's clinic thought I had appendicitis based on the pain I had). Aside from that, I would NOT get it inserted right before finals, because (at least in my experience, which I don't think is typical) I was cramping so badly I didn't do anything for at least a week and a half. Like I watched a full two seasons of Scandal on the couch with a heating pad and a cuddly boyfriend. They gave me a tiny tiny amount of xanax but no pain meds, and told me to take motrin. But overall, I still like it! (Shockingly, haha). PM me if you have more questions!
