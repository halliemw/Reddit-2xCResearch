Love it! I also love that you mentioned the blue jay - our own fearless leader, Sam, once chased a blue jay incessantly until it had finally had enough, turned around, and bit Sam on the ear! He has a split at the top of his ear that became his trademark for the rest of his life as no set of stitches could ever seem to repair it. I really think Abyssinians are the only cats with enough guts to go after vicious blue jays like that! Amazing.

Good luck to you and your household as you attempt to navigate your way without your leader... in time you may need to consider electing a new leader before complete anarchy takes over! :)
