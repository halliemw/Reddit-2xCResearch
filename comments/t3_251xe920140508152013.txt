I think you should look up how pregnancy affects your mind. It sounds crazy, but I have seen pregnant women become pretty nuts about random things. Its not your fault its the hormones and your body making a new life. Hopefully he can understand the next 8-9 months might be a little hectic because of that and it might help him realize he is not adjusting correctly to you. Especially if money is tight and it is unplanned. He might be under a lot of stress as well and that would be affecting his mind. You are not overreacting by going to a counselor, but he might think that you are doing it because he thinks you think he cant help you either. 

A counselor can only help you so much. Good luck.
