I just can't understand and that's that. I also don't understand homophobia, string theory, illiteracy and big bunch of other things. 

 And of course people wear what they want, I am not running over to them to thump them on the head with my beliefs.  

As for the "it's comfortable" argument not being one, let me rephrase that to: it is not an argument for me. I find going out and about in exercise clothing distasteful, but that is my personal opinion and other that ranting about it in the semi-anonymus interweb, I don't actually go around forcing it on others.
