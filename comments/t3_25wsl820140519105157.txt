This sounds like spotting to me. It does happen to women on hormal bc and is probably nothing to worry about at all. A lot of women do experience breakthrough bleeding and spotting when on bc. It is completley normal. However, I would still go to the doctors and explain the situation.

Unexplained bleeding and spotting can sometimes be a sign of more serious things, like an infection. Dont worry too much - the testing procedure is painless and these things are easiky remedied. The doctor will use a speculum to have a look at what's going on down there and take a few swabs for testing. You'll usually get the results in a few days and, if there is anything amiss, they'll treat you (usually a short course of antibitoic or anti-fungals). 

Going to the doctor should put your mind at ease.
