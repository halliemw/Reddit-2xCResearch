A man, as an individual does not represent the interest or opinions of all men. 

In the same way a women, as an individual does not represent the interest or opinions of all women.

A woman can be more knowledgeable on issues facing men; or vise-versa. For example irrespective of gender I'm going to think an ob/gyn knows more about female reproduction than a female. That isn't to say they, assuming the ob/gyn is male, has the perspective of a female, but they certainly have more knowledge.

Issues that affect women/men are really just issues that affect humans; something we all have in common. If I say something is a "man's issue" does that mean you, as a female, immediately and axiomatically cannot hold a valuable opinion? Of course not. 


Edit: Somehow it is controversial to suggest that someone who spent 11 years studying a subject at an extreme academic level is less knowledgeable than women. In other words, "...because your race/gender/sexual orientation we're going to assume this aggregate upon the individual."
