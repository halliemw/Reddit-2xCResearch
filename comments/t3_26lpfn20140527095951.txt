I agree with the others that I sense self-loathing in your post.

What are you going to school for?  Is it something that will lead to employment?  If you "don't really want to work", why are you going to school?  

It sounds like you are lacking a sense of purpose and getting down on yourself because of it.  It sounds like you do value working and pulling your own weight, so maybe you need to take steps in that direction.  Otherwise, you need to find a way to be happy with yourself in your current situation.  It sounds like you have hangups about the way others perceive you, your question is even phrased in such a way - how to make yourself *seem* valuable to others.  I really think that's the wrong way to look at it, and you need to look inside yourself to find what will make *you* feel that *you* are valuable.  

Basically just going to school 15 hours a week shouldn't be so stressful and exhausting on its own.  I'm single and work full time, do all the household stuff including cooking for myself, and take night classes.  I still struggle with a lot of the same feelings you describe, about not doing enough or feeling worthless.  It's not just putting in the time, I really think it is a matter of finding a way to accept and love yourself, whether that means finding a career that gives you purpose or seeking therapy or whatever.  You are blessed with financial stability and lots of free time, so you should really use that time to improve yourself, whatever that means to you.  I think you will feel better.
