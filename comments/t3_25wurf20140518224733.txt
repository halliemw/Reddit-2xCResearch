Thank you. You've actually made me feel loads better. I think I read the Carnegie book years ago--might still be in my Nook library. I'll give it a once-over.

I think I'm pretty good at reading social cues--sometimes too good. I'm of an anxious temperament, and thus often fall into the trap of, "He looked away from me when he spoke. HE HATES ME." But I'm also rational and grown-up enough to nip that negative mental talk in the bud. So I doubt I'm missing things there. 

What might be more likely (at least, when I'm interacting with people in person) is that I think I might come across as a little cold. I'm not bright and extroverted and giggly, and I sometimes forget to talk if I have nothing to say. I've been working on this. (It's not that I disparage people for "making noxious noise with their mouth-holes!" or anything, I just...sometimes have nothing cogent to say.)
