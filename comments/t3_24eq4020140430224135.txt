Here's the thing (I'm an LMT): There is no way that a relaxation massage is going to impact your fetus at all. No way. BUT, the rumor is so strong and the chances of spontaneous miscarriage are so high in the first trimester that no spa is going to risk being sued by somebody who thinks they can link their miscarriage to the massage they had last week. It sucks, but spas and massage clinics have to protect their businesses. Now, you may be able to find an Arvigo Technique MT who is willing to work on you and doesn't have to answer to a corporate lawyer. Can your partner massage you or do other things to relax you? Maybe a bubble bath and neck massage?
