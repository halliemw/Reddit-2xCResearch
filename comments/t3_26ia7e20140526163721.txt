I'm larger on top, I HAVE to wear a bra :/ It's annoying because I rarely find ones that fit, and the ones that do always end up breaking after a few weeks. I've just given up on "looking modest" without bras showing. Fuck that, I need support damnit and if that means you can see my brastrap over my shoulders then that's your problem, not mine :/  
Thank god I live in the UK, people generally don't give a shit here haha
