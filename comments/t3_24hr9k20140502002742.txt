I work. I recently "accidentally" picked up a second job and now my only days off are Wednesdays and Saturdays. I go into work at 7 on Sunday so I don't go out on Saturday night. And I'm in school so I'm trying to spend my free time working on homework. 

I like to try new creative things, painting or cooking, and I like to read. I just try to stay busy and not focus too much on my serious lack of a social life. If it weren't for work or my parents, I could easily go at least a week without any real human interaction. And I try to keep myself focused on the future. I may have no social life or friends here, but I'm not planning on staying in this town forever. I have 60 years left of my life to find people and create meaningful relationships.
