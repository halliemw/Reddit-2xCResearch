So sorry that happened to you. 

If you feel well enough, Id complain just to hopefully save someone else from such insensitive treatment. 

We seem to be made to feel by society that our periods are gross and shameful. That really shouldn't be case. 

I've gotten my period unexpectedly before when i was wearing a white dress. Was sitting on my male friend's sofa at the time and he shrieked and ran for paper towels. there wasn't any even on the sofa but i was absolutely mortified. 

take solace in the fact that most women have an embarrassing period story. xxx
