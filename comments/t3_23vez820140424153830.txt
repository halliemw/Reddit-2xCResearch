Like it or not, the burden of proof is on us to support whatever assertions we are making.  Is it a pain in the ass to have to keep referring people to the same studies?  Sure, but everyone learns something new everyday.  And I think the other thing to consider is the number of countless lurkers on this website.  There are tons of people who never comment but maybe if they learn something new they're apt to change their mind.
