Yay!!! Congratulations! I had the same look on my face when I got my B.A. yesterday. Did your face go numb from smiling? I know mine did :) School is hard, many people try to finish, but only some do. Sure it takes hard work and luck to get in to college, but you finished because you put in the long hours, and you worked for it! I hope your future is a bright one!
