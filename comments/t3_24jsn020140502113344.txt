Do you have an advisor or someone else from your university supervising your student teaching that you could discuss this situation with? As in, not your supervising teacher but perhaps the education advisor for your uni or the person in charge of assigning the student teaching positions. I agree that this definitely needs to be addressed and is a very serious issue that you have a responsibility to not help perpetuate by ignoring it...but at the same time I would look to outlets that have the influences you don't have that can actually bring some authority or gravity by telling the school administration how wrong this is without making yourself out to be the one dissenting voice.  I would seek advice and help from someone who is affiliated with the student teaching program through your uni as a start.
