I think you're missing a key aspect of what you're responding to: the quantity of conventionally attractive people posting about their self-confidence versus the quantity of conventionally less attractive people posting. There is an obvious disparity that leads the commenter you're responding to reasonably conclude that conventionally attractive people generally have an easier and much less shocking journey to self-confidence... And then it's paraded around (and it's still worth celebrating, don't get me wrong!) but just makes people with a bigger struggle think "jeez, if it takes an attractive person X years to feel confident, will I ever love myself?" 

Ultimately, yes, we're all responsible for our own feelings but I don't buy for a second that all feelings are equal and should be treated equally. Some people do have bigger problems. That doesn't mean we shouldn't have compassion for all things that feel but I'm not sold on the idea that all feels are equal (or maybe even valid. Some people need to get over their shit, situation depending!).
