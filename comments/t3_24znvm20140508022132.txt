Exactly. This is my biggest concern with the sub going default. For some reason it's very common for a lot of guys to be completely dismissive of issues women face that they themselves don't experience. Generally, as it stood, this sub was a place to discuss these experiences without being told that we're being too sensitive or some other bs by some asshat who literally has no idea what he's talking about. Those guys would inevitably show up on occasion, but we were able to reinforce each other's experiences and opinions and not have our posts down-voted into obscurity (which is exactly what often happens when these topics come up in most of the rest of Reddit). My concern is that with the increased traffic this sub will now get, we will no longer be able to have meaningful discussions of these topics as our energy will be devoted to defending the validity of discussing them at all.

Yes, no one should live their entire lives in an echo chamber, but we also need a space where our views can be discussed at face value.
