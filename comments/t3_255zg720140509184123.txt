Would she feel more comfortable going to a counselor if you were there with her? Or maybe if you went to a counseling session and asked her to come with you she might be more open to it?

Have you two really discussed what's going to happen after you pass? Does she have all of your bank account passwords etc. I don't think forcing the issue on her is going to be helpful, but I just worry about what will happen when she has to face reality. Maybe involving her in your end-of-life affairs would ease her into acceptance of what's happening.
