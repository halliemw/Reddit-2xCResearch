Keep looking for another job, and when you leave give your boss as much notice as possible. All anyone can do is be thankful for the help and guidance they've been given and move on. You have to do what's best for you, just do it in a respectful way. That's all any boss would want is to be given proper notice and respect. ( at least the good ones)
