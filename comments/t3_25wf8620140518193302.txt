Not to be a slut/guard my modesty.  When I was in college my friends would go out to the bars and have casual sex most weekends.  I think ruined them mentally and they cannot keep a stable relationship, a few are divorced with kids and in their late 20s.  I going to marry my boyfriend of 4 years this summer and couldn't be happier.  I don't think girls understand this until they are older.
