I am going to differ from the other posters here but I have a father like your daughter does so hopefully you might consider my viewpoint. 

My dad barely saw me when I was younger and disappeared for years at a time. He never paid child support. He was not abusive though he was a drug addict on and off. When he did see us, it was only because my mother had guilted him into it. Little kids were too much work for him.

If he had offered to my mother to give up his parental rights, I would have hoped she would have refused. It would have been much more hurtful and difficult to come to terms with my dad not even wanting to be considered legally my father than a father who was in and out of my life. Also lots of people might criticise my mother for letting him see us when he was a drug addict and encouraged her to cut off contact on that reason but he was safe for us to spend time with and she knew this. 

As adults we get along quite well and he's much more interested in seeing and talking to me now that I am adult. I recognise he was a crappy father but AT LEAST he never gave up entirely on being my father. If your daughter's father is not abusive I wouldn't ask him to give up his parental rights. He might also become closer to her as she gets older.
