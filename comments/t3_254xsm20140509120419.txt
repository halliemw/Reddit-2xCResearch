i reckon there's a difference between sharing an opinion and freaking the fuck out. And I am part of the community, unfortunately since i don't agree with the majority, i should not be heard as well? 

I never thought i would feel so unwelcome in this sub. And it's coming from the core members taking immaturity (something they were afraid would infiltrate this sub in the firstplace) to a whole new level. But I've been told to 'just fucking leave already' 'no one will miss you' or to keep my opinions to myself.

I guess all this has made me a bit sad, really, to put it simply. that's all.
