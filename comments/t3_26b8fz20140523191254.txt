Thank you and cupcake for posting here about this, we've been doing our best to weed the legitimate criticisms and complaints from our community and we've had our suspicions about some of the posts we've seen. 

It's heartening to know that some of our suspicions were correct, though the fact that some from our community may have participated in false flagging by sending shitty PM's to some of the women here or upvoting harassing comments instead of reporting them is very disappointing to me. It doesn't make sense to me since the largest argument against us being a default is that it makes this space less safe, so you participate in making it less safe by threatening people? 

To address any concerns I'm seeing in response to you that this means there are no legitimate complaints, that's not what Deimorz said at all, just that we should question both where it's coming from and which groups are doing it and why. 

We do still know there are legitimate concerns (as deimorz reiterated at the end of his comment) and that the number of shitty PM's may have gone up.. though it's important to note here that those are not a new thing here. We've always been known to the dedicated trolls (and wider reddit) and been a target of theirs. At different times different groups have targeted us ever since the day we were created, trolls and shitty PM's are not a new thing here.

We still are reading the complaints and taking them to heart as much as we can but we, like everyone should, will continue to have that grain of salt in mind going forward.
