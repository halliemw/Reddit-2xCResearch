Also, I can't edit my post but this video clearly shows that violence perpetrated by women goes beyond women being seen as the weaker sex. Try to watch the whole video (it's only 6 minutes long)



Just in case you dont make it, basically it's an experiment where they had a woman abuse a man in public. Out of 163 people, not one intervened and many actually applauded her. When asked why, they answered that he was probably guilty. 



Yes, viewing women as the weaker sex is part of it. But not everything is as simple as you make it out to be. There IS an element of vilifying men, whether you like it or not.
