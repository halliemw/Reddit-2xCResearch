> So even if the police can't prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that the accused rapist is guilty (or even if they decline to follow up on the matter at all), the university may still find that there's sufficient evidence for them to expel that student,

The 51% burden of proof is a complete joke.  It is the lowest legal standard possible.  When you also consider the lack of evidence rules, the use of hearsay, the inability to know the full extent of changes before the trial, the lack or representation, etc its clear that this kangaroo court is not looking for justice.  This is a criminal matter and should be left to the police.
