its more gotten to the point of the discomfort tipping the weight scale more than anything. the irritation happens frequently and i constantly have to fix myself in public. i cant ever go commando. it just sucks. and no i would have to say i dont find it attractive. i dont like what i see when i look in the mirror. i guess you are supposed to love your body but .. i really. REALLY. hate it. i do not like the way it looks and i dont feel sexy when i see myself. and i dont hate anything else on me really. its not like a whole image thing. just my labia.
