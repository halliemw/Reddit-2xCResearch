"We accept the love we think we deserve."

We tend to assume that we'll learn to love ourselves through someone else's eyes, but finding the right person to do that is a shot in the dark, and attracts more abusers than anything else.

Your first challenge will be to start overlooking that voice in the back of your head telling you that you're not good enough. You will have to start noticing what it say, when it's talking, and to remind yourself that it's amplifying every possible crack in your skin (figuratively speaking). It's not a voice that suddenly shuts up. It's a continuous fight. There will be bad days. And you're allowed to feel bad. But realizing that your first and foremost enemy comes from within will help a lot.

Basically, you stand up to yourself. You have a lot more qualities than you give yourself credit for, because you overlook or downplay them. Whatever you focus on will shine through in your attitude. 

I've dealt with the same kind of problem - I recently celebrated a 10-year anniversary with my best friend and I sometimes still have trouble believing she likes to hang out with me.

If you need to talk about it, you're welcome to PM me :)
