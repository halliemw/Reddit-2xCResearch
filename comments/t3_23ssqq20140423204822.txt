Did you keep your career? Did you stay with the father, or is he still in the picture? How did you're friends and family react? Did you ever regret it? How are you now, are you happy with YOUR life? Did you have to put your dreams aside? 
I am very ambitious and want to do a lot of things like travel and move up in my career, find a great partner, buy some property etc. I'm afraid MY life will be put on the back burner. :(
