"I'd love to see you try and do it all".

I'm sorry but I really don't think that's the point. Maybe this poster couldn't do what nurses do- but he/she didn't sign up to be a nurse. If you are bad at your job, you deserve criticism for it from the patient/client/customer perspective, regardless of being overworked or whatever. There are lots of reasons, many you've just given, but that doesn't make her family member cleaner or more comfortable or less demeaned. Reasons don't actually matter. Especially since your reasons ARE good ones- ones that don't just affect a few bad nurses, but many of them. So why would the experience be expected to be different if you're saying many nurses are put under these circumstances?
