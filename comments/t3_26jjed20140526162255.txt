Just remember that they are inanimate objects, they don't "go off" accidentally and they are the perfect equalizer. Depending on how you were raised I can understand your apprehension, but you need to understand that your fears are irrational. Start small, find someone you trust, follow the rules, and you won't look at a gun any differently than a steak knife or nail clippers.

Get a dog, do that stupid windchime thing, and just remember that the gun is the last resort. Even though it's never a guarantee, nothing else in this thread even comes as close to 100% as a firearm.
