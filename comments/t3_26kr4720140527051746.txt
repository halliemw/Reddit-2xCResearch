Been there, done that. Try to remember one thing...

After you all graduate and go out into the world, these people are your connection to future jobs, not (usually) your competition. I'm not saying that you should smile and network and be fake friends with everybody. But presumably, though competition is causing strain now, you don't hate 'em all. So don't burn any bridges long-term through momentary frustration. They aren't trying to backstab and sabotage you - they're just trying to get a job too.

You will sooner or later get a position. And your skill set will then start to diverge from everyone else's. They will no longer be graduate carbon copies - just people you may work with (or for) again (almost assuredly if the field is as metaphorically incestuous as you say).

Also... I wouldn't look too harshly on a classmate not wanting to share a lead on a job they want. How would you feel if you found a job, applied for it, told someone else about it, and then they got it? Now that they have a job, ask them about anything else they may be aware of. They have far less reason to hold back now. :)
