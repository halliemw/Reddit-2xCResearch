But why?

This isn't a good example but: if person A punched person B and broken their nose, you could sue person A to have them cover medical expenses.  I am NOT AT ALL COMPARING THE TWO SITUATIONS BUT if your defense is "you are the patient, you are responsible" then that should apply in the above situation, should it not?  But it doesn't.
