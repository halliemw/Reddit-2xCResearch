Trashy is subjective.  What I think is trashy, you may think is chic.

We all have different standards, but to me, bringing your child to high school graduation pics is trashy.  

A Redneck's source of pride (child out of wedlock, crappy car you built, rebel flag flying proudly) is my way to identify them as trashy.
