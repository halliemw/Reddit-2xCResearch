My personal favorite way to mark anything is with a big yummy decadent meal. Something I around  my high school and college graduations was walk through the campus by myself when there weren't many people around and think about how hard I'd worked and what I accomplished. It felt really nice and gave me a bit of closure on a place I'd spent so much time in
