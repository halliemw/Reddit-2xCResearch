I dress fairly conservatively but I walk pretty damn assertively. The one time a would-be thief put his hand on my shoulder to try to pull off my purse, I instantly assumed an aggressive posture, full in facing him and bellowed, "GET THE FUCK OFF ME!"

He turned tail and ran.

All this to say while meek, submissive people may tend to dress conservatively, not all conservatively dressed people are meek and/or submissive.
