Ok, so can you give us some parameters for what's reportable? Does it have to be outright hateful or can it be that more subtle gaslighting and derailing? I just had an argument in another post by a guy who was complaining that he sometimes browses reddit logged out and doesn't want to see our niche interests on his reddit. I think I eventually told him to fuck off... 
 
erm, so anyway. Could I have reported him, for example?
