I watched that movie while drinking but I have to ask, wasn't the part where she cheered just another construct? That didn't actually happen, it was all part of the test. 

Personally I felt insulted when I realized that the cheering and congratulations were only part of her test and never actually happened. It was like the movie was saying there was no way this would happen in reality, you just hope it does but then you're let down. 

Which... is the truth but damn it they had a chance to change the trend.
