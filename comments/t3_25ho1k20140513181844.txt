Seriously?! Your female co-workers said that was a bitch move? Unbelievable. 

You did nothing wrong. You have a schedule, a routine that has been little changed for 3 years. All of a sudden it is up ended and you ask someone in charge what is going on. That is a completely normal response. Don't even let them try to put you down, you did nothing wrong.

It also sounds like your boss is trying to pass on your hours to her niece. Is it possible for you to get an explanation of exactly what your role and hours are? I write them all the time for my employees here in Ireland but I get things might be different where you are.
