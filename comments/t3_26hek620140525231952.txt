My mom grew up pretty poor in rural America, so she didn't really have a lot of stuff to give me. She didn't even get to keep her own wedding dress because it was her aunt's, and her cousin took it right after the ceremony. BUT I do have a lot of outfits she made for me as a child, she used to sew me things. She and my great aunt even sewed doll clothes for my barbies. 

She lost of lot of her childhood things from moving around a lot, so she has boxes and boxes of stuff for us that she kept, even if we don't want it right now, "just in case one day you want to look back."
