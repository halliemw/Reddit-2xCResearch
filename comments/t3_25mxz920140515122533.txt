Your drawings are fantastic! Do I spy some fanart in there?

I'd say go for it. Even if nothing comes of it, and it remains a hobby, if you enjoy it then it is in no way a wasted experience. You may not get this opportunity again, so go for it! If you let that shitty little voice talk you out of it you will always wonder "What if" and it will weigh on your mind for years. It's a great opportunity, and if nothing else it's like a mini holiday to focus solely on a hobby you clearly love, and it definitely sounds like you've earnt that if nothing else.

Let us know what you decide!
