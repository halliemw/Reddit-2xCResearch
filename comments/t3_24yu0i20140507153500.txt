I understand how you feel completely. My SO got a job in a different state and I moved there with him. My job search lasted a year...and I was doing an unpaid internship/ volunteering during that time.

He paid for everything. It was a really difficult struggle for me but I was able to change my thinking which helped. I did all the cooking/cleaning/ domestic duties which was a big contribution to our household. I was not providing money to our household but I was providing a useful and relevant service.

My advice to you would be to find some other significant way to contribute to your household other than finances. Also, do some volunteering while you are doing your job search. It helps get you out of the house and gives you something exciting/positive to focus on.

Something else that always helped me was to talk about it with my SO or someone else who was close to me. That was I was able to get reassurance that I was not a lazy moocher. That I was just contributing in a different way. I made some sacrifices to move there with my SO , and he was asking some sacrifices for me. It worked out in the end.


Also I wanted to add that it helps sometimes just to think about alternative plans. Say he did kick you out would you have somewhere to go? I know for me I could always move in with my parents and I always had that option. If you don't it would be worthwhile to at least think about contingency plans.

As for the joint checking...if you don't have any income honestly it will probably be easier for you both to do it that way. My so had to write checks for me when I needed to refill my account. Plus its not like you won't be contributing to the joint checking in the future!
