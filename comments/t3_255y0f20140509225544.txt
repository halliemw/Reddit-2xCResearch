so if you are still interested in making Harem pants, I would recommend picking up one of the Drape Drape books. They have some seriously awesome patterns. If you are brave/can read Japanese and are willing to dedicate some time to figuring out what the hell you are suppose to do, the first one has some excellent patterns for pants. However [Drape Drape 3](http://smile.amazon.com/Drape-3-Hisako-Sato/dp/1780671008/ref=smi_www_rcol_go_smi?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0) is in English and has one pants pattern. 

edit: Hey all the Drape Drape books on amazon are in English now lol I may have re-buy all of them.
