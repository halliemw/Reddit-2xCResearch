Could be true. A lot of people pretend to be super "edgy" with their humor, making everyone else cringe in the process.

Of course, then you've gotta wonder what kind of man thinks stuff like that is funny, it's a lot like racist jokes in a way - feel free to tell them, but don't be surprised if people back away slowly from you as soon as you do. ;)
