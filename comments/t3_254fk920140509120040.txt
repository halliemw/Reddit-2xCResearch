I'll second this, even though I was far more creative with other toys than barbies. The problem with barbies was their size: they were too big to coordinate with my other toys and their legs don't bend. I played with my Playmobil doll house (the old Victorian one) and Littlest Pet Shop (before they turned into bug-eyed aliens) because they were smaller and worked fairly well together.
