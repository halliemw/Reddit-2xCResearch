If it is truly postpartum, don't hold it against her. It's just brain chemistry saying those things to you, not your wife.

Have her answer these [questions](http://psychology-tools.com/epds/) and see what the score is.

If she is truly clinically depressed (postpartum or otherwise) don't ignore it. Get her some treatment and things will likely get better for the both of you.
