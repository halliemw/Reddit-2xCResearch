You're welcome! It's definitely a challenge to be the partner of someone with a mood disorder (if that's what's going on), so you should definitely build your own support network...whether it's family, friends, your own therapist. Just ask my husband :) or anyone in a LTR with bipolarity. It's a rollercoaster and we can scare the hell out of you (hell, we scare the hell out of ourselves sometimes). 

But you seem like a wonderful and caring wife, and that will go a long way. Just make sure you take care of yourself too.
