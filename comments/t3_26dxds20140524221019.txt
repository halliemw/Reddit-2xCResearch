I wear [tactical boots](http://www.batesfootwear.com/US/en-us/Product.mvc.aspx/8472W/10456/Womens/8-inch-Tactical-Sport-Side-Zip-Boot) for work. I was buying a new pair and couldn't find them in stores ANYWHERE. All these stores carry them online, but they only sell the men's boots in stores.. I can't blame them really because these boots are typically worn by police, and I feel confident saying the majority of police officers are probably men. But still. Grrr. I hate ordering shoes online because I have very small feet (size five..but sometimes 5.5 or 6 depending on the brand!) and some brands do sizing differently.. so it's a pain. However, thank goodness for free overnight shipping with zappos! That takes a load off my shoulders. And yes, I did end up getting lucky with my first order being the one that fit.
