You are not a whore. Nobody is a whore. Whore is an ugly put down word, just like nigger and kike. Shun away from it. 

You don't get a medal for never holding hands and having sex outside a relationship, it's a choice among many, not an option better than the other. Have as much sex as you want, provided you are honest and upfront about your intentions, safe, and clean. That is all there is to it.
