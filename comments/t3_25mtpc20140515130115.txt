You're right, I could have googled DHA but I didn't. Guilty of sloth. And if you read the post, you'd know I wasn't originally asking about the dangers of UV Tanning; I was asking if anyone with more experience than myself could give me advice on how often to go. What I received in response was a lot of people warning me not to go at all. Someone offered Mystic Tan as an option I'd never researched it and since they offered it I assumed they were more knowledgeable than me so I asked about it. So I guess I'm also guilty of being curious. My deepest apologies.
