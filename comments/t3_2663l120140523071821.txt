I guess it would have to be a case-by-case basis. Most classical art is viewed as pornographic (i.e., not meant to sexually arouse the viewer) by a modern audience (of course, the ancient Greeks or Romans might've considered these statues to be arousing). 
Classical art tends to romanticize rape, which is something I find distasteful, but it also tends to be less graphic [in the example you provided and in many others (such as "The Rape of Europa" or "Rape of the Sabine Women"), there is no penetration; the art shows the moment leading to the rape, but not the rape itself]. 
We also don't have the artist here to tell us that message (if any) he or she was intending to convey with the art in question; it's open to interpretation. One could say, "this piece clearly shows us that rape is a bad thing," but another person could say, "no, I think it glorifies it." It leads to an interesting discussion, if anything.
