Hm, I can think of many shops that are like this. In order to compete with them (which is hard because they're relatively inexpensive) I think you would have to focus on a specialty you offer.

How would your store set its self apart from other business-casual shops? I wish you had already prepared some suit and shirt designs for us to see. I like the idea of tailoring, but other places already offer that as well. Maybe you could make classy business attire from organic, fair-trade sources? I would be interested in that! Most clothing places like that only offer hippy/bohemian style clothing.
