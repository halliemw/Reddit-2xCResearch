I'm having a hard time thinking of any blatant sexism incidents, and I have not been sexually assaulted.

I think it's because of how I've structured my life, though. I'm not a partier at all, I'm pretty fat and unattractive, I don't like live music (so not a lot of time at venues), I'm pretty introverted and I live in a place where everyone commutes by car and you're wearing winter clothes for like 7 months of the year. Plus my part of the world tends to put on a polite face in public and then rag on people in private.

I think I got hit on by a random Japanese salaryman in Tokyo...kinda hard to tell when you can't speak the language, but he wouldn't leave me alone so I just left the store. Does that count?
