It does not change the public, or rather my, personal, perception. You can't tell me that a community named "against men's rights" *advocates* men's rights *where appropriate*. That's absurd. Spending a day in their subreddit proves the absurdity.  

I'm going to presume your last sentence deals with "what defines" a sexual assault victim. In which case I'll pique that both parties trying to foist blame or who has it worse are both wrong.  

We should be constructing a society that diminishes the possibility of the crime. Not raise the stakes and punishments. We'll be a prison society yet if MRA and AMR made up the majority of a two party fight.
