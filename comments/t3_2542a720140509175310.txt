I got a similar comment when I went in for the preliminary appointment and had to get an ultrasound.  It looked like a little bean to me so it helped me to dehumanize it, but I know my mother appreciated having the ultrasound picture since it's the closest thing she's ever getting to a human grandbaby and the whole event solidified that for her and made it possible for her to let it go.
