I would say you sound like a GREAT human being. Regarding being lumped in, know that you are not one of the men we are talking about. You are the kind of person we wish those people could be. The campaign is about enlightening those who are unaware of these issues (in hopes of change) and showing support to those affected. You are the ideal activist. And I would personally like to say thank you. I was just talking to someone earlier wondering if there could be a hashtag like #menagainstmisogyny that shows support instead of the invalidating comments coming from #notallmen.
