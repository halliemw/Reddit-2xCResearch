Maybe if it happened once you might think that--but when it happens more than once, or several times a week.  When the guys get aggressive when you don't respond or follow right after you for a few paces.  When they repeatedly ask for your number and don't back down.  When they are obnoxious and constant and infringing on your personal space--it begins to be a real pain in the ass.

It's not a compliment when a stranger comments on my sexual organs.   That's bullshit and you well know it.  

No one is saying it's the end of the world but it's:

1.  Not a compliment.

2.  Not a pleasant thing to have to deal with.

3.  A repeated pain in the ass for many women trying to go about their own damn business.

This may not be something that's an issue for you in your life--but you seem to be ignoring all of the posts in the thread that are detailing specifically why it is a problem, try reading those.
