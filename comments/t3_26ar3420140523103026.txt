While its your body and you can do what you want, you guys are married. Is this tattoo that important that you are willing to make your husband this upset about it? Maybe he doesnt find tattoos covering half the arm attractive. What if he said he was going to do some body mod you found really unappealing, wouldnt you want him to take your opinion into consideration?
