Oh my gosh I'm so happy I can delete the comments! I only ever access instagram from my phone so I didn't know you could do it from the desktop... I guess that makes sense now though that I'm thinking of it. 

I reported all of them to both instagram and campus police and have screenshots of the ones that are still there (some have disappeared because the account was deleted apparently). Hopefully now everything will start going away :)
