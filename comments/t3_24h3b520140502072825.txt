I'm so sorry for your loss.

I've had a number of friends lose their alcoholic parents. (I suppose it is no coincidence that alcoholics tend to die youngish.)

It's the same damn thing every time - awful mixed feelings, none of them good. And it boils down to this: every kid of an alcoholic privately dreams that one day, their parent will choose THEM over the alcohol. When the parent dies, that can never happen. It's a double loss.

The only thing I can offer is a phrase. When people ask questions (usually, "Were you close?") you can say, "It was a complicated relationship." People seem to understand that phrase - they know you're in pain, but you're not idealizing the person you lost. And they generally don't pry any further.
