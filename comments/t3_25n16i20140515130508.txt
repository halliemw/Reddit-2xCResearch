Wow. I can totally sympathize with both sides of this. I've been that girls who's bff is in a horribly toxic relationship, who feels like she has to be the support system but it's incredibly draining. I've also been that girl in that incredibly toxic relationship who just can't let go because it could be the best love ever if he just didn't have these problems....

She's not gonna get out until she has an epiphany on her own. No amount of cajoling or rationalizing or supporting on your part is going to make her see the reality of the situation. That has to come from her. 

You have to create boundaries. It sucks, but you just do. Otherwise, she's going to completely drain you of all your energy which - as you say - is going to ruin the healthy relationships you have. You just have to not engage. "Katie, I've told you my views on this. I'm very sorry you're having such a hard time, but you're choosing to be in this relationship. I can't talk about this any more. You know you can always call me in an emergency, but I cannot continue to support you when you are making dangerous choices for yourself." 

You really do have to view it like she's an addict. You can't continue to be her crutch while she makes choices that will destroy her life. You're just enabling her. 

I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Good luck!
