For me, one of the worst/scariest parts about the whole "35" thing is that what if it's not obvious to you if you want to have kids or not?


I'm 30, have never wanted children, but am open to the possibility that I could change my mind. I am terrified that I won't want any up until the point that I suddenly *do*, probably because it's been drummed into me that the "biological clock takes over" or that I'm certain to change my mind, or whatever. What if that need suddenly hits me at 40? 


Financial and emotional concerns aside, it's not as simple as "if you want kids, just have them earlier". What if you don't *want* them earlier? It's all very confusing. I have no idea if I'll ever want to have them, but if I do change my mind, I guess I'd better hope it's sooner rather than later. It would seem a shame to go half a lifetime not wanting kids when you can have them, only to change your mind once it's too late... :(
