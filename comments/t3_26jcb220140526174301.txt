In my opinion the biggest problem about the radical pro-life movement is that they don't really seem to care about the children, they just want to prove they are right. If they really cared they would promote contraception, as you said, or actually support the mothers who decide not to have an abortion (since some of them decide about abortion for financial reasons or can't raise a special needs child on their own, for example). But no, they just want to shame and hate on women who don't conform to their rules. And motivate all this with morality and religion.
