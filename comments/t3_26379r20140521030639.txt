It makes me sad that women who look like her feel that way. My girlfriend is half black half Mexican and she hates these parts of her as well. I adore them. They are beautiful. Her full lips and kinky hair are gorgeous. I am envious. It makes my flat mousy brown hair look lame. And her beautiful skin!! Wow it's just amazing. She's always dark and wonderful. I'm really light and you can see the blue veins under my skin. When we go out during summer I end up lobster red. 

I guess that is the long way to say that I wish things were different and that she could see herself and others the way I do. 

I think it's true that we need more diversity in film. I don't want my children growing up feeling any shame in how they look.
