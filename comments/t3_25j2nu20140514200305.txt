Conflict minerals out of the congo is a huge issue, though whether it's forced labour of adults at the hands of warlords or if it's children enslaved are two different issues. You can buy conflict free coltan and some companies have signed on to ensure they buy conflict free minerals. I can't remember where you can find a list of which companies investigate the origins of their coltan and tin but it's out there. Not all mobile phones (though Nokia for sure) use conflict minerals.
