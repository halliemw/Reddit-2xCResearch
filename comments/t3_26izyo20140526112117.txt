Yikes. I've only heard of chemical castration as a solution presented in feminist circles to the problem of men who can't and don't control their sexual urges and who repeatedly force themselves on others. I'm glad I don't run in your circles where people say this kind of thing and I'm sorry you do.

Personally, I always welcome more birth control options. I believe I understand why it's taken so long to get to the point of having viable male hormonal birth control, and I'm glad we're making advances in this arena.
