>The lady who posted the other day about her rapist being invited to the wedding she was maid-of-honor at posted a PM she got because of that over on creepypms. It was vile.

I like the internet being anonymous.  But I really hate it when people abuse that to do sick stuff like that.  Honestly, I don't even understand people like that.  Reads a story about a 12 year old who was raped and almost murdered and decides to go and send something like that to the woman that girl grew up into?  I honestly just can't understand them.
