Have you tried depilatory creams? Epilators?

I just googled "armpit make-up", and there were a lot of hits but nothing promising...

If you are looking the laser hair removal route, groupon seems to have a lot of deals.

I know it doesn't help, but for what it's worth, you're guaranteed to be the person thinking/looking at your armpits most of the time. I've so very rarely noticed armpits on other people.
