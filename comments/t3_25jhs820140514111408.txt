I felt ashamed because I had my period, and I bled so much that I overflowed every single pad I used.  

THEN my parents decided I was limited to 1 pad per day.  As if I could control the amount of blood that my uterus discharged.  

Oh, and boobs.  I had boobs.  I had boobs that grew from flat to DD in one summer when I was a cheerleader.  Never even kissed a guy and I had a bad reputation.  Because boobs.
