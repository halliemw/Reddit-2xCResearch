kids will be kids. what else do you want them to be? what else are you going to expect them to be? also people will be people, and OP has every right to feel violated, she also has every right not to feel violated. after all she was just a kid, and kids don't know what to do in those situations, they don't know how to think about it, or to feel about it, but the memory can last into adulthood and it can be haunting, and people are people. 

i am sure if the other girl in this story remembers it she also feels guilty and bad about it. but neither of them should forget that kids will be kids, and even though the memory is hurtful they aren't really responsible, they were just doing what they knew and didn't know how to do. it sucks that it happened, but there is no more blame to be placed than the ocean waves crashing against the shore.
