No, that's not what pervasive means in this context.

Here, pervasive means there are multiple events: each individual event might not be very severe on its own, but taken as a whole, they add up to a larger picture of repeated harassment.

That's clearly not what's going on in her case, since there was only one isolated event, and it doesn't sound very severe at all.
