Well because no one pays me to go to school. I should be allowed to wear what I want. Young adults are not stupid, they know there's a difference between what you'd wear to a job and what you'd wear to school. I wear stuff to school I'd never show up to a job in, that doesn't mean it's inappropriate in all situations
