If you're in the US, you should know that they don't recommend doing Paps on anyone younger than 21. They may want to do a pelvic exam and they may insist on an STI screening just because many teenagers and people in general lie about being sexually active for different reasons, and it's better to do an unnecessary screening than to let an STI go untreated. They should not do an actual Pap until she's 21, because doing them too young results in a lot of overtreatment and that can contribute to cervical incompetence and that sort of thing.
