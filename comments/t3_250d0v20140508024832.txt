Hey there, I've had these feelings to, not about the leaving me part, but whenever the idea of what life might be like if my wife dies I can't help but tear up and sit in the corner for a few minutes. The only thing that helps me with that is religion. Sorry if that doesn't help, I wish I had better advice! But I do empathize.
