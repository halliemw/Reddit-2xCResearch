It's easier to downvote. It's also because the only way they could really argue against my point was to say that my experiences are wrong, which you can't really do. There isn't really an argument to have with me about the topic due to those things. 

Yeah, your story is pretty similar to mine. It doesn't stop it from hurting at all and it really really sucks, but there isn't really anything you CAN do about it. I mean, all these people are ranting that, 'It's not jealousy' but it really doesn't matter because OP asked for solutions. The solutions are not ideal, but they are the only ones you can do in this circumstance.
