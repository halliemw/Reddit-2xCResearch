>It could be worse: Your parents could have heard you having intense sex. Ha!

It could be much worse than that.  Like neither neighbors nor parents ever hearing anything because there was no sex at all in the picture.   :)


At OP:  Just own it.  You didn't do it with the intent to bother them.  You realized it has been bothering them, you apologized sincerely and you're committed to be more considerate of their needs of quiet enjoyment from here on. Basically, you have done everything that you *can* do.    

Don't beat yourself over this, it was an just a mistake, and an honest one.  Embarrassing situations happen every now and then, we can't avoid them.  Give it some time, and I am sure the anxiety will subside, and you will learn how to better navigate this feeling of embarrassment.    Be good to yourself til then, don't be locked up at home! Go out and breathe and give yourself a ~~threat~~ treat!  Girl, you made an honest mistake, you didn't commit a crime.

**EDIT**:  Please don't give yourself a threat, give yourself a treat!   :)
