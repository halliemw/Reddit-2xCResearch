It's basically the same as self-tanners in the drugstore except the application is faster and easier. They spray a chemical (DHA) on your skin evenly and all across your skin. DHA is not a dye, stain or paint, but causes a chemical reaction with the amino acids in the dead layer on the skin surface that turns them darker.. 

Mystic tans sometimes also have a bronzer in them that gives you the instant effect of tan, but the bronzer will wash off and the DHA effect will last for a few days, sometimes up to a week or two.
