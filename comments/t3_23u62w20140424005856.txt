that was mainly what they threatened to drag me in for. Due to said history no. Just. No. 

Dealing with that uncomfortable (as in I would have to be black out drunk to consent) situation and figuring out how to get checked out is. Uhm. Difficult. I understand pap smears. 

They wanted to take me in for one after one sexual partner. With absolutely no cancer in my family. Ever. At all. Apparently everyone died in their sleep or of a heart attack. Which is no where near those organs.
