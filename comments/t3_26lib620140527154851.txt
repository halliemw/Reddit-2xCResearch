I'd like to say that simply sharing was a huge relief for me. I've seen a therapist for years and have never mentioned this. I feel a mixture of shame and a feeling that it's not a big deal. And maybe it kind of isn't, in the grand scheme of things. There are children experiencing much, much worse than I did. But I'd like to push for openness and honesty with parents and their kids. If Tina had been able to tell her parents' anything, would she have felt the need to do what she did? I certainly will be open and honest with my kids, and outline to them what kinds of play are okay and not okay, and when they need to tell me. I really think better parenting will help out a lot as a preventative measure.
