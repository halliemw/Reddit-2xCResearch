There are a lot of things that suck about being a woman, yes, but it's not all bad :P 

Seriously, you are off to a great start just by being aware of this sort of thing. A lot of men aren't, so they have no awareness of the particular challenges that their daughters might face that are different from what their sons might face. 

You say that you don't know how you're going to talk to her about things - all anyone can ask is that you do your best, honestly. Take this sub-reddit as a chance to get some insight into what women think and talk and worry about!

Most importantly, the best thing that you can do to help your daughter is to raise her to be strong and independent. Encourage her to do new things and support her when she shows new interests, whether it's dancing or soccer or working on cars. Encourage her to stand up for herself. Really listen to her if she ever brings something to you, especially when she gets older. 

Just keep in mind that nobody expects you to be perfect.
