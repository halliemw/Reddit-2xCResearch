As a woman, I actually never thought of or noticed this before.... We are so desensitized to seeing women strip down in men's music videos (hello, "Blurred Lines"), but when a woman strips down in her own music video (Miley Cyrus, Rihanna), it's totally unacceptable. Why is this? How is it objectification if a woman expresses her sexuality in her own music video? What's the difference between the two? 

I actually love what Jennifer Lopez did in "I Luh Ya Papi." She completely reversed the roles, and for some reason a lot of people hated the video because she was "objectifying men." I think, if you want to get naked and use your sexuality as a form of expression, more power to you! I don't think you're objectifying yourself.
