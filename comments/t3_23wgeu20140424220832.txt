Don't trust urban dictionary.  That's just some crap that someone thought sounded good.  

There's a song called Broken Wing which is about a woman escaping an abusive relationship.  I'm not a country music fan, so I'm not familiar with the song.  Perhaps he was referencing that song.

[Check](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070616191154AABdnym) this out.  Here are some people's interpretation of that song.  

Here's the quote from Martina McBride about her thoughts:  "And if anybody asks, you can tell them that no, she didn't jump out the window!! That thought never crossed my mind until someone asked me that after they had heard the song... **to me the song is about this woman's unbreakable spirit**, and I always thought she just left, and the window and the curtains were symbolic of her "flying away" and finding her freedom. I talked with the writers and that's definitely what they had in mind when they wrote the song." 

EDIT: I see this was mentioned above.
