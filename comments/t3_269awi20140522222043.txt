When did your doctor advise you to make a follow up appointment with her?  If she didn't say, I'd make it for as soon as possible, to get going on a plan of care that she will help create for you.  She can give you referrals of names of the other doctors/healthcare providers that you need.  It sounds like there are a lot of treatment avenues that can help your quality of life.  It will take multiple visits to your primary care doctor/specialists at the beginning, and then the intervals will get longer as treatment is established and going well.  But your primary care doctor is the one to start off with seeing again to help direct you.  (feel free to switch to a new one if you are uncomfortable with the one you saw, you can ask to speak with the nurse for recommendations, or, you can just pick another name from the list of available docs.  This is how I found my gyne whom I love) Best of luck!  

Also, did your doc advise you start on vitamins?  Alcohol can cause some deficiencies especially if you don't have a great diet.  You may need at least a general multivitamin.
