You totally can and that's why many people get a second opinion about many things! One doctor isn't the end all be all of doctors. They are providing a service, if they are not going to provide the level of care that you want, you are perfectly within your rights to take your money elsewhere. Especially with a doctor that can get more personal than others. I've had doctors tell me they couldn't do things when they actually could.
