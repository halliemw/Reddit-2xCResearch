I didn't spend four years just learning grammar. No English professor spends their time teaching their students how to make sure your grammar is 100% perfect, 100% of the time. Most of those things can be fixed through the editing process, so any respectable English student or professor would understand that those easy mistakes are common, forgivable, and easily edited out. This is because an English student or professor understands that nothing should be published or turned in for a grade unless it has been thoroughly edited for these kinds of mistakes.

Since this was meant to be a rant and not a professional paper, I didn't edit it for those mistakes. I'm sure that you are quite capable of comprehending that these kinds of mistakes are normal and understandable, especially in an informal setting. Saying that it's strange that an English major makes grammar errors is like finding it strange that a Computer Scientist's code didn't work the first time the wrote it, or that it's strange that a scientist's hypothesis wasn't correct the first time they ran an experiment. Those are not the priorities of people in those fields, and the same can be said with the English field.
