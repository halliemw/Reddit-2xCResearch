Well, with a little stretching of the the skin with your fingers it is similar to shaving an ankle or around the nose if you were a guy. (You pull the "hairy parts" away from the "sensitive parts,"  I use a good quality safety razor (I think a beard trimmer might only be used on the "front patch") and once everything has been shaved in general (starting from scratch it could take a while) for maintenance, I can whip that baby out in about a minute (3 if pre-date prep).
