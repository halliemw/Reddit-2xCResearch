That is most assuredly a big difference. For me the threat lies in social stigma (and a remote possibility of a male friend white knighting on her behalf). I have experienced being slapped/hit/thrown beer bottles at as a response to a "no", but as you say, being a large man negate that threat efficiently. I do think the level of both experienced and real threat varies geographically - I live in a Nordic country, at while many do feel threatened, compared to Nigeria (or even USA) the higher level of gender and social equality has bettered this I suspect.

As a man I certainly understand that the implied threat of violence is there for most women (and smaller men), I often wonder how anyone dears walk home at night in dodgy areas of town - and that's from a guy that is in the larger/stronger spectrum and spends a large about of my free time on a mat getting beat up by my best buddies. It is hard for me to understand how it would be the weakest/least dangerous person in the room at all times.

As a side note , in Norway i think 80-85 % of victims of violent crimes are men, so statistically men are far more likely to be victims - at the same time I don't think men feel that reality when out and about, do you think that relates to an on average higher Vance of defending yourself?
