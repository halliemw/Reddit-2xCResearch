Kinda corny, but a lot of self-reflection. Am I happy with myself? Why? Why not? If not, what can I change to fix that? Do I even want to change or learn to accept and embrace what I'm not happy with? Why am I unhappy with those things in the first place? Do they really matter? You are so much more than your body. 

For months I wondered what was so horrible about me that this guy abandoned all of his feelings for me without explanation. I couldn't find a single thing I did wrong... I wasn't dishonest with him and I was everything he claimed to have wanted. Eventually I just accepted it was him, not me, that was "wrong".

It's so cliche, but self-love is so important in all of this. The relationship that followed all of this struggled early on because I was simultaneously looking for external validation while not believing I deserved it. Eventually I realized I could never genuinely trust the love of others if I didn't love myself. And once you love yourself, you end up not needing validation from others. Finding and focusing on the things I liked about myself (physical and non-physical, even if I thought no one else did) was the key in all of this.

I'm not big on feminist theory, but bell hook's "Communion" really helped with perspective and understanding about why we seek external validation. You should give it a read, even if you think it's all bullshit. Even the first few chapters are insightful.
