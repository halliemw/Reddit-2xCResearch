Not necessarily. Society tends to tell guys that persistence gets rewarded, so when they hear "sorry, not interested," they add a mental "yet" to the end of it. That's not true for all men, of course, but it is true for some. But many of them when they hear "I have a boyfriend" will back off because they respect the relationship or because they don't want to break up a relationship or maybe because they have ethical problems with cheating and don't want to be involved even if it isn't their relationship on the line. This isn't true of all guys, to be sure, but I certainly don't think that all men who leave women alone when they hear "I have a boyfriend" are only doing it out of respect for another man's ownership.
