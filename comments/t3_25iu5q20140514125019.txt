Also, does no one think about how a guy dresses might make the girls at the prom start thinking impure thoughts?  At my prom I was undressing the boys in tuxedos with my eyes (but keeping it to myself, of course).  Do they not think young women can lust after young men, or do they just not care if they do?  Or are they saying that even if both genders lust after the other, only men are the ones unable to control their actions?  All of it is pretty offensive.
