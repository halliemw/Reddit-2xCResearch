Oh God, one of my close friends had the same experience with breast growth. On top of being in pain constantly, she never had proper underwear because the only thing that would fit her her mother considered "too mature." The boys in the class tormented her endlessly, constantly flicking and groping at her breasts, which is obviously unwelcome in regular circumstances, but even worse with the pain she was experiencing. If you want to be a good sister OP, if this happens to your sister please ensure she has proper undergarments, regardless of their appearance.
