I understand breakage but - genuine question - how would highlighting it cause it to fall out? Also, I don't seem to have any breakage from the highlights - at least not that I've noticed. 

As for curling.... sigh. Thanks to my Scandinavian heritage my hair is stick straight and screams when I bend it around a curling iron (ha ha). I'm not afraid of doing the work (at all) but it just doesn't last. As a matter of fact, I have tried to curl it often at the crown but any curls at all don't show. They just... aren't there. My hair is too smooth and thin and flat to hold them, even before combing/brushing. I do try to curl it at the ends (either with a round brush or with a curling iron). These curls fall out over the course of my morning (sometimes before I even get to work) and then it gets stringy so I wind up putting it behind my ears. 

The only way it works is to shampoo, no conditioner, blow dry upside down almost all the way, use a round brush from the crown to the ends, and then a TON of super-sticky hair spray. By the time I get to work my hair is loose and moves fine. At the end of the day it's still flat and hanging though. My hair length is just below my ears in a blunt cut with bangs and a just a touch of layers.
