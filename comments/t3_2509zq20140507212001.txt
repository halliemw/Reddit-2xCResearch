I can't guess the down voters' motivation but we should respond by revving up our upvoting. Before today I hardly ever bothered voting because the posts I saw would already have tons of comments and only ~35 votes total, we just didn't pay attention before. I will always vote now. Every post will be graced in orange or blue.
