You will need to search very hard for someone who is against male genital mutilation but thinks that female genital mutilation is a perfectly valid practice that should continue.

I'm fairly sure it does not exist, but this is not true the other way around.

The reason why they talk about it is geographic relevance and the fact that people turn a blind eye on it. FGM is illegal everywhere in the Western world already. That doesn't mean it stops being an issue, but if you're going to approach this from the angle of cultural superiority/barbarism (something a lot of people do), charity starts at home. Sweep your front door first.

Tackling this issue from the angle of bodily integrity instead of a gender specific approach which downplays one or the other  prevents you from falling into this trap.
