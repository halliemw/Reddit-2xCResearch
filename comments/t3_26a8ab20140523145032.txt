It's not rape simply because you're somewhat impaired.  The line is set an incapacitation.  If you're sober enough to make a conscious choice to engage in sex, then you've consented.

Why do super hardline feminists always have to make things personal?  You can never just discuss a question or an issue.  Instead you have to call people names and attack their motives.  First, I'm a hetero woman.  Second, I don't engage in random hookups and never really have.  So no, you'll actually have to make an argument this time and not just rely on your usual character assassination when it comes to those who dare disagree with you.
