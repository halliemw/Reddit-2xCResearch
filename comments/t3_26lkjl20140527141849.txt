Actually, the thread is about refusing sexual advances, a completely different thing. Now if you consider every breakup to be 100% about refusing sex to men... well you might want to stop objectifying people and relationships in general to be nothing more than ways to give and get sex...

Yep, I noticed that the statistics were wrong after posting (Good catch), I used the USA road statistics, but the UK crime statistics, which is my bad. To use a better statistic, 200 people a year die from drowning in the UK, yet this is hardly considered a societal problem.

And the analogy still fits, regardless of your attempt at analogies. The fact is that a small minor minority of people (Majority of this minor minority men) are sick enough in the head to objectify others to the count that they are willing to take their lives. A small minor minority of people die when something with water goes wrong. Both are individually a tragedy for the people involved, yet don't happen on enough of a scale to call it a 'Societal problem'.
