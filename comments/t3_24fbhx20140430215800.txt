Sounds like a girl you don't know very well messed up and is trying to make herself feel better by blaming you. Maybe she honestly thinks it's your fault. IMO, if she were organized she would have realized she *couldn't* miss the things scheduled after and would have told you so. I guess she honestly thought she could miss those things/come late but was reprimanded. Maybe she even forgot about the second thing and that's why she didn't mention it to you.

IMO, try to be civil, but if this basket case has an issue with you maybe that says more about her than you and it won't be a major loss.


But yeah...sometimes people are needlessly obnoxious.
