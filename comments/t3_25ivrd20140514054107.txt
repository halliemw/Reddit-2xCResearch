The author managed to be clueless and condescending at the same time, he was sort of the Buddhist harasser.He clearly admits the age difference between them made him suspect the relations would end. He also reminds us he has money. So the real issue that he does want to admit is that his ego was bruised because some younger woman dumped him first and how dare she? He then says he just happened to go to a cafe where she worked and says she seemed angry. Sure dude you continue to contact her until she says not to then you show up where she works a long time after, she was stressed out because she thinks you're weird.

I do think he was right to say men don't get the same support from friends when they grieve a break up and it would have been a far more interesting article if he had just explored that aspect.
