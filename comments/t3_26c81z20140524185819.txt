I think a good thing to do is to get rid of all the junky goods on the house (with her permission, of course!) it's not just diabetics who find it hard to change eating habits, it's a lot of people. I wish my mum would eat better, she is at risk for heart disease, but she refuses. She says eating is something she's really passionate about. I've been trying for years to help her eat better, but now I've realized I can't force her to. She's also fairly depressed and refuses to see a psychiatrist (favoring alternate medicine instead...hypnosis etc) so I think that has a big role to play! 

The best thing to do is to look into ways to make healthier good taste better. There are loads of recipes online, and probably a whole bunch of subreddits devoted for it.
