so, you slept with a guy you are not in a formal relationship with, now you're testing positive and you don't want to have the kid. 

if you're worried about what he'll react with then go get the abortion and *afterwards* you can decide if you feel like telling him about what happened. 

he's not your boyfriend, he's not your husband, in terms of STI's he can't catch pregnancy off you, and you don't want to have his kids. so, it's ultimately none of his business. it is especially none of his business if your gut is telling you he might react badly to the news. 

you owe him nothing. 

the whole "he wanted me to be his girlfriend, I didn't want to be serious" thing is flying some Chinese parade ground size red flags for me right now. I had a friend drop out of medschool over an unplanned pregnancy orchestrated by a clingy dude who wanted to trap her in his life. she is very happy now with her new husband and her son is a beautiful kid, but I'd hate to see something like that happen to you and your dreams.
