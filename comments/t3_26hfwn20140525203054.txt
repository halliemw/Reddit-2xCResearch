I know this sounds crazy, but Walmart has an amazing retro swimsuit in an array of colors. It's called the [Catalina Swimsuit](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Suddenly-Slim-by-Catalina-Women-s-Slimming-Shirred-Halter-One-Piece-Swimsuit/29507937). It's super affordable ($33) and when I feel really body conscious this swimsuit saves the day. Modcloth's swimsuits are so overpriced. Happy shopping!
