At this point unfortunately I don't even think it matters if this is gender-based or not - your boss clearly has some issue with you and it seems unlikely to just disappear on its own.

I would start getting as much in writing as possible. I know it can be hard in a small company when the atmosphere sometimes isn't so formal, but still. Have him email you with what he needs to see before you will start on that particular line of work. Keep track of that and keep proof that you have completed it.

When you have some evidence that he is being unreasonable then consider going to HR I think. Even better if one of the other colleagues is willing to speak up and admit that it seems like discrimination.
