The only gender war as far as this sub goes (which is pretty often not feminist anyway so much as in need of feminism) is the violent war on women by men, individually and systemically.

How dare you throw up your hands excusing hate just because some people's  circlejerk on a meta sub is informed by feminist viewpoints.


It's up to men to stop perpetuating their casual hate on the internet, even just when criticizing each other where we can't see it.  The negativity of PUA material and forums helped cause murder.  Misogyny is not a joke.

Let it sink in.  The guy had some messed up ideas but didn't even sound have as bad as some redditors.
