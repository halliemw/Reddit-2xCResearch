I completely agree.  I feel like subreddits like subredditdrama inevitably become the focus of trolls,  given that they point out places where users are coming together with very different opinions,  which are easy targets for people who feel the need to get a rise out of someone.  It's very unfortunate,  because I enjoy reading discussions from multiple perspectives.  I feel like it allows me to see topics from different view points,  which is something my mother tried to stress for me to do from a very young age. As a by product of the increase of trolls however,  I see posts like the one we are in now,  where users no longer feel comfortable in the places they once turned to for support and to gain a sense of community.  This makes me very sad,  both for the people that no longer feel comfortable,  as well as for the lack of perspective and knowledge that so many could have gained.
