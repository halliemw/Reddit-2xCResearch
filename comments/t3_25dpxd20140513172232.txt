NSAIDs are generally safe and well tolerated. People with major cardiovascular or gastrointestinal issues should avoid them, but that's it.  

The major side effect in healthy people is nausea, but that's usually only an issue with chronic long term use (like after a sports injury). A one time large dose like I described  shouldn't cause that.
