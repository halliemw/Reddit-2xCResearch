34F here.  I prefer the kind that keep yer boobs controlled by holding them down, not lifting them up.  I don't bother with bikinis because I keep my extra weight in my stomach area and don't feel like sucking it in all day.

With that in mind, I have a suit from Land's End that's [similar to this one](http://www.landsend.com/products/womens-leaf-grecian-one-piece-slender-suit/id_254202), which has cups sewn in but no underwire.  It also provides ass coverage.  Hooray!

These are sometimes on sale at Sears, FWIW.
