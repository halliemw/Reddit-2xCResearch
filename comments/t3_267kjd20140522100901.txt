I have been on HBC for almost 10 years now. My prescription got changed to a different brand about 2 years ago, and since then, my sex drive is all but gone. I hate it.

I would love to change my prescription, but I don't have health insurance right now and I can't afford to get an IUD (which would be great). I also don't want to straight up quit the pill because I used to get TERRIBLE hormone migraines, and I'd rather not go through that anymore. That and I really, REALLY don't want to get pregnant right now (planning a wedding, no money, renting a house, etc).

I'm also interested in people's answers.
