my understanding is that the 'period' you get when on the pill isn't a real period anyway.  It is basically from hormone withdrawal as you take a week  off from pills.  This is how it was explained by my doctor because I stopped getting it too.  She said I was one of the lucky ones.  Just take a monthly test if I'm concerned but if I'm taking my pill every day (or in my case wearing my patch every week) I really didn't need to be worried.
