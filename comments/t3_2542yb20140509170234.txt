My boyfriend was sleeping over at my place and I had just started getting the pain + cramps I always experience before getting my period but no bleeding yet. We were lying in bed, snuggling, him acting as my human heating pad and generally being very nice, when the cramps got nearly unbearable, really. I jumped up to go to the bathroom to empty my Diva Cup/generally assess if everything was still attached down there because it really hurt extremely badly. 

So, I pull out the cup, which only holds a few drops of blood and then, while squirming in pain, I feel something warm and solid fall down into my hands. A **fucking 4 inch clot of uterine lining** just fell out of my vagina. Just like that. Plop. Needless to say, I was scared pretty bad. I placed it next to the sink and thought about whom I'd rather tell, my boyfriend or my mother. 

I told both of them, and (actually not so) surprisingly, my boyfriend was lots more helpful. I informed him of the circumstances and he actually asked to see it. Yeah, why not. At that point I started to find it kind of funny. He then repeatedly reassured me that I was not gross, and after the crippling pain had completely subsided and we researched the matter a little on the internet, that I was not going to die*. He was really great. 

My mother on the other hand asked me if I planned to leave it next to the sink in an annoyed voice. 

But it was okay because my boyfriend was a wonderful ball of love and kindness and warmth. :)

^^^A ^^^few ^^^days ^^^later ^^^I ^^^went ^^^to ^^^my ^^^OBGYN ^^^and ^^^she ^^^basically ^^^told ^^^me ^^^that ^^^**it** ^^^**was** ^^^**fucking** ^^^**normal.** ^^^And ^^^the ^^^"labour-like ^^^contractions" ^^^that ^^^I ^^^experienced ^^^were, ^^^too. ^^^What ^^^the ^^^fucking ^^^fuck.

And Oh my god, I am so sorry for your loss.
