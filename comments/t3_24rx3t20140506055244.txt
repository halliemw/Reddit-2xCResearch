I don't know about that. I distinctly remember being on the internet in early 2000s and receiving one of several types of reaction:

* the internet is for men, GTFO. You're only here because you're an attention whore
* i am not really a woman, but a man is disguise
* soooo you're a girl huh? *random sexual come ons*
* you're not a real fan because you're a casual player/don't know trivia x/etc.

As a result I always went by a male nickname and went to great pains to use gender neutral language or even plain pretend to be a man. I played several RPGs and I always selected female characters because men assumed I was a man who wanted to stare at girl skimpy ass for the entire gametime. I avoided joining guilds and did my best to play solo because I couldn't stand the conversations or the resulting clusterfuck if anyone would guess I was female.
