> If you're yelling at someone and they seem to react negatively to it, why the hell would you continue.

Look, I'm not defending him yelling, but the fact is that you're not doing a good job, and you're better off having him yelling at you than passive aggressively hating you and then firing you. 

Also, no offense, if you can't take yelling or mean comments, you may not be cut out to be a lawyer.  That's basically what you have to take from opposing counsel (and clients) all the time, especially if you're in litigation.

That's another thing about being a lawyer.  There isn't time for training so you have to learn stuff as you go.  It's not fair, but that' show it goes.
