Or maybe this is just overthinking a careless remark? Can you explain how "safe" comes into this when this is a person with a record of "safeness"? I really want to know. Do the interactions that women have with men justify this level suspicion?

I let my hair grow out and then cut it every 3-4 months or so. Women I work with say things like, "I loved your long hair." I don't think their comments are sexual or out of place. In this particular instance, that seems a comparable context. I simply say, "It grows back" and let it be.

Edit: I reread the post. I feel her response was way out there.
