This really resonated with me.  He hasn't lived away from family or friends his entire life and I've moved around the country since I was 18.  He's really excited to finally start somewhere new, but is also pretty scared to be someplace where he knows no one.  I feel like I can really support him during that time since I have the experience.  

We will also be subletting a place that is not within walking distance of anything.  He'll have the only car during the day for work and I'm afraid I'll find myself sitting at home redditing, watching cartoons, and getting bitter.  

I'm okay focusing on making our apartment a nice place for him to come home to at the end of the day, but what happens when I eventually get a job?  I guess we'll cross that road when we get to it...

I guess I'm just worried that I won't be able to be emotional support all of the time when I've found my self-worth through working hard and getting paychecks on my own.
