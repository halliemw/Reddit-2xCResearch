Oh, I could whine all day.

Three weeks ago I applied for a new position at my current employer.  The assistant of the person in charge of hiring was positive I would be perfect for it, and hyped me up big time about getting the job.  I wound up not even getting an interview, and one of my supervisors made a lateral move into the position.  Figuring one door closes, another opens, I applied for her position and interviewed last Tuesday.  My boss said he would be letting all the interviewees (I believe there were 4 of us) know either way by Friday.  It's now Monday, no phone call, no email, and no company announcement yet on who is filling the position.  Whoever is being promoted is due to start on May 1, which is Thursday.  Like 4 days from now.

Through the past week I've been considering what it would be like if this week was my final week in my current position, and sort of celebrating the possibility.  Last night was one of the *shittiest* nights I've had in years, and now I'm sitting here still wondering if it's my last week or not. Last night also made me realize I don't think I can handle being in my current position much longer, I'm just too burnt out and worn out.  So I await word on this job and whether or not I should begin looking outside of my company for a new position.

None of this really compares to your shitty two weeks, but that's been mine.
