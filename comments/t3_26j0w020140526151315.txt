If men aged 18-30 are all competing for women aged 18-23 (as is supposed by many models of dating, including many in use in the real world), yes, the number of women will be smaller than the number of males.

And the 18-20 year old males will have a tougher time (I always remind guys that age that it will get better...18 year old girls are not as fond of 18-19 year old guys as they are of 22-25 year old guys, in general...reasons).

There are always exceptions, but as a man gets into his mid twenties, his prospects widen up.  

We can discuss the reasons why many men, aged 28, would prefer a 21 year old woman to a 28-30 year old woman, but a 21 year old woman may often have males aged 18-30 (and from even broader age groups) "competing" for her.  

An 18 year old male is unlikely to have women aged 18-30 competing equally for him.  His own age mates are likely to ignore him (and this is a source of angst for many a young man).  

It all evens out in our 30's and 40's, but the earlier ages may be developmentally geared toward establishing patterns of dating/sexual engagement.  

Every semester, there are at least two or three 18 year old women in a class of 100 who are dating men over 30.  46 is so far the oldest boyfriend anyone has admitted to in the past 15 years of me asking the question.  There have been, so far, no 18 year old men willing to admit they are dating a 46 year old women (and the class laughs when I make the comparison).
