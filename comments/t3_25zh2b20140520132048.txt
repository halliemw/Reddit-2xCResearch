I find this whole post alarming.  I find the dad being alone with your boyfriend alarming.  I don't know what happened to him precisely, but if it is sexual abuse as suspected I *strongly* recommend therapy and I *strongly* recommend staying away from both his parents.  'Sorry' doesn't remotely cut it.  No little boy should suffer sexual abuse. :(
