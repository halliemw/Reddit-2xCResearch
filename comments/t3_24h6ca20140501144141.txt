I'm on the pill because it's cheap and easy. I don't like the idea of keeping a patch on my skin all the time and tend to have a hard time keeping other things like bandaids stuck to me, so I don't want the hassle of dealing with a patch. Nuvaring would be an option, but at the time it wasn't covered by my insurance, so I went with a pill. I was on Tri Sprintec, the generic for OrthoTriCyclen, but it affected my moods and my period kept getting heavier for the year I was on it. Then I switched to Altavera, which is generic Nordette. It's monophasic and has basically no side effects for me, which is great. It also has 2 day periods, which are glorious and which is important for me since part of going on the pill was to address severe anemia. 

Now that I've found something that works for me, I'm hesitant to change methods. I've been considering trying the Skyla IUD, but between the part where I'm still on my parents' insurance and we don't talk about sex and the part where my gyno isn't comfortable inserting it because it's not a common form near me so I'd need to find a different doctor for the actual insertion. I mean, my doctor would refer me, but it's such a hassle that I'm just sticking with the pill for now.
