I am not exactly free from that viewpoint myself yet. But it is in many ways a lie. People can be there for each other without sacrifising themselves in a forced way and by just being natural. In my family it is all hysteria and doom. No one is free to be him/herself. I do not know your family, maybe they are nice, but they do seem to burden you somehow and that is not ok. Anyways, if you want to start working on that perhaps Alice Miller's Drama of a Gifted Child is something for you.

Edit: Also, if you are happy and energetic you are more free to help others as well.
