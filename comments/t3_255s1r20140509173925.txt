Yes, it is open to those of all beliefs, as long as you are not mean to others. Technically. However, when I voice my opinion in the one area where I'm NOT liberal (being pro-life) gets downvoted 95% of the time. So draw your own conclusions on whether or not this sub is "for" you.

If you decide to stick around-- welcome! It's always nice to see Christians on reddit. Sometimes I feel like the only one!
