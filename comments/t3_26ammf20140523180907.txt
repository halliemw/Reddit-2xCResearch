You are correct. If he is suppose to be under supervision and he isn't then that is completely unacceptable. It's a danger to him and everyone around him. I also read the story as she was training to be a teacher for the DD students. So definitely go find someone who is supposed to be working with them, after making it clear that it's not acceptable to touch someone in that matter. That behavior has to be corrected immediately. Period. And if he continues then unfortunately police may be involved.
