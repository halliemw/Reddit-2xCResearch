I meant that I wanted advice from women because living in the UK the NHS is very pro contraception and tend to be quite pushy in that respect, so I wanted a more realistic view of the side effects. I'm saying this because the current pill I'm on has side effects that are documented online, but were never brought to my attention when I was put on the pill to begin with. Thanks for the advice about xxfitness, I'd considered posting there, it's where I heard about the moving tampons! And I started in Nov and am up to 60kg at the moment, so do expect to be at 90kg (200lbs) at somepoint in the upcoming future (at least whilst I still have the IUD fitted), I will have to ask my doctor about that. I'm not concerned about it falling out, just I know the exercise is quite straining on the whole body and therefore if it was going to be a problem I'd look for an alternative contraception. Thanks for your advice :)
