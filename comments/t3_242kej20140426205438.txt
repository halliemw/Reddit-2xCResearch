You have to make yourself busy, no one is going to do it for you. It's definitely not the easy thing, the easy thing is to sit and watch TV or go on reddit. Those are fine in moderation, but looking back at your day wouldn't you like to go to sleep knowing you've accomplished something or spent time with people you care about (not necessarily a significant other)?

I'm in a relationship but my boyfriend and I are both very busy people. During the week we basically catch up in the car when picking each other up, and spend dinner together. The rest of the time is our own time. My activities after work during the week include making jewelry in a local studio and working out at the gym. That leaves me just enough time to cook dinner when it's my turn, play with the cat, clean up the house occasionally during the week, sometimes watch an episode of a tv show.

On Fridays we meet up with friends at a local pub after work to talk about our weeks and make weekend plans if possible. These plans usually include poker, hiking, canoeing, camping, target shooting, movie night, or whatever cool event is happening in town that weekend. It took me a while to find friends I really enjoy hanging out with (it's much more difficult than the college days), you have to stick your neck out there and network to find like-minded people. They're out there, and they will do fun stuff with you!

Best of luck finding yourself OP, become an interesting person through hard work and you will draw people to you. :)
