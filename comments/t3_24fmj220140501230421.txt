I'm getting a psych degree, but I'm going to have a French minor and a religious studies minor. I mean, I've gotten close to a 4.0, but luckily my classes have been pretty easy...I don't think they're necessarily easy, but my professors have been organized, which makes it better for me! Relaxing and socializing sounds nice, but I'm also an RA, so when I have free time I don't really have free time :P It also helps that I talk and get to know my professors because they're willing to help me out when I need a few extra points. Also, the classes I take are extremely interesting and my professors have all been engaging!

Thank you! I usually take about 15-17 credits! My lowest will be next semester with 14.
