Maybe you can plant a tree with your girls this spring. It would be nice to leave them some videos and/or letters. This might sound really weird, but consider making your Facebook page fairly public so they can have access to your posts and pictures when they get older to have a Facebook account. Also, if you have the time/money, maybe you can all take a nice vacation together and spend good, quality time with one another.

As for your wife, Jesus, I just don't know what to say. I'm trying to put myself in that situation (my husband and I have two kids, a boy and a girl, as well). Emotionally, I just can't even make myself do it. Tell her how you know she will mourn and struggle, but what you want for her is to find happiness again. Tell her she never needs to feel bad about not being a perfect parent or smiling again or laughing again or even loving again. Tell her you don't want her to feel guilty when she is able to be happy and laugh. You want her to eventually be able to smile at memories of you and be able to fondly think back on all ofyour wonderful memories together. Most importantly, just hold her a lot. I bet there will be some night when she comes out of her shell and wants to talk about it or at least cry to you about it while she can.

I'm so sorry for you and your family. I'm really glad your kids are old enough where they got to know you, love you, and remember you.
