Yeah I was on a generic form of Seasonale for about 5 years. The change was slow, but toward the end I was having really bad issues with anxiety, and just felt low all the time. Went ahead and stopped it, and felt so much better, like I was me again. For me at least, my cycle became regular right away so I didn't have any adjusting period. Also turned out, I probably should have never been on it to begin with, I have aura migraines, and that particular doctor didn't see that as an issue.
