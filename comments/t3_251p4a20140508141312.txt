This is what you will be dealing with from now on unfortunately.  In every single thread that a woman posts here there will be comments like this.  In the name of "discussion" you will be bombarded with shit like this about telling rape victims what they could have done and how they deserved it.

The whole post is just a way to blame women for the actions of others while falsely promoting the idea that dissenting opinions are somehow always good no matter how uninformed, stupid, or just plain hurtful they may be.
