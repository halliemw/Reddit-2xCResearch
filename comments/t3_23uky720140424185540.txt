Yeah - for the past few months I've been using these tactics to preserve my sanity. I don't plan to hang out with her alone if I can help it so that when she bails I'm not totally ditched; we've pulled the pretend-event-starts-an-hour-earlier thing once when we really had to (I don't like the dishonesty/treating her like a child but it worked and we would've apparently been an hour late otherwise); etc. Thing is she has no shame, and what happens is the group makes plans, she's invited so if she shows up it's a bonus, and because it's relaxed there's no consequence when she shows up really late because we're just all here hanging out not depending on her anyway. So yeah like you said - forgiving friends etc. 

You are SPOT on with the lax parents and dating people who put up with their shit!
