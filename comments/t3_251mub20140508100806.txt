It's nice to see a benefit of being defaulted! You've probably met hundreds of feminists in your life without knowing it! You *will* get a lot of different definitions on feminism from different people.


To me feminism is the idea that women are equal to men. That's basically it.


To me this also includes transwomen and transmen and LBQTA and everything in between. For a small example, I believe boys should be able to play with pink dolls without harassment and girls should be able to play with blue trucks. I believe a transwoman has the right to use the woman's room. I believe men and women are still not paid or treated equally in the work place. I believe we need a better parental leave for both parents. I believe we need more rape prevention and resources for men and women.


Feminism to some people also means rejecting beauty roles. This is where you get some feminists who don't shave their legs or armpits. To me feminism is the right to chose, so a feminist who has red lipstick on and wearing a dress is as valid as a feminist with 3 inches of leg hair. And hey, I've been both. 


Another issue that comes up is if it's un-feminist to want to work in the home. Again, I think it's a personal choice and both decisions are valid.


Some people do have other qualms about feminism. They don't think that black women or women of color are equality represented in the movement. Frankly, I don't know enough about this to make a stand either way.  Black women do face harsher discrimination than white women, and the 'picture' of feminism is usually a white woman, but like I said, I really don't know enough to make a stand.
