I do understand. Even though my mom wasn't diagnosed until I was about 19, I felt like she stopped really being my mom once I hit high school. My dad is also sick so she was very stressed with that and with my younger brothers, so I kind of stepped up and took care of myself. I'm really sorry to hear about your mom and your situation. Many people just don't get it. I hope you have a couple people who do understand and who support you. I also hope that you don't have the burden of caretaking. It's just so much for anyone, let alone someone so young.  

My mom smiled at me today, so there's that. I hope your Mother's Day went well too!
