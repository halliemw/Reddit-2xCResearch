>So what would you do with all those super cute, gently used, name brand panties laying around?

Cleaning rags. If they're full-coverage you have enough cloth to make that work.

I can get underwear for cheap. It doesn't seem worth the risk (minimal though it is), visceral unpleasantness, or cost of shipping to buy used underwear.
