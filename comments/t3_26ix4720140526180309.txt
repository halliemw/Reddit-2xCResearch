I just ended a relationship with a man exactly like that and it was the best thing I ever did. I'm happy now and I'm free of his burden. When you're with someone like that it's exhausting. Since you're a married woman, stop what you're doing. You don't want to be labeled a cheat. If you like this guy so much, then I think you have your answer. Even when things are going south, when you truly love someone, you don't stray.
