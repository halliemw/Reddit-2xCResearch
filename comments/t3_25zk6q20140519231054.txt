I agree. I wish that gals, or any word, really, could work that way when talking about women, but I don't know of any. So, I just try to call all "females" women. 

I identify as a feminist, amd I try to use language about women very carefully, and even I have a hard time with it. I did porn for several years, and to this day I refer to the women that I worked with in that industry as girls, when I'm not thinking about it (I'm "female", btw). Obviously, all of the women in the industy were at least 18, and I still struggle with calling them women. It's so weird to me that I do that. I honestly think it speaks to a societal problem that we have with women, that I honestly don't know how to adress in a meaningful way.
