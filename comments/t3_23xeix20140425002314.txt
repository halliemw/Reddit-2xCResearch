Foreplay, foreplay, foreplay. Also, oral for both of you - if both parts are slippery, it'll happen easier. Lube too.

I have a similar problem, I'm pretty small-framed and my boyfriend's, well 6'8" and... um, very proportional. We definitely struggled with sex at first (fingers too!) and it took us a while to figure out a method that wouldn't leave me in pain. Lube helped at first, but I really hated how slimy it felt. Lots and lots of foreplay, slobbery oral and starting off slowly (girl on top works better because you can control the entry).

And meh, it's not a dumb problem. I'm sure lots of women have similar issues.
