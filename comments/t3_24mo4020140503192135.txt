I know you obviously love your mum but I have to be blunt. When she told you 'that's just the way he is and to move on', she might as well just told you to shut the fuck up and forget about it. She's asking you to accept the abuse and deal with it. She's an enabler unfortunately.  Looking that term up which make you more aware of abusive dynamics. 

You have to put your safety and emotional wellbeing first before 'the perfect family'. I'm one of these people who believes that parents should protect their children and your mother is not. Even the part where she says she is lonely, is a manipulation whether she intends it to be or not., because you feel sympathy for her and are compelled to stay beyond all reasonable instincts which are telling you this isn't right. 

My mother left me alone with my drunken father while she hid in her room. Although I can understand why because she didn't want to get beat, I don't find it to be OK that it happened. she said the same things but I am heavily scarred by those experiences which I should never have had to experience. No one deserves that. 

All I'm saying you can love and care for your mother but it shouldn't come at the cost of your physical and emotional wellbeing.
