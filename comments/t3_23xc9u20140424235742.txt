Keep doing what you're doing and ignore your family. You, at the very least, understand what is healthy and normal for you. It's sad that they would justify their bad habits by claiming it's normal, but people with addictions tend to do that, and I don't doubt they have some kind of addiction with food. 

Congrats on the weight loss.
