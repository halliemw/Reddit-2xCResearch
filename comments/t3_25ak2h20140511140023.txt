Be strategic about this. If it's about not having him jerk around your daughter, it sounds like you can achieve that by not putting in any effort for her to spend time with him. 

Think about what his relinquishing affects: It sounds like he'd pretty much disappear from your life if he didn't feel some legal obligation. No future option for child support. Someone might be her adoptive dad some day, but it doesn't sound like that's pressing now. Parental rights affects medical visitation and decisions in the event of illness or emergency. Parental rights also affect who has custody in the event something bad happens to you.

I guess my point is that if you want to change the amount of contact your daughter has with her bio-dad, you probably have some leeway without a legal change. So make sure what you do with regard to parental rights makes sense for other reasons. (Also, if his parents are in the picture, I have no idea how your state/country regards the rights of grandparents, but they may or may not change based on whether he is legally her parent.)
