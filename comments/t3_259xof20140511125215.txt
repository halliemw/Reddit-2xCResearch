I have had similar problems at times. I like a lot of solitary hobbies, like art and writing. I joined a writer's group for a while, and that was fun, though I didn't form close bonds with the other ladies. They too were more focused on family/children than I am, and most of them wrote romance. I write horror. Still, they welcomed me and it was fun. 
I go out all the time, my husband is in a band, and I like to dance. I dance with strangers and friends. I dance in places where you can't hear what anyone is saying anyway. People are drinking too. I have a lot of fun and am genuinely happy to see all of these people and dance with anyone at all. I don't get super close to many people and it is partly because that's how I want it. I have one very close friend who lives a couple of hours away. I think I'm still working on the ability to be close to more people. I'm middle aged BTW, and this isn't a bad way to live, just have to find ways to combat loneliness. One thing that helped me a lot was getting a dog. I can't be lonely when he needs me to do things with him every day.
