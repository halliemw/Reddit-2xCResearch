Mentally handicapped or not, you can't have someone just out in public who is going around groping people at will.  Unacceptable.  Do whatever you have to do, but make sure people know he's doing this.  If he's done it to you, he's probably done it to others and will continue to do it.

Even if it's putting up a "Hey this guy touches lady crotches" sign, they should take care of this somehow.
