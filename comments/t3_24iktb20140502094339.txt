This will be my 14th year on the playa, the Home began in 2005.  I'd had gift racks before, those were fun, but not fulfilling.  I paint miniatures for dollhouses and wanted to display them, but realized people would want them.    Put the two ideas together, and the Home was born.  I paint, beg for donated art, gather bad art and found art, and recycled art.  I am not a very good artist, but prolific. I also have added a Gifting Box, for the things which don't really fit onto/with the Home.  

Yes, it is a true giveaway. People can adopt and keep any piece of art, they only have to fill out a small card.  I accept donations of art, supplies, and such, but never money.  In nine years, I have only sold one painting (off playa of course).  Last few years, we top giving away over 500 pieces of art.

See the trailer?  Yes, that is how we haul the Home and our camp. The chicken wire rolls up, and the two panels fit into the top of the trailer.  The little table disassembles.  I have four or five plastic bins which hold the art.  I also have a couple easels.  I am almost always in Hushville, and very easy to find.
