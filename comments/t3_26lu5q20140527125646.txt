>I run, I eat fruit and veg and I drink alot of water

Then it sounds like you're living a very healthy lifestyle, and there's no reason to change anything about your diet unless you want to.

>I'm always going to be a bit chubby, have armpit fat and a lack of a thigh gap

That's because everyone has a different body shape. I have a "thigh gap" because I have a very hourglass figure, and have hips that are very wide-set. I would probably still have a gap between my thighs if I was overweight. Conversely, someone with a smaller pelvis/less wide-set hips might not have a gap between her thighs even if she was extremely skinny. "Thigh gap" is most definitely not any kind of measure of health or attractiveness.

I've seen so many female friends really wreck their lives by getting extremely hung up on trying to have a certain body size or shape that is not natural for them. By "wreck" I mean things ranging from "getting so incredibly obsessed with dieting and the gym that they had time for nothing else, including friends, their SO, or devoting proper attention to work or school" to "developing an eating disorder". I have to say that I've really never seen anything good come of people acting on a desire to have a specific body type.

Continue your healthy habits, eat what you like, and enjoy your life!
