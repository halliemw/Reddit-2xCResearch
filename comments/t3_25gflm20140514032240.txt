Correct. That is what my point entailed. Nor can you use the laws of physics to dismiss, in this way, environmental factors beyond a person's control (my point also entailed this).

I directly expand one of the common responses from people the parent commenter mentions in order to more fully address the prejudices we find against fat people. Something central to the frustrations expressed by the character in the Original Video.

In order to overcome prejudices they must be identified and contested.

You could well argue that "well lose some weight and stop being so gross and fat!" depends on other more basic views, different from the one's I mention. But whether I am right or wrong about which views are more basic, I have no idea how you could regard this as irrelevant.

You could hold the corollaries I mention to be true in which case I'd ask for the evidence to demonstrate your holding of it does not count as prejudice. Regardless of whether such a person was succesfull at this, I have no idea how you could regard my assertions that "well lose some weight and stop being so gross and fat!" does depend on other corollaries (comprising of other proposition about being fat), as irrelevant.

Edit: Last two paragraphs for clarity.
