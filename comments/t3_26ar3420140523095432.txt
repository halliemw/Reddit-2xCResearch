Is my husband right? Yes and no. His concerns are valid but maybe he didn't articulate that in the best way.

Is it worth it? I agree that it's your body and your choice and if you want a tattoo it's ultimately your decision in the end. However your approach to having an open mind to his opposition may need some re-evaluating.

>I don't want to be dismissive about his concerns

And then the next breath

>To be perfectly honest, I don't give two shits whether or not he's personally bothered by my idea to add another tattoo to my body.
