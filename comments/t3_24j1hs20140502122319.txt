Thank you so much!
During the street festival, many community members and companies set up booths to provide passersby with free food. My booth provided hot tea, refreshing rose milk, and some ethnic and Canadian snacks (think granola bars and ring pops. Haha!).  

Everyone is invited, regardless of their religion, culture or ethnicity. It is an important time to look beyond people's exterior and just be in unity with one another. This is why I took part in volunteering my time to do this.
