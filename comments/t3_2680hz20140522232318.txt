As a lady I would find it hard to be friends with someone I was initially physically attracted to who, I asked out, and then that person turns my down. I would be 1. humiliated and 2. unable to separate my attraction to be friends with them. I don't understand why you are expecting so many people to be able to do this. That being said, being turned down doesn't give anyone the right to be a creepy fuckwad and send gross texts.
