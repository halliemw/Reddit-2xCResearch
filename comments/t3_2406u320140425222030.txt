It's not impossible to get pregnant 4 days after your period. In fact, that's getting close to prime time.

Day 1 of your period is day 1 of your cycle. Let's say your period lasts 5 days. You had sex 4 days after that, so that would be day 9 of your cycle. Sperm can live in you for up to 5-7 days. So, you could have had sperm in you from day 9 through day 16 of your cycle. Most women ovulate around day 14, give or take a couple of days... so, it's certainly possible you ovulated while there was still sperm present.

You won't be able to take an accurate pregnancy test until close to your expected period date, almost two weeks from now.
