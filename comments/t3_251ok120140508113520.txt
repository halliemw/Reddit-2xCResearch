If I wanted to educate men on all this stuff I could literally go anywhere else on reddit, save a handful of subs. Eff that. I came here to talk with other women, not have to tell some jerk for the 15th time why catcalls are not 'just compliments' and that I am NOT obligated to dress/smile/talk just to please them.
