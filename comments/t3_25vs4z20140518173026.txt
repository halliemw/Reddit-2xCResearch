One other thing I did experience in my healing process.. there will be moments in which there will be a part of you waiting for SOMETHING to happen... that will pass... it sometimes happens to me still, only because I never know when my ex, well, more so his wife,with her mental condition when she'll act up. 

But she doesn't act up anymore because after 15 years the former drama that would ensure and she'd laugh about, is now like "Really XXX this shit again? Whatever.  We're all too old for this shit except for you."
