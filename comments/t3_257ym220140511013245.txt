Like a lot of people have been saying, your relationship with the person is key. In general, if you're not in or pursuing a romantic relationship with that person, it can get pretty weird when you call her "cute" or "hot," whatever the context. Really, even in a "pursuing" context, it can come across as creepy if she's not interested.
