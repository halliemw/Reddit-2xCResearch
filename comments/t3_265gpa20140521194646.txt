When I took an internship, I tried to find housing not in dorms, but in private housing off campus. If you look up sublets on craigslist, often there are students who have year long leases and are desperate to have someone paying some kind of rent over the summer while they go home. You should see if that's an option. 

In any case, ask for a Skype interview. You can even create a throwaway account on Skype for this. Ask for a tour of the place beforehand via your webcam (However, there's always the possibility that they're not giving you a tour of the actual place you'll be staying at). 

But really, the best thing to do is to find someone you trust to check out the place for you. I had to find housing in a city that I had never been in, so I asked a distant friend about the housing complex that I was considering. She said it was fine. This year, I had a family friend drive by the house to make sure it matched up with what I saw on Skype. 

Another thing: make sure you're familiar with the schedules of the buses and make sure that they're running at all times of the day/night. You might go somewhere in the afternoon and come home late at night--it's best to know that you won't have to be walking home alone, late. Ask specifically how close the place is to a bus stop.
