Not sure how to break this to you, but you aren't, in fact, a person whose opinion on what "the female experience" or "everyday girl stuff" should actually be matters. You don't get to decide what's "diverse" enough for the representation of women.

Seriously, there are two posts about uterus-things on the front page and you flip out and think we're all being massive stereotypes? What? That only makes sense if a) you think that 2 data points are enough to do anything with, and b) if you see a woman-friendly space as something that should try to introduce female-ness to a male space by...not talking about some aspects of being a woman...because men will think it's too stereotypical...and that's something we should care about?

P.S., "sex-related" is a weird word to use, since menstruation has almost 0 things to do with sex, and abortion is only related to sex in that sex is usually a prerequisite. So the fact that your immediate frame of reference for what happens with a woman's body is "sex" is kind of troubling. You might wanna get that looked at.
