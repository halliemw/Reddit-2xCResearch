I posted this elsewhere in the thread but I also wanted to add that many women of color don't get to decide to use the word "slut" as an empowering word because they are deemed wanton/freaky/exotic/slutty by default in society without having their own say so, so it's hard to "take back" a word that has been foisted upon you because of your race and gender.
