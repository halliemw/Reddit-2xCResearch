It's not about being afraid of these people, it's the dehumanizing feeling of being treated as a sexual object by complete strangers who, as /u/SENKI points out, are highly unlikely to be interested in getting to know you as a person.

For example, I live in the Middle East (I'm a white North American). I get cat-called, honked at, whistled at, and leered at every day, no matter where I go, no matter what I'm wearing. I get cat-called when I'm out for a run in (long) shorts and a t-shirt; when I'm walking to work in slacks and a cardigan (despite the 30C heat); in the winter when I'm wearing a motherfucking knee-length wool peacoat and a wool hat.

These men do not want to start a conversation with me and eventually get married and live happily ever after, the way your mother and father did. They don't think my socks are cute. They see me, as a woman, as existing for their sexual gratification. They consider my body in a public space theirs to objectify and make proclamations about. They consider me not a full person, and therefore not worthy of treating with the respect they would afford a man (and by "they" I mean specifically the cat-callers, not *all* men in the country I live in, obviously).  

It is exhausting and soul-crushing to *constantly* deal with this, and since I don't speak the language well enough, I can't even have the satisfaction of telling them off. It's not a compliment. I have great self esteem, so I don't need unsolicited validation from creepy strangers, thanks. 

Dudes doing this in North America are doing it for the exact same reasons. I'm sure nobody consciously think to themselves, "oh a pretty girl, Imma objectify her!" but if they're yelling shit at girls because they're daring to appear in public in a tank top, then guess what? They aren't treating her with the same respect they would a man - they're classifying women as lower on the totem pole, and deserving of harassment based on what she's wearing.
