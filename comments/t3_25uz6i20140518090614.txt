Without giving a hard sell, you might consider reading up on Tantric sex. A lot of it is pretty woo, but it's good to know about. Rather than just accepting the vigorous male thrusting (which is no more than replication of male masturbation technique) you will be in a unique position to develop a more loving and considerate sexual style right out of the gate. P.S. I have a penis.
