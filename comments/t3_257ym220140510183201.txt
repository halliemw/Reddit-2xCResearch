I went to a SIGGRAPH convention (I was an engineer on our project) to talk about our new 3D engine.  A guy asked me in casual conversation, "How's the marketing going?".  I replied, "Hell if I know, I'm an engineer." and I showed him my tag.  He was quite embarrassed, I think if he could will the floor to open and swallow him up, he'd have been happier.
