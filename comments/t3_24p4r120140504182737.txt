It was a gradual reduction. I initially cut out white sugar, white bread, regular potatoes, semolina pastas, and replaced all of that with raw sugar, whole grain breads/pastas and sweet potatoes. Now, I only do one meal a day incorporating a carb (usually a slow carb), and only have regular bread/pasta on rare occasion.

The koji soap works, but it take a while. I went through an entire bar before I started to notice a marked difference. Amazon sells it in a two pack for like 6 or 7 bucks, I believe.
