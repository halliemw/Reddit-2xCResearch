The before picture here is just what people look like.  No one's going to dog you for looking like a person.  People never scope armpits.  I vote give your pits a light shave and then do the YMCA at the beach.  Zero people will notice and care.  Let it go.

Tweezing armpit hair sounds like the worst thing in the world.  I am so sorry that was ever a part of your life.
