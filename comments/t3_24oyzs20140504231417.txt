I think a lot of people incorrectly assume that family oriented = submissive. I have a lot of friends with Asian Moms. Most of these moms will clean, cook and even give up their jobs to raise the family. Yet a cold day would pass in hell before any of these women acted submissive. They were definitely Tiger Moms who weren't afraid to chew out their husbands for staying out too late, or whoop some butt if you didn't do your homework. Not submissive at all.
