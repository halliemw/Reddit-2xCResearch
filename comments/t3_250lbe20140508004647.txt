I'm just going to say this. You would be *amazed* at how few people really notice your hair. I am similar to you and have bought a range of wigs for when I want to go out and have fun and not worry about what I'm going to look like in photos (the thing I hate most about having thin hair). And the number of people *that I know well* who will compliment me on my "new haircut" is truly astonishing!
