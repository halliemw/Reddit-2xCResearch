I really appreciate your reply. The day went okay - he was scheduled to work but only stayed a little while and came back home. We mostly did homework, stayed a little hermit-y, and all that. I shared with him your perspective with everyone wanting something from YOU, wanting a performance. I think that resonated with him, and I hope that it's clear that while I can't control others, I won't expect anything like that from him. All I want is to create a place for him where he can be and act however he wants to in the way that's most healing for him. Thanks to your perspective I think I have a better understanding of how to do that.
