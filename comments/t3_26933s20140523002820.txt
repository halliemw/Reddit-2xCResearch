What I've come to realize is that toxic people are toxic people. They will strike out at obvious targets--like women--that they feel they can get away with it. But the thing is, it demoralizes everyone trying to be professional. 

Just because it's a bunch of guys on a team doesn't mean every guy is comfortable with porn at work. And you can drive the women out of the situation, but the guys just turn on each other eventually. 

At my last job, I got ignored a lot, but learned how to work back channels with guys who wanted to get things done. Eventually I proved myself to the group, but I saw them turn their unprofessional attentions on men. 

It caused needless drama and missed deadlines. It was horrible when it truly didn't need to be.
