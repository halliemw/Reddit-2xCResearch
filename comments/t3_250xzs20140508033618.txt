I think only you can decide that.  You have to look at your relationship and how he and you have been before last night.  

Like others on here, my short answer is to leave this guy.  But, some folks, when not drinking, are great people.   

Is it realistic that he can go the rest of his life without drinking?  If you do drink together, is this possibly going to happen again?
