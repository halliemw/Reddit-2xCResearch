I babysat an adopted kid once. His mothers celebrated his birthday and his adoption day, which I always thought it was awesome attitude towards it. It makes it something to celebrate & be happy about, not to ignore and feel ashamed about. "This is the day you came into the world." "This is the day we became family."
