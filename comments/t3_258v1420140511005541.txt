I was wearing a sports bra one day and my 25 yo boyfriend called it a "push-up bra." I was confused for a minute and asked him to explain. Basically he thought it was called a push up bra because you do push ups in them! So then I gave him a brief lesson on the different types of bras.

Also, my dad didn't know and never had seen a tampon until he married my mom in 1988 at the age of 30
