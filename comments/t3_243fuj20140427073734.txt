Fake it until you make it? Practice makes perfect? I honestly don't know.

I started masturbating at a very young age, like 8 or 9. So all the guilt and self conscious stuff never really got into the equation because I was too young to realize what I was doing and that it was sexual in nature. It was just fun! 

By the time I learned about sex and how stifled discussion is on female sexuality, I was so comfortable getting to orgasm that it was too late to have any effect on my habits. For about a week I wondered "Is this wrong? Am I being slutty?", but then quickly those ideas were gone and I was back at it.

I wish every girl could discover masturbation like I did. By myself with no pressure, but, that ain't gonna happen. Just know you are normal and the only judgement that really matters, is your own.

BTW Feel free to ask any questions. I *have* been masturbating almost 20 years now
