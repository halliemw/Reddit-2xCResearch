I use a metal version/style of drain catcher, in your local hardware store.  I also use a drain snake when needed.  But you have to keep in mind when using these you can not use the drain plug, unable to fill the tub.  You would have to use a rubber stopper.  Because I also have one in the bathroom sink, I wear hard contacts ($700).  Believe me you only have to pay a plumber $100 on a Friday night, once, to figure that out :)
