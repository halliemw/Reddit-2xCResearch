An IUD is about as slightly more effective as a tubal ligation. According to Planned Parenthood, tubal ligation is about 99.5% effective. Additionally, if a woman was to get pregnant after a tubal ligation, there is about a 1 in 3 chance it will be a dangerous (and sometimes life threatening) ectopic pregnancy. An IUD is about as effective, doesn't come with the ectopic pregnancy risk, doesn't come with all of the procedural risks, and is effective for years. If I was a doctor, I think I would also recommend a woman go for the less risky and just as effective procedure. While not permanent, an IUD lasts five years. Wouldn't a doctor be pretty irresponsible to do the other, riskier procedure unless there was a good reason for it?
