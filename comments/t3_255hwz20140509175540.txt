opiate addiction is usually started by being prescribed medications for a completely valid reason, and it evolves from there. In many cases, it is absolutely not a choice. The thing that is so sad about this addiction is that it can affect anybody, people who are considered intelligent and that you would never expect. Addiction is not rational at all. I wish more people realized this. I think more people would seek help, but they don't because they feel so judged by people who make them feel like it is their fault and a choice they make.
