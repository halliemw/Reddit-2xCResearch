Choking is an extremely serious form of domestic violence. Your mom has to get out of the relationship as soon as possible. A domestic violence agency in her town can help her get to a safe place or can help her begin the process of leaving. She needs to leave now when the escalation is new and fresh, and before this too becomes just another part of life for her. 

Your dad could use some (more) therapy and some AA. However, he won't do either until he loses everything. Also, you can't force anyone into a detox clinic. The doors are not locked there. He can check himself in, and he can check himself out.

Unfortunately, OP, you don't really have any control over any of this. You have the ability to call the cops when arguments turn illegal- and that depends on the state you live in. You can tell your parents that you love them but this is unacceptable behavior. But that doesn't mean that they will change. You have the ability to be there for your brother and your sister and provide a safe place for them to come to when your mom and dad's dynamic is too much for them. And you have the ability to get a bit of therapy or self-help yourself and make sure that the cycle of violence and alcoholism is broken with you. Al-anon is a very good resource for adult children of alcoholics.
