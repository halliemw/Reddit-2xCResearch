I work downtown in a big city with a big homeless problem. I get asked for money from all kinds of guys (some I'm not even sure are homeless..??). I usually just say "Sorry, no cash." It acknowledges them as a person speaking to me and also politely says "I'm not giving you money." I guess once homeless dudes start carrying iphones with the square app and can take credit cards, I'll have to think of a new line.
