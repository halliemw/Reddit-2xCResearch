I disagree. If the perp does not see the consequences of his actions, he will escalate in the future. Turning a blind eye to acts such as this is enabling, and enabling is a real problem.

If the perp did not have enablers in the first place, he would not have been able to take or distribute the photo. There will always be that 2% of disgusting people, but we can discourage their behavior by reporting and refusing to participate in their behavior.
