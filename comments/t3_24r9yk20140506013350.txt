I'm not sure I understand the question? 

Basically last night I went out with girlfriends, got wasted and he double checked before we had sex. He's a good man and TwoX is full of stories of not good men. Rightfully so too, women need to know how to help themselves and each other when faced with a difficult situation. 

I just thought I'd offer a little hope for the XX who are single and wondering if it's possible to be happily married. It is.
