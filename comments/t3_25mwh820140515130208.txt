Riding my bike to work one day, I randomly heard "I WANNA LICK THAT PUSSY!"  I was going down a short steep hill, which made it too awkward to stop quickly, so when I got to the bottom, I turned around to see where it came from - some guy in an SUV parked beside a house. I stared at him for a few seconds and threw up my hands, yelling "REALLY. WHAT THE FUCK?!?!"   He made a motion with his hands like "What? Me? I didn't..."  In retrospect, I kind of wish I'd just walked back up to ask him why he'd say something like that to me (I didn't feel physically threatened, just very annoyed). I'm 31, but I do look like a teenager. Regardless of my age, it was still an extremely inappropriate thing to say.
