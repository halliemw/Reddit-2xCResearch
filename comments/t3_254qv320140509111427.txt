I see your point, but I disagree with it being an ungendered issue. Yeah, men can be trafficked too, but if we're talking about human sex trafficking (which we are), it's clearly skewed towards men being most of the perpetrators and women being most of the traffickers. It's in the same vein as rape culture: it definitely affects *everyone*, but it is deeply rooted in sexism. These women are being bought as wives, and many more women are being used for prostitution.
