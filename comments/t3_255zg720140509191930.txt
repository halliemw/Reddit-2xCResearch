Damn. Some good ideas here.  Now *I* have to set one up.  And I've been putting that off lol.  She has said that I should do it, and I kept coming up with excuses (what does counseling matter if I'm dying).

I think you also are right with the bank account passwords and stuff.  While we did the will and stuff and the beginning, we then have focused on me going through treatment, and have kinda left the details of death alone. It would probably be a really good thing to sit down and figure this stuff out, and would help the both of us deal with that. 

Some really good advice here!  Thanks!
