Yep. I was so thankful that my college taught me how to properly observe and record. When I went to administration, I was told that it's all about perception. I told them that I took a class on perception and this wasn't it. I had my mini notebook full of neutral records and a signature of someone who was there and witnessed what I witnessed. So I got stuffed away instead of dealing with the exprincipal now teacher.
