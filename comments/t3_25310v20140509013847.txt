Is it mandatory? If yes, then it's wrong. If not, who cares? 

Is makeup not something that (I know not all) at least a solid majority of women have some interest in? The company, decided to do something extra for it's employees while at the same time acknowledging they are, in fact, women. 

That being said, if it is a mandatory thing...well that's just fucked up on a few levels. The most obvious of which is the company is saying the ladies in your dept just aren't that good looking.
