ok i agree with this. but lets also keep in mind that at that age boys are developmentally 2-3 years behind girls. so if you are going to hold the correct context you should think of it like a 6 year old girl and a 10-11 year old girl. 

this is the reason that parents have to worry about teenage boys doing dumb things. at the magical age of 13-15 boys are bigger and stronger and a whole lot dumber than girls their own age. that is why young girls go for boys a few years older then them, and that is also why the parents don't trust the boys and try to protect the girls. its not that the boys are evil, its that the are both dumb and strong. 

edit: boys don't catch up to girls completely until around age 23. but at age 16 for boys, 14 for girls, they can be expected to have a strong enough sense of empathy to make adult decisions, because of some important brain and cognitive development.
