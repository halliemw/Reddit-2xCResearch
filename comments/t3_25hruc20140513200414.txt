After several disastrous relationships and close to just giving up I met the love of my life at 32. He was a few years older, divorced with 2 teenagers, not what I thought I was looking for at all. But for me he was/is perfect. We dated 3 months, got engaged, were married 6 months later, and have been together 12 years now. I wouldn't change anything. I loved, loved, loved my 30s! So much better than my 20s. Please do not give up! Things get so much better!
