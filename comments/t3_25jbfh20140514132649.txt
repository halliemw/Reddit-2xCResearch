Like I said I realise its only a small problem. It doesn't even bother me that much, just sometimes it sticks out and bugs me.

And yes, I am incredibly lucky about my job. I love my job to bits, I really do. It's very stressful sometimes but who's job isn't? And like you say if this is the worst complaint I have, things are pretty good!
