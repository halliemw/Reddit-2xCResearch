I think it's interesting that women with wide hips have more sex than others, but I think their hypothesis to explain why is just crazy. They think it's because those women "subconsciously know" that childbirth won't be as risky, so they don't hold back. What? 

I think more research needs to be done, but shouldn't they be examining other ideas, like what makes some women's hips wider? Is it genetics, or is it hormones during puberty? Are those women more fertile? Do women with wider hips tend to be, well, hornier than average? 

When I was pregnant, my OB-Gyn told me the hips from the outside aren't a good predictor for how wide the pelvis is inside. So, this explanation about wide-hipped women subconsciously knowing childbirth will be less risky for them just seems really sub-par.
