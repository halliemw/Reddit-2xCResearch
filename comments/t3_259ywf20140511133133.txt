A save the date card I would forgive. I would consider it rude and tactless, as they've indicated that I was invited and asked me to "reserve" that date for them. But I would forgive it, as you're right, budgets and plans do change.

But if someone invited me to a shower and not the wedding? God no. That's appalling. Completely selfish. The entire purpose of a shower is to "shower" the bride with gifts in preparation for her married life. Frankly, I don't like them to start with. An entire party dedicated to buying you presents? If you want to celebrate your wedding, arrange a luncheon with friends. Not a "shower" aimed at giving you gifts. If I were invited to a shower but not the wedding, with not even a phone call to explain why, I would assume the bride was a rude, ignorant boor only interested in presents. Probably the sort of bride who believes your wedding gift should cover the cost of your "plate" at the wedding.
