There's no easy way to do it, in my opinion. It will always be awkward and uncomfortable. But you could just ask to go over and speak to him, or meet up (though the public thing is always more weird for me), and tell him that he's a great guy but you just don't see this going anywhere and it's best to end things now, rater than waste your time or his.
