These are super cool! Nice work. The OoT hookshot is my fav.

I dunno if you've heard of [Awesome Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/), but they do speed running games for charity. They often have prizes for different tiers of donations. (I've seen them have the Wind Waker itself, and some other things.) Contacting them about providing a prize might be a good way to get the word out about your company to a larger amount of people!
