the placebo pills are all equivalent, technically you don't have to take them at all, they're just to keep you in the habit of taking a pill every day. It would be a problem if you were taking them in columns instead of rows, but taking the placebo pill for Sunday on a placebo Monday day will be just fine.

Plan B can potentially drive your hormones batty, just a heads up. Be nice to yourself and breathe a bit!
