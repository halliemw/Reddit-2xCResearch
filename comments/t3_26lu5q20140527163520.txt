You are not *always* going to be "a bit chubby" or have "armpit fat" or "lack a thigh gap" if you truly don't want to have those things. 

I think it is a bit silly to think you cannot lead a healthy lifestyle while still enjoying life. I workout daily, eat healthy, and have a toned body but still enjoy wine, beer, cake, and burgers. I also work at a coffee shop so sugary drinks are a huge part of what I drink, on weekends especially. I have never detoxed, and fruit smoothies are amazing. People who truly want to be healthy find ways of being healthy. And it is not about the body, it is about the health. I am much happier this way to be quite honest. When I ate fast food multiple times a week and drank tons of sodas, I always felt so heavy and bloated and not energetic in the least. You don't have to eat totally clean but not trying to eat a balanced diet everyday is not good. I am not a super fittie, I don't eat "clean", I just eat right and do whats right for my body. If you do not want to be healthy, that is fine. But to say you can't be healthy and enjoy yourself at the same time is ridiculous. 

Another thing, you don't have to let the healthy lifestyle consume you. Sure you can get caught up in it from time-to-time, but if you treat yourself every so often you stay on track more. Hence me drinking wine and eating cake. I often get judged or made fun of by co-workers for bringing in baked chicken or quinoa or spinach, but I often laugh at them because they are overweight and making fun of *me* for being healthy. 


But anyways, for the third time, my point is that if you want that body, you will get that body. You will work for it and eat right and you will still know how to enjoy yourselves. The biggest problem with fitness today is that people have your attitude. They don't know how to balance out the lifestyle. 


EDIT: Oh and one more thing! I used to eat totally crappy and weight 20 lbs more than I do now. I used to skip lunch and feel bad about my body in middle school and sometimes in high school. I'd count calories like crazy. But I realized it wasn't the right way to do things. I grew up, I got educated, and now I am on my way to becoming a personal trainer and nurse. Like I said, you will do it if it's something you truly want. Just don't be one of those girls who makes fun of others for doing it.
