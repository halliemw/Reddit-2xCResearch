I've had to go to court to give testimony about the drunk guy who hit my car and that was a little unnerving. It was just me, the prosecutor, the judge, the defendant, and his lawyer so not a ton of people but it was very formal (it was a restitution hearing so no jury). 


I looked it up and it seems like there will be 7 people on the [grand jury in Oregon.](http://courts.oregon.gov/Multnomah/General_Info/Jury_Service/pages/grandjury.aspx) Usually, there are not any questions from the defense. Do you know who told you that? A grand jury is supposed to be done without a judge or the defense. It is just a prosecutor, the jury, and whatever witnesses are called. 


To help, try practicing your story in the mirror and especially get the dates and times down. If you're very familiar with the sequence of events it might be a bit easier. 


I also found [a little bit of info on grand juries themselves.](http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-procedure/how-does-a-grand-jury-work.html) I know it says 23 people but that is not the case in every state (CA is 19 I believe and the Oregon website says 7).
