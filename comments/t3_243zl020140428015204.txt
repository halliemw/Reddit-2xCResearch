I second this.  D-mannose is THE BEST.  I don't understand why doctors don't suggest it.  I've talked to at least five OB-GYNs about UTIs and they recommend a whole host of preventive measures but I had to hear about D-Mannose from a Whole Foods employee.  WTF?  It is by far the most effective tactic I've ever tried.
