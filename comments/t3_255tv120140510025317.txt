You're right, but Claire's Law definitely has limitations. Many people who are abused never go to the police, so it's not recorded. And many cases are dropped or the abuser acquitted due to lack of evidence or witness non-compliance.

I would say a good rule (and one I intend to follow in the future) is to get out as soon as you see "that side" of your partner, as you put it. Don't wait to see if things will improve, or if s/he is just going through a difficult time, regardless of how much you love them. It's never worth it, and the longer you stay, the harder it is to leave.
