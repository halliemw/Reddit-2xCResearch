Next time use boric acid. Years ago I was having recurrent YI and BV and it was the only method to cure me (months of everything else did nothing). 

Two weeks of inserting boric acid, follow up of once a month or bi-weekly and I haven't had an infection since. You can buy the powder at the chemist for Â£10-15 and one bottle makes 30-40 gel caps (you need to buy those and make the pills yourself). 

Do not take orally, it is bug poison but it's a suggested treatment (my gyno. pulled out a big book of alt. treatments and suggested) for untreatable yeast infections.
