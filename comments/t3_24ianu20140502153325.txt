This is spot on! I appreciate neutral, respectful interaction, when someone genuinely approaches me and talks to me like a normal human being. I'm a very open, social person and thus constantly have conversations with strangers approaching me at coffee shops, on transit, etc. Even though I have a boyfriend, I won't ignore or block out polite guys who just compliment me. I definitely feel flattered and thank them, and that's that. Heck, there's days where I get a nice compliment from a nice stranger and it makes my day, or even week. 



This is completely different from what I was referring to in my original post. 
Having creeps "scan" you from head to toe, yell at you from your car, give you creepy looks, take PHOTOS of you, and make some nasty remarks under their breath (or vocally) is NOT polite nor respectful. Eeeeeexactly what /u/SENKI and /u/boulverser both pointed out. I doubt any pervy dude yelling sexual remarks out of his car is wanting to get to know the woman, but rather finds it entertaining and EMPOWERING trying to get her attention by making lewd, unacceptable comments about her body. Any human being who expresses a sincere interest and wants to genuinely get to know another human being wouldn't treat someone like a piece of meat used for sexual gratification.
