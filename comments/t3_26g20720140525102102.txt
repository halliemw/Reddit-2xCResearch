If you're absolutely adamant about doing them at home I would recommend using a tweezer. Take a little under eye concealer and apply it to your eyebrow first until you get a shape you like. It'll create visual lines for you to follow and you can get a better understanding of arches and length before you start removing hair. There is no real universal shape for everyone so work with the natural arch you have. u/readmycat is spot on about how to shape. Also, don't use a magnifying mirror while shaping. It's easier to keep everything even if you can see both at the same time. 

If you find yourself too nervous to commit to tweezing try removing the straggly hairs around the eyebrow first. Just cleaning up will make a world of difference.
