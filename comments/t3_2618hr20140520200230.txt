You know what's amazing? When people purposely misinterpret your words and falsely quote you in order to suit their preconceived labels. Because if I don't immediately condemn harassment as random and meaningless, I must be blaming the victim as culpable in their harassment. 

Because the world is black and white and women aren't allowed to critically examine a situation, I must either be a misogynist or radfem.
