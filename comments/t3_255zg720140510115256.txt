I am sure you have done this. You may want to make sure there is someone to take of wife (her sister, your parents, her best friend) for after you go. I am not sure what the financial situation is. When my husband was in Iraq, stuff fell by the wayside because I felt overwhelmed by all the stuff I had to do by myself. The second time he went to Iraq, I arrange to stay with my best friend for the first week and visit my Dad for the next week. It made getting out of bed, showering, getting dressed for the day more easy. I ended up staying with people for a whole month, but at least everything was taken care of.

If you arrange to have someone stay, they can make sure the kids are at least getting fed, clothed and off to school. They have a lot of support for Army wives, I don't know if your health care offered something similar.

So sorry to hear about your situation.
