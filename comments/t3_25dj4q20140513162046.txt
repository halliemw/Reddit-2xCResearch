I agree that he's just a self entitled guy who went for it. I agree that "oh I'm gay that's just how I am" is not an appropriate excuse. But where did he get the idea that it would be? I am explaining the context behind it. OF COURSE IT'S CONJECTURE! So is you assertion. For all we know her boyfriend really was hitting on him (which still wouldn't justify it).

The fact that he is gay is obviously relevant as to why the friends approved of and reinforced this behavior because they said things like "He was confused." "That's just how gays are." and "He probably just wanted a quick hookup.". 

I just know this is a likely scenario because I took a graduate level "American Cultures" class recently where we analyzed this exact same effect with several rights movements including the gay rights movement. People would often say the exact same things to justify behavior that is wrong. This kind of thing happens when you embrace a new culture, some bits don't fit in right. Some aspects of gay culture, especially loud and proud culture served a purpose, but have no place in a society trying to accept them. But people being over-zealous to not discriminate may confuse this behavior as part of the identity for the reasons I stated. 

Just because there is a simple answer doesn't mean there is not context behind it. Why is my pen on the ground? "Because it fell" is technically correct. For people like you that is enough. But that does not mean that the entire theory of gravity is wrong just because it's too complex. Everything has a larger cultural context even if you don't like to look at it.

I am not saying he considered all of this any more than the pen considered the nature of gravity before it fell. I am explaining why he might feel like this kind of action is ok and even more importantly why the friends might as well.
