You're totally right. 
To quote myself from another reply
>That's definitely something I have a problem with. I am a very sensitive person and it often transitions into how I treat people. I am always overly cautious about not coming off as cold or mean, and constantly justify the actions of others in my head when, in some situations, I just need to stand up for myself and be more assertive about my discomfort.

Thanks for the reply. I appreciate your insight:)
