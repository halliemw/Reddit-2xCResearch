I completely agree, it's turned into just the female version of /r/MensRights. I don't feel like every single post needs to devolve into an us vs. them discussion. I've honestly found /r/MakeupAddiction and /r/FancyFollicles have become great substitutes for the (mostly) female discussions without all the anger and hate.

A huge pet peeve of mine here is as a mental health professional, I think sometimes commenters are doing more harm than good, albeit unknowingly.
Some of the "how should I feel" sort of posts quickly escalate into making a woman feel like she was seriously violated or abused  when in reality, if she didn't feel like that before all people are doing is unnecessarily traumatizing that person.  This doesn't apply to people who may face further abuse or escalation of course.  Just irks me, as a therapist if someone had a bad experience and told me about it, but did not feel violated....I sure as hell would NEVER try to make them feel that way. 

There's too much of an agenda here now, I think.
