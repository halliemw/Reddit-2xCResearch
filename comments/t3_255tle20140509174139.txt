So I'm actually not comfortable with this, for much the same reason I'm not comfortable with 2X as a default (and have concerns about the current list being posted). 2X is seeing a lot more traffic, some good, some bad, and we don't know what the sub will look like when the proverbial smoke clears.

Given the community shifts taking place, I don't think it's appropriate for 2X to shunt traffic to other subs without asking those subs and giving them time to consider the implications.
