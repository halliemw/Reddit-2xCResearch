I totally agree. I wanted more information from my doctor. It's extremely frustrating. My boyfriend told me that maybe it was a good thing I didn't hear much from my doctor... like, if something was really wrong with me, they would make sure I knew it. Might not be the best assumption, and I'm certainly not pleased with my experience... but I guess if the doctor isn't freaking out maybe I shouldn't either?
