It's something I've internalised from other people I guess, my mum does that a lot, growing up it usually was the first thing I heard about a woman.  And I called her and other people out on it, I even went on full blown debates with people, but it's stuck in my brain as an automatic response. I don't wear make up or give a fuck about clothes, so it's not that.
