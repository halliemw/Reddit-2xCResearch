A) You are not a breastfeeding mother. You are not even a mother. Based on your [submission history](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d7ss1/iama_guy_in_the_cube_next_to_the_guy_trying_to/), I don't even think you're a woman. Therefore, sorry dude, but you don't get to have empathy for a breastfeeding woman. You haven't experienced that and you never will, so stop trying to make this about empathy because the totality of your perspectives and experiences in life will never include nursing an infant.

B) Nursing is not something that requires empathy anyway! It requires a support system to be successful in the sense that you need those close to you on board instead of being critical and you need legislative support to be able to feed your child when and where it's necessary. It's nice to have a generally supportive community but having an individual express solidarity in public, only drawing attention to something that shouldn't be a big deal anyway, is just weird. 

C) Just fucking trust me, dude. I breastfed my kid for quite a while and I know what the fuck I'm talking about. Don't approach me and be all like "Heeeyyy there I see you've got your tit in your baby's mouth. I'm pro." Like what the fuck man no mom needs that. Just going about your business like, you know, a normal person is support enough. THAT is what the breastfeeding community needs!
