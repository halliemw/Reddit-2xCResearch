I love the idea of this, I lived in a really shady neighborhood for a while and would have loved it.

That being said, I'm flaky enough or turn the ringer off or have my phone die often enough so that it would be a nuisance to my emergency contacts - I wish maybe there would be some dispatcher or something.
