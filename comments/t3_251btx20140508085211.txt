How do you know it's no specific group in particular?

For all we know, theredpill might come here with dedication to troll. I think it's unfair to generalize these numbers towards Reddit as a whole. I'm new here too and wish this subreddit nothing but the best and find it interesting and educative, yet I'm getting hate already because I'm supposed to belong to a certain group.

I'm upvoting you anyway and want to say thanks for the explanation.
