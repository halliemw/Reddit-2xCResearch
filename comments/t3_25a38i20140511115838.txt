Why do you feel it's perfectly fine to use a vibrator, but not okay for him to have have a pocket pussy? You never really stated a reason for feeling that way. A lot of times men will feel insecure when their partner uses a vibrator or rabbit etc. They feel this way because a man's penis doesn't vibrate or have rotating beads and vibrating clitoral attachments, and they don't feel they can measure up. What is it about him using a silicone tube to increase masturbation pleasure that bothers you?
