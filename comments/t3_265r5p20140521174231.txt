As far as I know, it is permanent. I don't know the details, but I have heard him say the word 'developer' before. I am asking him to dye my hair to match my color, which is a medium brown. He knows I come in every 8 weeks, and hasn't suggested I come in more frequently. Is it possible for dye to just wash out of my hair if he is using a permanent color?
