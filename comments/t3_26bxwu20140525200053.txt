What the hell are you even talking about? The comment was attacking OP, but it's deleted now so either it was you I replied to or you don't have any of the context. And I have been through situations like that, more than once. I don't even see how your point disagrees with mine. Were you "asking for it" with your attire? Is it your fault for being an innocent woman, or is it the fault of the man/men/whoever attacked you? That's what I'm talking about.
