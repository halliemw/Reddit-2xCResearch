Do you live in a residence hall/dorm at your college? That's how I made a lot of friends for my first years at college. I didn't really get involved with clubs and sports until the second half of college, but I've made far more friends that way--probably because it guarantees that I have at least several things in common with those people, whereas the people I live in a building with are random. 

Why not join some clubs or club sports (low pressure generally) ? I think this is easiest because like I said, at least you know you already have something in common with the person--it makes it easier to start a conversation.
