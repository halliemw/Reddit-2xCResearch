I think everyone has posted some good advice on why she needs to go, but I'm not sure any of that would convince her. To me it seems like there are some big underlying anxiety issues that probably need to be addressed first. How does she handle other stressful situations? Because I know firsthand what it's like to get angry, defensive and basically bury my head in the sand and refuse to address what is stressing me. It's a very maladaptive coping mechanism. And unfortunately it will only get better when she's ready to get better.

I'd start by looking into counseling resources for her. Emphasize that you want to help and support her, and her happiness is very important to you. Don't try to force her but do try to gently encourage her to seek help. Good luck, I hope she makes the decision to take a positive, proactive role in managing her own health.
