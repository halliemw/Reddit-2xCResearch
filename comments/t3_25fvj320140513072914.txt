If reddit poses issues for you, I think this is the least of possible problems. Have you spoken to a professional before about being an empath? Perhaps it would be beneficial for someone to help you positively channel how strongly you feel. If you really must go on reddit, then make a schedule for yourself. Make a reddit hour or two where you leave helpful comments or send a private message to someone you feel compelled to help. Then disconnect yourself from it ans do something else that doesn't involve reading about the problems of others.
