I'm also extremely pale, have blonde hair and blue eyes. Constantly get teased or comments of concern about my skin ("Holy shit, go out in the sun!" "Are you sick? You look sick."). When I was in my impressionable teenager years, I used to go tanning (very rarely, my mom wouldn't let me go- smart lady) or use that tinted body lotion to make my skin look darker. It looked awful. I really hope I haven't done permanent damage to my skin...

It wasn't until I got some cuts on my face that could've turned into permanent scars that I started taking my skin care more seriously. I've grown to like my pale complexion, although I do prefer the "sunkissed" look. The point is: you can't win. People will always have an opinion on your skin being too dark or too light, and some of them will be rude enough to voice those thoughts to you. Ignore them. You can't please everyone, so you might as well just stick with what makes YOU feel happy and healthy.
