> They also didn't say anything that the world doesn't already know. Sexual assault on women is wrong, get consent from her. Great! 

The problem is many men do not know that lack of consent == sexual assault. [The amount of posts in reddit where men sleep with passed out women is appalling](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/search?q=passed+out&restrict_sr=on). A woman can't consent if she is passed out. It seems simple right? Yeah...I thought so too but alas I was wrong.
