Yeah, and this was in the middle of the hallway right outside the English office where all the teachers hung out... I've had some seriously disturbing comments by male teachers who just don't know what is and is not appropriate to say to a female student, certainly not confined just to this one incident. Educate yo'selves teachers! If 50% of your students are going to be teenage girls, you should probably know the very basics about teenage girls.
