I'm kinda in the same boat. I don't really have female friends that are close enough for me to ask to be bridesmaids, and the closest friend I have is awesome but won't be caught dead in a bridesmaid's dress (nor would I make her uncomfortably wear one if she doesn't want to).

If I eventually marry my bf, I imagine that I'd have my brother as a best man... unconventional but who cares. Or not have bridesmaids at all and just have a tiny, low-key wedding. :)
