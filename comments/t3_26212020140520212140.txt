 Maybe those that want to use the tag but also wouldn't mind getting advice, opinions, or a different perspective can tag the post and then specify that they are looking for helpful, relevant, polite and thoughtful advice only and not a debate or criticism of their choices. A good rule might be that advice/dissent/opinions can be offered in a tagged post only if 1. the OP asks and 2. It is something helpful and appropriate that a reasonable person might say to someone they cared about who was going through the same thing. For example, a post about rape where the OP does not want to report. Someone respectfully explaining the positives that could come from reporting, while not attacking her decision not to, would be an example of constructive advice. Someone telling the OP that they think rape victims are obligated to report their rape to prevent it from happening to others, is a comment better suited to a debate thread because it attacks her choices. The need for this tag has not arisen out of 2Xers dislike of open discussion or inability to handle differing opinions but rather that nobody likes to be attacked, insulted, or pointlessly debated with when they are trying to work through an issue. With a rule like this, I think we could weed out the comments that hurt people without filtering out the good advice that can come from an open discussion. Just my humble opinion. I realize this is probably way easier said than done.
