I'm setting aside some of my ashes for each of my kids for when they are 18 or so, so that they can take them to someplace that is important to them and spread them there, so that I can be with them in some small way.

In addition to this, I'm going to make some necklaces or something that they can carry some in if they want. 

I do love the build-a-bear idea though.  That is really sweet of you.
