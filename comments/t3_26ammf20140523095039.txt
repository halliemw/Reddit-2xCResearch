i am So sorry that you were assaulted (and yes, it was assault), especially in what should have been a safe place.  you did the right thing, and you have nothing to feel bad about.  he knew what he was doing.  the fact that he did the "sorry sorry sorry" bit shows that.

i used to work in a library at a college that had some special needs students as well as some that were, for lack of a better phrase, just a bit slow.  one of the slow guys in particular was a creep (asking for more help than he really needed and then standing way too close to me), but i kept giving him the benefit of the doubt because, like you, i felt sorry for him and wondered to what extent he was responsible for himself.  but he never did anything specifically Wrong per se until about a month or so later.

when i eventually busted him being a creep as i'd suspected, he was Publicly looking at foot fetish weener stomping porn.  there were several girls seated around him looking uncomfortable; when i stormed over and told him to get out, he apologized just like in your story -- immediately and repeatedly.  i told him that if he was going to apologize, he needed to do it to All the people in the lab that he was making uncomfortable by being a dirtbag, but he just cried and slunk out.

the unhappy ending of this story is twofold: firstly, it didn't occur to me until later that by shaming him i might have played into his fetish, and secondly, the school totally stuck up for and enabled him.  i'd reported him to the appropriate office, but they just said he was a "sweet, confused guy" and actually Had Him Call Me (at work, but still) to apologize and Thank Me For Letting Him Know The Rules (i let him leave a voicemail and didn't reply).

hopefully your school will handle things a bit better.  wouldn't be surprised if the creep i dealt with eventually became a much worse creep like yours.
