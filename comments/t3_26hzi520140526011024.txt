Some very good points touched on in this. Your general taser is useless if you miss. And you don't have to miss by much. Even if you hit with 1 prong and the other misses, it is useless. Pepper spray is going to be the best bet, with a taser or stun gun being good situational based option. However this is why I recommend a fire arm. They aren't for everyone I understand, but they are the most effective form of protection.
