Birth control is great for those who need it, but it may not be a bad idea for OP to give it a little time, especially if she's pretty young. She could still be growing, and pumping artificial estrogen into her body is a great way to screw up a lot of the important timing of epiphysial growth plates fusing and that sort of thing. Instead, it's something to discuss with her doctor if she has any severe period or PMS symptoms or if she wants to become sexually active soon.
