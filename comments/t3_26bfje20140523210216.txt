The surgeon thinks it may just have been genetic disposition. I never did anything too crazy to injure it initially, but it was worsened in Basic Training and only got worse over the years.    
    
Holy crap, that sounds uncomfortable! And frustrating! I hope you get answers from the neurologist. Not much worse than simply not knowing what is going wrong with your body. Sending lots of positive vibes. <3    
    
I get really uncomfortable hand pain when doing tasks like crocheting and stuff, so I stuck to brain activities. Spent a lot of time on Reddit, working on my masters degree online, and did a lot of sleeping. Sounds silly, but I've been having fun doing puzzles, too! Watched a million documentaries and caught up on some shows. I bought a ton of books, but was too out of it from meds to focus on much.    
    
That's excellent that you have been able to have a creative outlet in the past! I really hope your answers come soon and you are able to leave bed again quickly. <3
