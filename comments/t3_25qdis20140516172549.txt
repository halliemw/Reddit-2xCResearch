I would really rather it not. I'd rather see sick time in general improved so that people can have better lives all around and not have to choose between going into work with strep or making a kid's birthday for example. There'a already enough of a stigma against hiring women of certain ages so I really don't need more of that. 

We really just need to make sick time better across the board and enforce mandatory paid maternity and paternity leave.
