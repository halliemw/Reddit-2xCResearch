Yes, but there are also 'lipstick' lesbians so what definition are we going off of as far as 'normal' for people's dress to coincide with their sexuality. The book in my photo was 'how to make film that doesnt suck' because I am a film major. There are probably other photos with philosophy books as well but I cant remember anything like that.

Its not that I want people to just look at me and think, "Oh! She only likes penis! Good for her!" I just dont understand why its up to debate or why it should matter. The only times maybe it could matter is if I am trying to pursue a guy and he doesnt think I am straight but that has almost never happened. 

Its upsetting because we are continuing to let labels define who we are as people and our sexuality. So my future son cant dress nice because he will be considered a metrosexual or gay? Why? How people should perceive me should be based on my actions, not some weird assumption they have concluded because I dont wear whatever the hell normal 'straight' women are supposed to wear.
