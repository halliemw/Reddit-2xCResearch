I have a large shelf-like bum also and aerie boy briefs work really well. They're like a bikini style but with more coverage and they don't ride up and give me a wedgie like bikini style. Boy shorts ride up and give me a wedgie for some reason so I go for the boy briefs. 

They're not too expensive and come in nice colors... I just wait for the sales. Good luck, this is a tough journey. Lol
