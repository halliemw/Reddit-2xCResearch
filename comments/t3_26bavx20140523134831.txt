Holy. Shit. 

Yeah, so this is some serious business right here. I think your friend needs to learn that he's not sexually entitled to drunk girls. Especially if he's pretending to be the good guy by giving them a place to stay, because that shit makes it look seriously premeditated. The fact that he's done it twice is going to look even worse if someone makes a complaint about him. 

Kid reads like a serial sex offender in training.
