unfortunately they close at 8pm. I will be sending them an email tomorrow with pictures of progress from the past few days so they have a clearer understanding of what's going on. 
Again, I don't know if I am just being overly worried and this is a normal part of the healing or a sign of worse things. But thank you for your reply!
