I second the Danner' s.

Been wearing them for 15 years as an infantryman, landscaper, and paramedic.  I'd wear them to bed if I could, but my girlfriend would point and giggle at me.

You're going to pay a premium, but it's amazing how much better you'll feel at the end of the day if your feet are taken care of.

Re: landscaping

There is *good* money to be made in that field if you're smart.  Learn everything you can about irrigation and pesticide application.  In my state, having a pesticide applicator' s license means a starting wage of $18 or $20 per hour.  Also, being a woman can open *a lot* of doors for you, once you know your stuff.  Many property managers and board members of HOAs are women.  Several of them have mentioned to me that there are a lot of...shall we say, "difficult to deal with" men in landscaping....and dealing with the gals in my company was refreshing.  So capitalize on that shit!

Also, depending on the company/type of landscaping you're doing, remember to save some of that money you get paid during the summer.  Often, times are lean in winter time and it helps to keep the feast/famine aspect of the business in mind.
