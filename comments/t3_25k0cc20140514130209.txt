1) I ordered a surprise for my husband today, just because

2) Coming home at night to a snuggly boy, 2 cats and warm tea after a long day of work followed by school until 9 or 10pm.


That's about it for today at least. :3 (Of course, the worst part for me is waiting since I didn't specify a time.  AHHHHHHHHHH)
