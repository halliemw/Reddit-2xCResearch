Yikes.  Do you know anyone in the department well enough to share this?  If not, you could do it anonymously after the course is over (to each member of the department - but personally, I'd leave him out of the chain of emails).  Your university must also have a student grievance procedure (but don't use if you think there could be retaliation).  Your university should also have an Academic Senate where you could make public comment (if even one other student would go with you and make the same comment, it would be a stronger statement).  Shaming him in front of his colleagues is about the only thing left for you to do.  The department may have heard this many times before (there was an older prof in my program with similar issues; they had heard it all before; it turned out he was in the early stages of Alzheimer's and there was a plan afoot to get him to retire - which he did about a year after a couple of us complained to some other faculty members (who happened to be women).  

I think ombudsmen are relatively rare (I work at a university, we have only the Senate and its President/Exec to perform this function).  Mine is a public school.
