You're right, it doesn't translate well. You just compared breaking into a car to being constantly harassed and groped when you have no support system (for years). I'm pretty sure you were just being internet brave and didn't mean to compare women to property. But this is a subreddit for people who have to deal with this shit every day and internet bravado doesn't help. I didn't downvote you and appreciate your good intentions.
