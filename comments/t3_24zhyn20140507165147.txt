Have an upvote! I'm a mum to a nearly 6 month old boy, and you're damn right that I'm winging it. I'm mostly letting him lead and facilitating what he wants and needs.  
  
My dad was pretty cool. He taught me a love of music (just by having it on a lot), and the practical skill of how to mow lawn when it's crazy high. Yes, it has come in handy. He also showed me how thrilling it is to ride a motorcycle (dammit... I miss my bike! :( ), and how enjoyable photography is as a hobby. And all of it was by including me in his activities.  
  
He also taught me at a young age (5-ish) how to use our Commodore 64 so I could play games on it. I now have a Dip IT.
