It's hypocritical to say that men shouldn't hit women but you made the first act of violence and smacked him. People in relationships shouldn't physically harm each other, women aren't exempt. Although he was billigerently drunk and his actions are inexcusable, hitting a drunk angry person and not expecting retaliation was foolish on your part. If you can't get past what happened, then break it off.
