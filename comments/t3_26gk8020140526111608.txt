I find your reaction understandable, but harmful.  Most interactions with other people are positive, and spreading paranoia about what might happen when another person turns out to be bad is not a good way to improve people's lives.  This girl sounds sensible, stood up for herself, and got out of trouble when it arrived.  I'd encourage her to keep on living fearlessly, while also using this as a learning opportunity about warning signs to watch out for, to identify trouble at an earlier stage.  I would *not* say "what were you thinking?" in a blame-implying way.  That's counterproductive and harmful.  I would praise, not criticize.  She deserves confidence, not shame.
