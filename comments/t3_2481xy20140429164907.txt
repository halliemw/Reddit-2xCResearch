Wow, how interesting! I didn't know that this was something they even did. 

I do know that there will be dissolving stitches. It looks like they make the incision through the vagina up into the urethra. They told me the risks include incontinence and potential fistula formation, which are pretty scary risks. I'm glad your surgery worked out for you!
