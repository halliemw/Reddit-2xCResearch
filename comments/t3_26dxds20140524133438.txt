Well, if they work, it's no issue... but you did just make a thread about it, so I kind of assumed it was an issue.

And, well, 3 years without accident doesn't mean the equipment is safe. Equipment functioning correctly *in* an accident is what means it's safe. But if you are saying yours is safe, then there is no issue, again.

My suggestion (it was only a suggestion) was more for future orders, or if you wanted to replace the ones you already got (because you are right, it could take a bit of time, if the first pair doesn't fit, or shipping is lengthy). If you don't think that's necessary, then obviously it's irrelevant.

> And the online returns process is lengthy...

Eh... not really? I mean, the return itself is basically "fill out form, get a mailing label, package, send." The refund can take a bit longer, because they have to receive and process it first. But overall, I have had positive experiences with ordering difficult-to-fit clothes online, and I do recommend it - although you are right, in a perfect world, we'd never have to, because clothing stores would stock a better-chosen range of clothes.
