I think it was a very poor decision to make 2X a default. And I'll participate in any polls/etc. But I'm not sure it makes a difference if that's changed at this point. 

The sub has jumped from 150K to 280+K subscribers. Lots of them are great people, but we're not getting back the 2X that exited before. And it would take a lot more than going off the default list for me to have any trust in the mods here, after the way this was handled and they way they (failed to) address the concerns of folks here after the switch.
