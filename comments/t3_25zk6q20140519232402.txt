That was pitch perfect.

In the same way it can be confusing to know which terms to use when referring to a person belonging to a specific ethnic group, sexual identity, or ability status, it can be confusing to know which terms to use when referring to gender groups. 

Often, I genuinely want to engage in a neutral, inclusive, fair, and friendly discourse, but it feels as if the only words/expressions available all have potential to offend *somebody*. 

I'm just conjecturing here, but I think there is a possibility that when men refer to women as "females", they may simply be trying to have a conversation without stepping into some sort of linguistic faux pas that may be used by their critics to invalidate the entirety of their intended message. 

>If we had a female equivalent to "guys," a casual catchall term carrying no implications of age, maturity, or behavior, I think the widespread use of "female" as a noun would cease.

I absolutely agree with this 100%
