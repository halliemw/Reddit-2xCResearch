I dated a girl who had the same problem she had huge anxiety problems I always tried to help her it was hard for her. I dont understand why is anxiety really hard. She wouldget paranoid and also it was hard for her to straighten up her emotions. What made it difficult for me is that she would get mad easily and I did not like that. I am patient but I also wanted her to learn patience. For some reason it didnt work out. Onething I can say to you is to b patient. There is nothing better than to b patient.  I know it must b hard. Learn from yourself. Your reactions and also what emotions come to you at certain situations and times.
