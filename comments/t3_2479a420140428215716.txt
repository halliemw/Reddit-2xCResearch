> It shows that the person raising this as a counter point is not versed with the issue at hand. I read a lot of feminist writing and rarely, if ever, have I seen anything saying that every single man on earth is a certain way. That, simply speaking, is not the issue feminists are attempting to address. 

Susan Brownmiller, in her book "Against Our Will", said that rape is "a conscious process of intimidation by which *all men* keep *all women* in a state of fear".  This book was listed on the NY Public Library's list of the 100 most influential of the 20th century, Brownmiller was named as one of a handful of "women of the year" in [1975](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947597-2,00.html), and just generally she's talked about as one of the founders of second wave feminism.
