Yes! It was totally a security blanket for me. Mine wasn't even that long, but when I got it cut recently, she cut off about two more inches than I asked her to, which was the difference between medium/shoulder-length and still long-ish.

Anyways, I suddenly noticed that when I was in uncomfortable situations or dealing with people who made me insecure, I went to play with my hair. "Oh, you started studying for finals a month early, after baking these delicious cookies, and then went for a nice, long run this morning? How awesome!" *goes to play with long hair* ....fuck.
