I took this course a few years ago, and while it was valuable, it did not equip me to handle the most common assailants - friends. The RAD course I took didn't even mention this possibility and when it happened to me I froze. 

Maybe the course is different now, but it focused on the "crazy stranger in a dark alley" scenario which is way less common that the "friend that gives you a ride home from the bar" or "boss that grabs your leg" or "boyfriend is a bully" scenarios. Being mentally prepared to defend yourself from someone you know and trust is just a whole other set of skills. I wish the RAD type courses dealt with this because it is by far the most common form of assault.
