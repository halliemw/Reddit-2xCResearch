... Rwanda! With 64% in the lower house and 34% in the upper house. Sorry, I just dislike cliff-hangers in link titles.

USA is 84th at 18% & 20% respectively. Canada is 55th at 25.1% and 39.6%. The full list is [here](http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm)

Super interesting article, thanks for sharing! 

It's really interesting to see this for countries where women, by most standards, have less equal opportunities compared to men, and yet still beat many developed countries. For some of these, I wonder how class differences play into things. For example, higher-class women in Pakistan might have more similar educational opportunities compared to their male peers than impoverished women.
