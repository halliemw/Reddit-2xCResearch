I started a new job position and then found out I was pregnant 2 months later. I held off telling my employers until I had passed my probationary period. When I told them, I was so very upset and felt terrible for letting them down. But everyone was perfectly ok with it and I worked there up until 2 weeks before I was due, took my maternity leave and then returned to work. I've been employed there for 3yrs now (4yrs including my mat leave) and I have never felt they resented me for working there such a short time before getting pregnant.  

I wish I could help you sort out the mess with your ex-partner and also your choices for yourself and your pregnancy. But I personally can't give you any advice on that, I just hope you have enough support around you to make the best decision possible for yourself. Good luck and hugs to you.
