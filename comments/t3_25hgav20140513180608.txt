Yeah, I saw it on /r/atheism. What worries me about Christian extremists is that they are getting pretty close to too much control. For example, last year in class I had to sit by this guy (crazy religious) who thought that all women should have to wear a "Christian" version of the burka. This is pretty much where these dads from the article are going.
