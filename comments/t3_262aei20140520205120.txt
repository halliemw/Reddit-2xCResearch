So would you rather reduce that number through coercion and force, or through education and empowerment? Because that's what the debate really comes down to- if we ban abortions, yes, we make it harder for women without means to attain them, but we're not addressing the problem of unplanned or unwanted pregnancies.  

We know the answer- it's not rocket science - access to accurate sex ed and birth control drastically reduces abortion rates. But sadly the same people who are so gung-ho to ban abortions are almost always against the very things that could prevent abortions.
