There are people have that attitude about everything though.  

You could be having the worst week ever and they'll say "well it could be way worse. It's not like you're living in nazi Germany or something." 

Which, fine, sometimes it's good to take a moment and be grateful for the things you do have, but then there are times where you're allowed to have a bad day.
