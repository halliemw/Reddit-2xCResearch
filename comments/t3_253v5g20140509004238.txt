I might try a little bit of Vaseline if things get too terrible. I'm a little hesitant to try it quite yet because I wanna try an ice pack first. Thank you for your reply though, I really appreciate it and maybe I'll try and take an antihistamine before bed tonight because they make me really sleepy.
