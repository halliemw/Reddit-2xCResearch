well, i'm not sure i would phrase it exactly that way.  what i would say instead is that talking about and judging women's appearances when they aren't present is a known and proven way of gaining plaudits among a group of men (at least at this moment in western culture - i'm not an anthropologist and am not qualified to comment about other cultures or periods of history.)  that is clearly sexist.  individual decisions to participate in that form of social interaction are consequently also sexist.
