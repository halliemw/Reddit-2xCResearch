Replying from my phone at doctors office so sorry for typo/formatting errors. I really contemplated going to the ER or urgent care but I since I was able to get an appointment I rushed here when I could. I am lucky to have a very kind and intelligent doctor so hopefully he'll know for sure what's happening to me :( I just wanna go back home and curl up in bed
