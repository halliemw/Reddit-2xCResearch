I work with family members too and it IS a nightmare but for other reasons (thank god they get their work done but they DO make asses of themselves at company functions).  Just do your own thing.  I am sure their poor work habits have not gone unnoticed but if you get upset with them, that won't go unnoticed either.  If it gets to the point where one/both are getting confrontational, tell your supervisor/HR person.
