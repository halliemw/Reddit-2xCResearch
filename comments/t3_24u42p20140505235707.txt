>First, have you taken any over the counter medication like monistat for that yeast infection yet? 

This really isn't a great idea. OTC yeast meds are great when you know for sure it's a yeast infection, but it's best to have the first one diagnosed by a doctor, especially if you're not sure as OP says she is. Yeast infections can be hard for the inexperienced to differentiate from a couple of other conditions, some of which can be serious like chlamydia and gonorrhea. 

This is why the packaging for monistat and the like actually says to go to a doctor if you've never had a yeast infection.
