It makes me so sad. My best friend is a new mother and she had her first negative experience with breastfeeding just the other day. She was at the mall, and needed to nurse her baby. All you could see was the very top of her breast- no more than what you would see in a tank top or some other low cut top. A nasty older woman walked by and told her to nurse her baby in the bathroom because my friend was being "indecent." 

Whenever people say shit like that, I want to say, "Would you eat in a public bathroom?" People are awful.
