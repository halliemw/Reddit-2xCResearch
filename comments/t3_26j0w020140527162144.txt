I've spent a fair amount of time around the men's rights movement and I disagree with your saying his attitude lines up with theirs. There is certainly some anti women sentiment over there but it is mostly a paranoid "all women are out to get me" sort of thing where they think women are lying and cheating and doing similar things. Now I don't condone this sentiment, but it is pretty wildly different from feeling entitled to women. The mgtow movement even more so. The main view of that movement is abstanance from all relationships. That's pretty much the opposite of this guy.
