> I know that in academic feminism, this is not actually the case, but college/Tumblr 'feminists' are propagating a standard that does not exist and that alienates men, as evidenced by the guy who deleted his comments.

That person't comments were not, in fact, evidence of your supposition. The assertion that *only bigots use the term rape culture* is as offensive as it is wrong, and has no place in this sub. I'm a guy and I reported that comment to the mods and requested the user be banned. 

I'm *really* not sure how you can see the deletion of offensive and wrong BS like that as **proof** that young women who identify as feminists *are alienating men*. I think we both know that it isn't proof of that.
