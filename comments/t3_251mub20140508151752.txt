Well, as an American woman, I wear a shirt when out in public. It covers my chest. In many areas of the US, it's considered public indecency for women to appear topless. And yet men are allowed to walk in public shirtless. Both genders have breasts (of a sort) and nipples. Women's breasts serve a biological function, but also a sexual one. I would also say that men's chests can serve a sexual one as well (I like looking at men's chests, anyways). 

So - is society here oppressing women by imposing norms with regard to shirts? And, if I decide to wear a shirt every day, is it my true choice, or am I just conditioned to do so?
