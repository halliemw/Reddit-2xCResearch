^  Be direct and assertive.  Some people will latch on to any attempts you make to "Soften the blow" as their window of opportunity to win you over.

Honestly he will probably feel kind of embarassed  after having chased you and might try to protect his ego by saying hurtful things.  Just don't let it get to you and realize that if he does get angry in respons it just reflects about him and not necessarily you.
