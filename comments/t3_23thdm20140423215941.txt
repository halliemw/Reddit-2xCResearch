I don't think he is necessary evil.... Maybe super socially retarded. And clearly not used to dealing with grief. I have had previous incidents where he was terrible at dealing with illbesses/deaths (for example, when I found out my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer at dinner, the first thing he said was "was the food good", and when a girl my friends were close with died, we spent the night together at my house watching movies, and his response was "have fun at your sleepover!" 

Ugh.
