Do you have a source for the birth defects caused by older men? I'm just curious because in my bio class (it's Biology 1009 so it's just an intro class and didn't really go in depth into this) we learned that paternal age doesn't really affect the defects of the baby.


Here's a quote from my professor's lecture:

"Sperm in men form throughout life and damaged sperm are outcompeted by healthy ones, so men have no biological clock for unhealthy sperm"
