I think that situation and an ectopic pregnancy (not a regular pregnancy) are two very different things.  Your birth control will prevent an egg from implanting in your uterus but not in your ovary (which is what happened). Had it not implanted where it did, it would have been nothing. Its just a really unfortunate thing that bodies do sometime.  I find it really difficult to place responsibility on a partner for your body doing something its not supposed to do.
