No, it's not wrong of you. For some people, sexuality is a fluid spectrum - it's a natural feeling. 

Where to start? PlentyofFish.com is a free dating site where female friends of mine have met girlfriends, also match.com. Then there's meetup.com where you could join a group of women for group activities (book clubs, rock climbing, tetherball, underwater basketweaving, etc.). Take some gal pals and hit up any gay bars in your area. 

I met my now-wife online on a blog. We became friends, traded Facebook invites, and we've been married since the end of 2012. 

Good luck!
