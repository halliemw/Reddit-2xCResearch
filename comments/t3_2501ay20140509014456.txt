I'm sorry, but I've reread the two posts you have replied to, and am still at a loss as to why you think that.

Would you mind rereading these paragraphs with fresh eyes?

>I'm not saying that /u/throwawaygggf should assume he's ignorant instead of malicious. I'm saying she should keep in mind that either possibility could explain things, instead of going in with preconceptions

> [W]ould I say it's more likely that he's private than lying? No. I wouldn't even give them equal odds. I'm just saying that that other possibility exists; OP should not go to this conversation having already convinced herself that he's definitely a douchebag and a liar (or, in fact, that he's ignorant and private). Deciding now cuts off options.

I don't see myself offering him leeway or assuming the best at all. I'm arguing that this interpretation (an ignoramus with severe cell-phone privacy boundaries) is reasonable enough to be worth considering when we offer advice to /u/throwawaygggf. Is it really consider such a small possibility that it's as worth discarding as, I don't know, it was actually the man's twin brother or split personality?

As for the violation and risks faced by OP, I can only say I don't think I am, and that I consider them with extreme seriousness. Is even offering up the possibility that the man's actions don't arise from maliciousness somehow minimizing the transgression against her?

Should I say again that I 100% advocate /u/VGWritesalot's suggestion? It both secures and announces OP's position and her rights, and leaves open the opportunity for the man to either cool down and apologize (whence OP can decide if he's worth the hassle of continuing association) or to reveal that he's a douchebag.

I'm not sure why it would be relevant when I found /r/TwoXChromosomes. I was inspired to visit this time because I saw it made a default, but does it put your mind at ease to know that I've lurked here rarely since around the time I registered?
