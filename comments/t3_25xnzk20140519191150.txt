Given that male and female characters are objectified in having physiques that go beyond perfection, I suppose the only way you could sexualise men any more would be to give them an unrealistically bulbous package to offset the average size of women's chests. 

Given that most artists actually draw that area of the male character as being virtually nonexisent, I think you have a valid point, at least in that regard.
