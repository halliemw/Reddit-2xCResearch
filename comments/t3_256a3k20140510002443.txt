Yep, it's not just you - me and my friends always 'spot-check' each other regularly when we're on shark week. 

And,
1. Yes always!
2. I used to wear tampons + pads but I realised that was a litttttle bit excessive and now i'll wear thin liners with them.
P.s. you could talk about the bubbles. *shudder*

Yeah, the down voting seems a bit silly :P
