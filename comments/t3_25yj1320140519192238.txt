For the most part the cramps are gone, and stopped pretty much right away. I still get pains that I never had before the iud, but they are not too bad and they are rare. I don't think they did anything special when they removed it. I remember bracing for it to be terribly painful like the insertion, and the nurse was like "It's out!" before I even realized what had happened. When I got the thing inserted they told me that there were few side affects and that I could work that night. Man, they let me drive myself home. I puked over and over again from the pain and had to leave work early and could barely drive. It was awful, so I planned to have my partner drive me home after the removal and made sure I had nothing to do that day, but it wasn't nearly as bad. A few mild cramps and faint nausea, but over in under an hour.
