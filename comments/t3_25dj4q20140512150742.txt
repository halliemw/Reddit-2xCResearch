On what planet should gay people not be held to the same standard as non-gay people when it comes to forcing yourself on someone, owning your behaviors, being respectful, etc?  Your friends sound a bit clueless, to put it nicely.

Your gay friend is probably really embarrassed by his behavior, and already knows what he did is unacceptable.  If he doesn't, he needs a firm refresher course in "respecting boundaries 101."
