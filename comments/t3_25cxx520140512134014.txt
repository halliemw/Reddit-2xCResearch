This I remember one time I was at work( I was 16 bagging groceries) and I had just gotten news that my grandmother had passed away from a phone call- So I hang up the phone and the next customer comes up and I ask them if they want paper or plastic- she proceeds to ignore me asking her till the third or fourth time, then instead of answering my question tells me I need to smile and that i should have no excuses because it's part of my job- I needless to say I walked over and bagged for a different check-stand because I almost lost my shit.
