I've not found a way to beat it. I'm relatively slim (think, completely flat first thing in the morning) and then throughout the day I gradually pooch. I'm assuming it's a food thing but since I like food I'm not really worried about changing that. When I have to wear something fancy and therefore it can't be covered with a belt (and typically when I'm out in the evening and eat and/or drink ~~alcohol~~ anything) then I've tried wearing control pants but then I just end up feeling nauseous and generally horribly bloated. It sucks when we're told we should look like we're olympic athletes on a 24/7 basis, but my rule is to just suck it in when a camera appears. If there's no photographic evidence it never happened, right?

Tldr: It's food, and as others have said too: hormones.
