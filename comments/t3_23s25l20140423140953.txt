My abusive ex was never physically abusive to this level, but he abused me all the time mentally, physically, sexually... One of the ways that abusers do this is by making you believe you 100% need them and by scraping away your confidence and self-esteem. He's probably been subtly (or not so subtly) manipulating you and making you dependent on him for a while now. I used to spend hours in guilty feelings, considering all the things I had done to supposedly deserve my abuse. Our relationship was very volatile, and having said somethings I wasn't proud of either in the heat of arguments made things more confusing. He'd "apologize", but always blamed me for his outbursts. He always twisted things to relieve himself of ANY and ALL responsibility. Does any of this sound familiar? 

When this ex of mine split up with me, I struggled with the same thoughts: Shouldn't I, the injured party, have been the one to break it off? Why did I beg him to stay after everything? 

Truth is, being abused by someone doesn't mean there's no love in the relationship. It means that between all the good times, there's terrible times of fear and anguish. When you're "in it", you always see both the good and bad times. You don't just see the man who hits you, you see the man who brought you flowers and sang you songs.

I don't know if it's always like that, but I was only able to really gain perspective on my abusive relationship after it had been over for a while. From a more distant perspective than yours, I'm just glad he's away from you. This man is dangerous and I'd keep my distance, if anything, to let yourself heal emotionally and gain some perspective.
