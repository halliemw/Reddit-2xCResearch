When men decide for themselves whom to reject and whom not to reject, it's because they just "have preferences", "have no control over who they're attracted to" (this kind of talk is all over the Louie threads right now); it's simply biology and evolution - hard-wired and impossible to change. When a woman has any kind of standards for herself whatsoever, she's a shallow, picky cunt, apparently.
