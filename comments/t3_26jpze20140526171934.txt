I was told when I had my biopsy and it turned out to be a fibroadenoma that if it's painful it's likely not cancer. BUT you should go to the doc anyway and find out if it's an infection or something causing the inflammation. Please see a doctor that will give you the medical care you ask for, you deserve that.
