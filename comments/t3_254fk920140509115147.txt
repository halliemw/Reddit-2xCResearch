She is super adorable.

Build quality on the goldieblox is mediocre. I was ridiculously excited to get them for my daughter. She's had them 2 months, and half of the axles don't stick into any of the blocks or wheels anymore. It feels like the tolerances are too loose, so as they wear down a bit, they don't work like their supposed to. I love the idea, but I'm disappointed in the result.
