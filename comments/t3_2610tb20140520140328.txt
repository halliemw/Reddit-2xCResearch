I'm sorry OP. I was in an abusive relationship and it really messed with my head for a while. I did the whole "blaming myself" thing too and kept on wondering if I deserved the way I was treated.  

It takes some time to get over and I still struggle dealing with it and I left over 4 years ago. But at the end of the day I realized I was worth more and that my happiness was paramount. Nobody should make you feel worthless or useless!   

Something that has helped me immensely was developing a hobby so I could feel good about myself. I took up running, it gave me an outlet and allowed me to find something I could feel accomplished with. I know that might sound kind of weird but I feel it helped clear my head and give my self-esteem a boost.
