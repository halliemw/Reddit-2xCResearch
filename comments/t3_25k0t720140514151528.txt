> IUDs destroy your cervix and make you sterile.

This wasn't true, exactly, but a specific brand called the Dalkon Shield was pulled off the market in 1974 because it was causing infections that sometimes led to sterility. Sadly it gave the IUD a bad reputation I think it's only recently recovering from.
