OMG this. I pull the strap thru and turn the buckle to the inside of my ankle on shoes where that's an option and have never cut or scratched my ankle. I'm not sure how people can claim that it would happen on the inside of your ankles but magically doesn't on the outside? Anyways, that's what works for me!
