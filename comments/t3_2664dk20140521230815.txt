Actually, FreeCookies had a really interesting response that she has a specific phobia.  

I don't think a person's individual discomfort should factor into play on all matters, especially on what is right.  For example, in the past during Jim Crow times, people have been uncomfortable about sharing a bathroom or common area with a person of a different race, but, this is clearly a problem with that person's own thinking, and not something that should weigh on the person of the other race.   As you said, this is a time-sensitive necessity, so I think the discomfort of others is really their own burden to deal with, and should not be placed on the breastfeeding mother.
