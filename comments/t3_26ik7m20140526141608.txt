Yeah, but I could get snap judgement from people for wearing bright purple lipstick, having tattoos, wearing a t-shirt with a certain football/baseball/basketball team on it and a million other things. No one says "Well if you wear a [insert sports team] t-shirt, people might make judgements about you."  

I don't understand why tights as pants seems to be where people say "Woah there, not appropriate, people might think differently of you than you want them to."
