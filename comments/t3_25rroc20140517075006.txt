Cap designs aren't meant to be fashionable. They're meant to be fun and tacky. I don't get your point. Mine had a Mickey Mouse silhouette made with autism awareness puzzle pieces &amp; a ninja turtle with some sais plus the psych symbol because I was a psych &amp; child development major. It meant something to me. I'm sure there are those there that saw it "tacky" but it's kind of the point.
