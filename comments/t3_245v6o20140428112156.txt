I've been a gamer from a young age, but I only started playing games where you interact with other players recently. I haven't experienced any harassment in-game, but I also don't advertise that I'm a woman. 

I've seen some derogatory comments from other gamers about women, but honestly not as much as I expected. 

The majority of my negative experience as a woman who games has been IRL. Guys find out I play video games and suddenly it becomes a test for me to "prove" that I play and I find myself defending the games I play. Yeah, I play the Sims sometimes but I also play Bioshock, TESO, and classic N64 games. I fucking hate that shit. I've never once seen this kind of "testing" of a male gamer.
