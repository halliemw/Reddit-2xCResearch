While you're right that Paragard does prevent an egg from implanting in my uterus, the copper ions also act to inhibit the movement of sperm... so his swimmers were just really strong. Furthermore, my doctor seems to think that my ovary didn't even release the egg, and the sperm made it's way all the way up to my ovary and conception happened there.  While this can't be proved-- that would mean it had nothing to do with my body doing the wrong thing.

This thread just made me realize what being a sexually active woman fully entails- my fault for not researching this sooner.  Aaaand now I dont even want to have sex anymore.
