Just chiming in to add another voice to the "I had it, don't worry" chorus.

I was diagnosed with high risk HPV when I was 25.  I immediately had a biopsy and then had the LEEP procedure (as described by /u/m1ghtymouse).  I was SUPER scared at the time and wasn't sure what to ask, especially since my dr wasn't telling me a lot and she was acting like it was no big deal.  So I did some research online and found out how common it was.  I took the time when I was at home and calm to write out a list of my questions and scheduled an appointment with her just to talk.  

As others have stated, it's common and once you have it there is really nothing you can do about it other than to keep up with your paps.  After the LEEP, I did every 6 months for 2 years and then went back to annual visits and I've been mostly good since then!

The one thing my doctor said to me that made me feel a lot better was "If you get regular pap smears, we'll catch any new problems in plenty of time to treat.  We won't let you get cancer."

I also had the Gardisil shot even though I was at the outer edge of the age range, so I feel comfortable I won't be infected with one of the other high risk strains.

Feel free to PM me if you need to talk or have any questions!
