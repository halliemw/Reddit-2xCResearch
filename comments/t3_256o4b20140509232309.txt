I'm sorry that you had a bad experience! that's frustrating and it doesn't make any sense that she would just dismiss you like that.  Keep calling doctors til you find one that will do it for you - I have a copper IUD and it's worth it, even if you have to spend a few hours on the phone.



Hormonal BC has the same effect on me as it does to you.   I asked my doctor for a copper IUD and he said "you're aware all the risks, and of the small chance of perforation?  Ok.  I will refer you to a gyno who is skilled at inserting IUDs. Anything else I can do for you?  Did you do that blood work I ordered?"   - yah it was a non issue.  


I might be naive here, but I hear many posts here about doctors refusing to give thier patients IUDs.  WHY  - why are they so against IUDs ?  It makes no sense!
