Although there are women who experience menopause very early like mid 30's , it is highly unlikely that you are menopausal at 24.
It sounds like PCOS to me. Whatever it is , it is a serious distribution on your hormonal system , and you need to go to a doctor. 

EDIT: I just saw that you are on a hormonal implant for a while. Any "menstrual period" that occur  while on hormonal birth control is not real in a sense that is not occur by normal endocrinological function. If you have problem with your "periods" while you having a hormonal implant, your implant is the problem. Since you have it for a whole without problem, my guess is the implant  is wearing out and doesn't release enough hormones anymore. Go to your Dr fast, and use alternative birth control in the meantime.   There is a good chance that your implant doesn't release enough hormones to protect you against unwanted pregnancies anymore.
