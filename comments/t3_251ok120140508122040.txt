> Respond to their ignorance with education, with grace and aplomb.

It isn't my responsibility to educate anyone. There are literally thousands upon thousands of resources that are a mere google search away, if someone can be bothered to make use of a search engine. Why should I come to a woman-centric sub and spend time trying to shove knowledge into people's ignorant, unwilling heads when I just want to discuss things that are relevant to me as a woman?

And **WHY** should *I* respond to concern trolls with grace and aplomb? I'm a woman - this space is supposed to be for me and other women like me. Men are welcome, of course, but why should **I** be expected to maintain a sense of decorum if others won't be held to the same standard? It is possible to say something in a perfectly civil way which is a COMPLETELY shit opinion.
