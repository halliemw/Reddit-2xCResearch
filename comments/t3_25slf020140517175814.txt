I worked my way up from waitress to supervisor to assistant manager. The owner had final approval for all ideas (menu changes, marketing, staff changes, etc). He would shoot down every idea I had, even though I knew they were good. 
The manager was male and never had this problem. I asked him to present one of my rejected ideas as his own. It got approved without scrutiny.
