Ack! They were worried my son might have that because his chin looked small in the ultrasound. I have like a billion questions I want to ask you about everything if its okay :D. 

I didn't say formula fed kids are sick, lol, but there are a lot of problems that are more likely if you don't get breast milk. It has lot of fresh nutrients in there as well as the good bacteria which formula just can't come close to.

However pumping and then feeding takes an insane amount of time. Every 2-3 hours 30 mins of feeding, 20 minutes of pumping, plus clean up? It isn't an option for most people, especially if they have jobs.
