It doesn't matter to me (I only started posting since the default status but have been a long time lurker) although I can totally see how some of the comments would make people afraid to open up. 

Example, I made a post regarding tampons and received a PM explaining in graphic detail how my uterus should be ripped from my body and I should be stabbed to death (yay, pretty bizarre) but it didn't bother me, gave a laugh more than anything. However, if somebody else receives that type of message referencing a rape/abortion/anything else personal it could potentially have serious consequences. Yes the sub was public before but the posts weren't broadcasted to a predominantly male audience.
