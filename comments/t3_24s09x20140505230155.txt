Keep in mind that the Lisak study getting thrown around here specifically focused on forcible rapes and rapes where someone takes advantage of an unconscious victim.  The study defined rape pretty conservatively and doesn't address the more borderline stuff at all.  Rape through psychological coercion, or sex with someone who is very drunk but not unconscious were not counted as rape in this study.

So really, the takeaway is that the most violent rapes are committed by a small number of repeat offenders, but we don't know about the more ambiguous stuff.
