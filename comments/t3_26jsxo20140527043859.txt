How do you know if it doesn't upset /u/sun-moon-stars just the same if she hears of women in the US getting arrested for being topless? And what if she isn't American and can do nothing to influence their laws? I'm going to safely say that the punishment for being topless in America is much less severe than the punishment will be for the women who chose to not wear a headscarf in Iran.
