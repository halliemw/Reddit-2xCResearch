My parents were really into DIY renovation, so I grew up surrounded by it (read: always trying to help out and mostly getting in the way); I gave myself an inguinal hernia when I was seven years old trying to haul a roll of carpet up a flight of stairs! I didn't really learn any specific skills as a kid, though; it was more about developing a gung ho attitude toward fixing stuff myself. We bought a fixer upper as our first house because it was cheap and I was game to renovate â€” but I feel like I have had a massive advantage over my parents because of the internet. We had FiOS working in our house before we had a working toilet, which was helpful because I could use the internet to look up the best way to install a new toilet. There are terrific step-by-step YouTube videos for just about everything; I tuck-pointed the field stone foundation in our basement with lime mortar after watching some videos, and have been told by an inspector that I did an awesome job and saved myself at least $7,000.
