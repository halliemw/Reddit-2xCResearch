 I mean, smiling *can* help you feel better.

But I'm guessing this was one of those objectifying, 'you are such a beautiful creature, you should smile more' grades of sexist-driven bullshit that some will plead is innocuous when it is anything but? A stranger alone shouldn't necessarily tell you to smile more, anyway. Like, what if you're in a bad mood or there's a reason you specifically aren't smiling? I might say something along the lines of, I will be smiling once he decides to mind his own fucking business, but sometimes that aggressive expletive takes away what tact can give.
