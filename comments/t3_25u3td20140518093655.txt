We had a really small lawn growing up and my dad was afraid I'd cut my foot off so he never taught me how to use the gas mower. We had one of those old school ones that you had to use man power to just push back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. And I had to use manual clippers to clip the grass around our stone wall. 
I'd try mowing a lawn now if someone would show me how to start it and run it or if they set me up on a riding mower. I'm just always going to be afraid of weed whackers. There's no way you could get me to be around one, let alone, operate one!!
