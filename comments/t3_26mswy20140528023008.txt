>Alright, so he hates on women.  How is this different than hating on your coworkers and shooting up the office?

Uh, first of all, he didn't hate ON women.  He *hated them.*  Your wording purposefully takes that shit way too lightly.

Second, we should not have to explain to you why sexism (misogyny) is different from individual and/or personal hatred.

Elliot Rodger wrote in his diary that there is no creature more evil than the human female.  He wrote that all sexual choice should be taken away from us by society and be given to some vague council of intelligent men so they can make morally "just" sexual decisions *for us.*

If you can't see why this is a big fucking deal, then I don't know what to tell you but wake up.
