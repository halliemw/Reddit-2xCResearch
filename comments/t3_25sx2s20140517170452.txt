Look, I don't want to even use the term but a girl who is actually slutty isn't crying herself to sleep either, and that said kind of a horrible stereotype to assume that men don't have feelings too. I'm against calling people sluts and it's become a term that gets thrown around to hurt feelings and judge people into conforming to societies icky feelings of sexuality. That said there is another group that crosses genders... what then, can we use as a shameful term for the example I mentioned before?

Also, you just got up voted for giving a great response. :)

Just to close, I think your assumption that there isn't a hookup culture for women is a poor one. There are definitely girls who aren't looking for relationships and want intimacy. Those women aren't sluts, their just plain women. Sex is a human necessity and it's very normal to seek it. The problem emerges when it objectifies the sexual partner as a tool for ego or personal gain. That fosters sexist attitudes. Those individuals should be ashamed not only for their vanity, but for the hurt that the inflict on others.
