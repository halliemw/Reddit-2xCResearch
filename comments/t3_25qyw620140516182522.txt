Some people don't experience jealousy in the same way or for the same reasons you do. If I was in your husband's position, I'd appreciate them without jealousy too. I mean, there's no reason for him to be jealous? Your ex is in your past, he's with you now; I imagine he feels secure enough in your relationship that a few sexy pictures with an ex isn't a big deal.

As for why they seem special to him? You'll just have to talk to him. He might have some fantasies about sharing that he never really talked about. Or maybe he just gets a thrill from seeing things not meant for him. Or maybe there's something different about the pictures. Or maybe you look a bit different. There's tons of possible reasons.

Don't stress about it too much. Ask him if you're curious. It might be a bit odd, but it's not anything to worry about.
