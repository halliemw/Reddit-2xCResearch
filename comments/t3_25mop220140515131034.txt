While I don't particularly think he's actually clinically depressed, therapy can still be helpful. I have a lot of issues left over from childhood (my childhood wasn't that bad, either) and therapy at least helped me to recognize when these things are effecting me, and to sometimes let them go. Not perfect, by any means, but at least I'm more self aware these days.

In terms of starting the conversation, just something like, 'hey, it seems like this keeps coming up for you. Have you ever considered talking to someone about it?'
