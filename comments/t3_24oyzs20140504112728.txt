The problem with "ignoring" that type of guy, is that they feel so entitled to what they want that they become agressive and harassing if you deny them the attention/attitude/acts they want. That's not unique to this type of case - the number of men who will call you a slut and spread rumors and threaten to rape women who refuse to go out with them, or just downright calls out their misogyny is appalling. Online, it's a nuisance. In real life, it can easily become a threat. It goes a lot further than "bullying".
