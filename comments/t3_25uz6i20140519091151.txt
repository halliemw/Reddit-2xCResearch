Yes. This. Mutual masturbation can teach your husband a whole lot. Observing and sharing what feelings and what rhythm and pressure, what specific areas you liked to be touched in can be a really great way for him to learn about you...and vice versa.  If you masturbate already then you've had years of sexual practice and experiences with someone you love and trust (yourself) and sharing that with your partner can be very erotic and bonding.

This is especially true when you learn how men and women's bits more often then not need a little more then just penis-in-vagina to reach climax, and almost never climax at the same instant (like in the movies).

My other suggestion is that "taking it slow" may not make sense to your husband and he might have to be frequently reminded. Men can be ready to go in a matter of seconds, while women need 15, 20 minutes of introductory passion for everything to be fully lubricated and open.  It's not a rule. A lot of people like a quickie, but for starters you should take your time... he'll probably be VERY excited and enthusiastic, so he'll need to be gently reminded that you take longer than him to warm up. It's not that he doesn't know or care, it's that his passion can overwhelm his sense of time.


My final and most important point is **COMMUNICATION**  Any guy worth his salt loves to hear what his woman wants. Men love instruction. They hear "I really enjoy sex, and I want you to do this and that to me" and almost never hear it as "you're doing all wrong." Men LOVE when you advocate for your own pleasure because they are having sex with you in order to bring you pleasure. If they only wanted great sex for themselves they'd be masturbating, or they would be blatantly selfish assholes and you would have realized that before you even became friends.

Best of luck! Get excited! Get kinky! Have fun!!!!
