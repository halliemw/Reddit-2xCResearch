However, you implied that she was being forced to hide her thoughts and feelings, and now potential actions from him. Are you assuming she is afraid to tell him because he may react poorly, or violently. In which case she has given no indication of his temperament, and we can make no assumption that he is or is not unwilling to listen to his wife and be sympathetic to her evolving views on religion and abortion. Without more information from the OP, we can not assume that she is in either a controlling or abusive relationship. Is it her own desires or fears that control her actions or inactions, or is it really her spouse that manipulates her.
