I had similar issues. I pretty much consider myself family-less (my mother is only around when she wants something from me) and my step-dad died while I was in university. My partner and I struggled a lot while I finished my degree. We both worked very hard to get to where we are now.
  
I didn't go to my convocation. I didn't have time to participate in extra curriculars or get to know the people I was graduating with (big university, worked 1-2 jobs the entire time, constantly running around trying to get everything done). I figured they could just mail my degree in to me.
  
Maybe take off for a weekend and do something nice, just you and your boyfriend. Some time away from all the stress and struggle of school (especially since you're planning on going back!) and to celebrate your accomplishments, just the two of you. Get some nicer wine and your favourite meal. Maybe go camping or escape to the mountains/beach/forest. Maybe do something you've always wanted to do. You just graduated! You can do anything! Go skydiving! Ride a vespa! Buy a cute new dress! I would reward myself with something frivolous and "just for me".
