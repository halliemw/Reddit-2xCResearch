I have an old blue Supercycle bike that my boyfriends mom got for me from the police auction website for $50, after two of my bikes were stolen, and I love it!! It is honestly the best bike I have ever owned, plus it looks kind of old and junky so I feel like its less likely to be stolen. It rides like a dream, I have honestly become super attached to it in like the month that I have had it.
