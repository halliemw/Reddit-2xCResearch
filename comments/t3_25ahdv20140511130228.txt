I have that problem a bit too... I put "assisted" on my resume way too much partially because most of my jobs were like... intern, research assistant, so maybe that's okay. 

But yeah, it's hard to be confident on a resume when you're nervous about being called out. For example, I took Spanish in elementary school and middle school and college, worked abroad in Peru for a few weeks and talked to tons of people in Spanish who spoke no English whatsoever. I still try to keep up on it, but I know a lot of people speak it better than me so I say I'm proficient. Meanwhile, my husband's resume says he's fluent in Spanish. One day I asked him all about it and it turns out he took it in high school. Here I was thinking that everyone takes Spanish in high school, it's no big deal, and I don't deserve to brag about my Spanish skill. Fuck it, maybe I'll say I'm fluent too.
