There are a few people who I'd like to salvage relationships with, and I'm definitely going to try to do so. But you're right, I should do activities that I enjoy and step outside my comfort zone. I'm so shy, but it's helpful to hear about others stepping outside theirs! I can probably do it, too.

I definitely need to do that. Thank you for responding to me! You have no idea how much I appreciate your thoughtful reply. I've been wanting to talk to someone about this, but I just don't have anyone. Just having someone respond is making me feel a little better :)
