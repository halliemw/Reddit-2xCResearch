I really think he was trying to give you a compliment and nothing more. Sometimes when people, especially of the opposite gender, want to compliment you without it seeming creepy, they go for the "you've lost weight" line. Maybe he thought you were working out or something. Maybe he really does like skinny girls and you are becoming more his "type", and he's coming on to you. Or maybe because of your money troubles you might be a little sensitive to such comments and it's nothing at all. You could politely ask him to lay off the weight comments though, they aren't very professional. 

FYI, if you like peanut butter, it's the cheapest way to get a ton of calories if you are legitimately concerned about losing too much weight because you are on a really tight budget. Plus you can eat it on so many things: bread, veggies, apples, crackers, etc. Eggs are great cheap nutrition as well.
