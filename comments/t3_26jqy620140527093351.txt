I don't think my vagina is short? I can have sex and wear tampons with no problem? Width bothers me more than length does. Someone else posted a video on how to insert the Diva Cup and it looks WAY wider than any other pictures or videos I've seen. Two of my boyfriend's fingers is enough to make me feel like I'm being stretched out. (Sorry for the TMI!) That looks bigger than two of his fingers. I wasn't worried before but now I'm a little worried.
