Not everyone has tolerable periods. You don't even know for sure if the pill made you less fertile. Just because you don't want to "mess with your body" (which pregnancy does) doesn't give you the right to call other people idiotic. It's accepted by most medical professionals that skipping periods isn't unhealthy. You may be older now, but you sure are judgemental.
