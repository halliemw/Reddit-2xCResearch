Thanks for clearing that up. I'll keep that in mind in case I accidentally give away some personal info on an account. Luckily since I've moved they have yet to find me and I'm starting to feel more safe and confident again. Also I don't like to troll, I don't really even see the point in it. It's just plain mean and disrespectful.
