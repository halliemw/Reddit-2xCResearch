Doesn't matter, fuck his mood. He did something that is egregious and violating, and it's not a good excuse to say "I never imagined how it would make you feel, I just thought about my own sexy feelings." Not good enough. You can't just barge around knocking shit over doing whatever you want, only apologizing or thinking about the consequences of your actions when someone politely asks you to slow down and take a look. That's childish nonsense. There is absolutely no good excuse for taking pictures of someone make without their permission, and by refusing to show her the phone (as opposed to saying "oh god, I can't believe I did that, I am so sorry, here, go ahead and delete it, what was I thinking?") he refuses to show her or confirm whether or not he has any other pictures. Not okay. Selfish, shitty behaviour which takes no account of how vulnerable OP is likely feeling.

Classic dickbag behaviour, completely undeserving of your sympathetic interpretation.

This is not a question of how OP can carefully slim down and refine her feelings until they are easy enough to swallow before she shares them. The point of the exercise is not to minimize the discomfort this guy is gonna feel. His discomfort is now irrelevant because he put his shitty phone over and above OP's comfort and has since not shown a hint of regretting that, it seems.

Why should his feelings take priority over hers when he has already made a point of ignoring her feelings and filling his desires irrespective of how the subject of those desires feels?

Like srsly why are you defending him.
