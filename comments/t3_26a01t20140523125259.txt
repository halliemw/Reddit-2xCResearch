> The most dangerous advice you can give someone being bullied is "ignore it."

I didn't say ignore it. I said don't engage, there's a difference. I am very particular with my wording for a reason, don't attach extra meaning to something I said. 

When I say don't engage, I mean don't talk to them, avoid them and just let them be assholes. If they harass you, you get *someone else* to engage them. I have managed to get a bully to back off by doing this correctly. I believe they ended up crying. The point is that you engage everyone else and let them see how awesome you are. That's how I got my bullies to back off, the rest of the group saw that I was pretty cool and they criticized the bullies for picking on someone who never starts anything. 

What do you suggest they do? What do you do when any action you can take is a losing one?
