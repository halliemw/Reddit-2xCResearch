I would say there are two aspects to "slut shaming":

One is the attitude that there is something dirty about sex, and that having sex for fun is immoral or a character flaw.

The other is that this apparently applies mostly or even exclusively to women. 

The latter is certainly a form of misogyny, but the former, I think, is just as important, and part of a much larger problem with how society still views sex.
