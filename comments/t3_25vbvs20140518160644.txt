I disagree.  There are times when we should restrain ourselves and not just let the honesty flow.  If I'm asked for an honest opinion and I know it's going to hurt the asker, I try to temper my opinion in some way.  I don't lie, but I don't tell the full truth.  There's no need for the full truth, as long as a person doesn't lie.  

One thing we can do in a situation like this is look carefully at the woman in the dress and listen carefully to what she likes about the dress.  "You really feel beautiful in that dress," is then an honest statement and we can leave "I think your dress sucks" unsaid.

I agree though, that some friends are prone to full disclosure, so I'm very careful not to ask them questions if I think I'll be hurt.
