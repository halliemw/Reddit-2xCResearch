If you have any more questions or concerns you can pm me. I'm 23 about to purpose to my girlfriend, so I have been in that phase where discussing beliefs is so important, being "tolerant" isn't the same as understanding. It was always come up, and if he is wanting to be the head of a Christian home, and you don't want to be in that home, then you can go separate ways understanding you have different beliefs, tolerance is more petty because  genuine beliefs will always collide. Glad you posted this, hope you find the grace to discern what you should do.
