Made it home, in bed. Still watching for my family, they are alllllll over bham. Its sprouting into two different rotations. Just ugh. I never remember this being as bad when I was a kid. That was always an anecdotal statement, but now I want to know the truth of it. Ive been reading articles about pollution driving extreme weather, I need to find some truth.

Everyone stay safe. Mississippi/AL state line was hit hard today :( My thoughts go out to you.
