Why do you think anything but accepting their advances is "mean?" It's probably not going to shake their world if you tell them you're not interested. If you find it impossible to be even a little bit assertive, you might want to talk to someone about that. A lot of people find themselves in shitty situations because they can't bring themselves to be assertive.
