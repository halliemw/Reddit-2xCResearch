He starts asking why I am out so much, who I am with, why I need to go out so much. Typically, I already know he's in a bad mood, so I back off and go out less to appease. But if I decide to challenge him on it, he gets angrier. He starts yelling at my mom for petty things, starts yelling at me to do things related to school, tells me I have to start studying (even though it's winter break!), and started pulling up loan information to remind me how much in debt I am. This actually happened last winter break, which led to me being on house arrest practically for 50% of my winter break (it was pretty much unsaid. If I actually left, hell would have broken loose).

You can see the pattern, and why I choose to limit the number of times I can go out and see my boyfriend. I theoretically could leave more, but I already know the cycle I will start if I do so. 

Hell if I know the reason why he is this strict. Reasoning doesn't apply to my dad -- if I ever bring up the subject, he just gets angry and refuses to address it and does the same cycle I explained above.
