We're the messages just via text? Maybe you can talk to your provider and find out if they can give you a copy of what he sent, or at least what you replied with? If it's on FB then you should be able to access the messages even if you've blocked him :)


In any case, you should still talk to the police with your parents. Your Mum can verify that he's been to your house (even though you've never given him your address), and you can at least make them aware of the situation. If it escalates further, it'll be easier for you to report anything else that happens :)
