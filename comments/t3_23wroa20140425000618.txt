Can you start laughing at it? I'll be honest, as hurtful as it is to you, your family is being so ridiculous about this whole thing that it reads like some kind of SNL sketch come to life. 

I'm not saying the situation is funny- I totally get that you are pissed off and embarrassed and it's is NOT COOL what they are doing.

But if denial and logic aren't working for you because they think deep down you're still bothered by some dichotomy you can't face up to- maybe outright busting into laughter at them from the utter ludicrousness of the situation will make them see it doesn't bother you the way they think t does.

This wouldn't work for forced or sarcastic laughter, just if you can genuinely see the humor in the situation of someone telling you are basically a whole different person in the worst kind of caring way possible. I bring it up because that's how my sister deals with the people who say she will genuinely want a kid and blah de blah later in life, and it works pretty well for her.
