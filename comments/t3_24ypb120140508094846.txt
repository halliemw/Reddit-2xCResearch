On more budget tip because I can't resist: some vendors (especially caterers) will give you a not-insignificant discount if you pay in cash the day of the wedding. 

It's slightly shady to pay someone under the table, because I assume they're dodging some taxes and you're sort of helping? But if you're cool with that, they will pass that savings onto you. Big time. So again, if you're comfortable with it, just tell the vendor you'd like to pay in cash and ask if there are any "discounts."
