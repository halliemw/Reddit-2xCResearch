I'm 21 and last year found out I was BRCA + 

Like the other person said its not a death sentence you just have to be really careful and get a doctor that listens to you and doesn't dismiss you.  I decided that I will get my breasts removed when I'm 24 because I don't plan on having kids till I'm older and don't want to play the maybe Ill get cancer or I won't game. 

Did your grandmother or mom get tested? Because when I went to get my test they wouldn't test me unless they had results from both of them to look to see if I have either type of their mutations. In an odd way I was lucky(?) and had the same as my mother, who was a negative until she got cancer and it turned positive, so I'm taking the actions to prevent this. 

Don't get to stuck on doing it right away because its a whole lot to take in at once even if you knew about it forever. I figured I was positive since my mother passed when I was 13 and even getting the news I was freaked me out and changed a lot of things. 

But go find a doctor that specializes in this, I don't know where you life but I love my doctor I have she is perfect and does EVERYTHING she can to help me out. 

If you have any other questions just PM me :) I'm always willing to chat about it 

edit: Also screw your doctor refusing to help you get a mammogram, I just got one a month before I turned 21. It sucked big time but I came back clean :D
