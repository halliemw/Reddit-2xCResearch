The problem with this mentality is that there are always new trolls to appear. The internet and reddit are in a constant state of [Eternal September] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September). For each troll that gets bored, another will come and harass the subreddit. Every post that makes it to the front page or near the front page will bring another wave of trolls and assholes who either hadn't gotten their "turn" with the subreddit or who forgot and want to "have some fun" again. Additionally, being added as a default has incurred the wrath of some...less than savory subs, and people like that who are so adamantly misogynistic aren't going to just get bored. For them, it's a matter of "protecting men".

While I agree that the extreme mass downvoting might taper off eventually, there will now always be a greater number of mass downvoting and trolls, and it will perpetuate a very disgusting cycle.
