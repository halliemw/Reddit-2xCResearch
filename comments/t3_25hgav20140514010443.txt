I was homeschooled from first grade to graduation. My parents aren't overprotective, and my mom has been a feminist since high school. It wasn't until I joined a homeschool group in high school that I got any of the modesty shaming so many experience. As a fat 16 year old girl, I was mortified to show my body anyway, but I (along with a few really beautiful and "modest" young women) were given a hard time by some of the parents for dressing immodestly and "causing their sons to sin." Seeing as all of us wore jeans and tee shirts most of the time, I can only imagine it was the other girls' natural beauty (and my carefully concealed, but still giant, breasts) that caused this. It still makes me mad to this day that even though I was never even asked out in high school, some parents considered me a temptation for their boys. Ugh. Policing what other people wear brings way more attention to it anyway.
