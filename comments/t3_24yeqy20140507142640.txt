The thing about low-performing schools is that there are few resources to funnel troubled kids into productive hobbies.  At a "nice" school there is a lot of theater, music, sports, and hobbies people can get involved in.  At a lower-performing school that support isn't there, so students with rough home lives have to make their own escape.  Add in that behavioral or learning disabilities are much less diagnosed among low-income students and ethnic-minority students and you have a recipe for constant conflict.

I'll never forget when I had an open house and only 4 families out of 40 students came for one of my classes.  One of the families was a quiet, friendly's girl's father who came in as drunk as a skunk at a wedding.  He may have driven there but I can't imagine how he could have navigated the hills so I assume he took the bus.  His daughter was there [we recommend parents come alone] and was basically brow-beating him around because he was too drunk to pay attention or stay seated in his chair.

When she says the school is largely african amercian it's actually helpful to me [in terms of advice] because I know a lot about how to work with chicano/latino students but so much of it is wrapped up in culture that I don't know if it would work in a predominately black classroom.
