I think it kind of depends on what qualifies as "birth control". I doubt that is limited to hormonal birth control. Things like a broken condom are one thing, and really aren't in the same category as a half-assed attempt at the rhythm method. However, many surveys just ask if you were actively trying to avoid pregnancy. People are likely to answer yes to that regardless of how they went about it.
