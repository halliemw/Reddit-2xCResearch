Electric razors don't give a close shave, so that won't remove all of the hair. Shaving does NOT make the hair come in thicker. Shaving with a normal razor would get all of the hair off, and using a quality razor and patience would take away most of the risk of nicks or cuts.

If you think you are getting more hair, and if you see it in additional places where it wasn't before, I'd consult a doctor. You could have a hormonal issue causing the hair growth.
