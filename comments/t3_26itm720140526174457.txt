You don't need to be concerned. Even women who bleed intermittently when they take a break from the pill are not having a period. And you can have the appearance of a period when pregnant (again, not a true period, but bleeding that makes you think it's a period). 

It might be worth researching the menstrual cycle and how the pill works to put your mind at ease.
