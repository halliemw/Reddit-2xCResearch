Agree with this post. I've got a decent amount of experience with folks with LD's through work, so although not an expert, I do know of guidelines in place for this type of thing.

Firstly, OP, you're obviously entitled to feel shaken up/upset/whatever feelings you have. That's not even up for debate. You're also entitled to react in the way you would if anyone else had done the same thing. If you were to speak to the police and university action would (or should!) be taken. the police would possibly take a different course of action to what would happen to a person who didn't have LD's, but safe guards would need to be put in place to ensure the man didn't do it again.

It's not about placing blame on the man, assuming he didn't understand the full weight of his actions, it's about ensuring it doesn't happen again and attempting to help him realise why it is unacceptable (if his LD's allow that). You, and others around the campus, are entitled to your safety and well being so it is important that this is flagged up. The University may already have a code of practice in place for this type of situation.
