With a few brush strokes I can completely change my face from debutante to sultry to professional to edgy. My mood is displayed in color on my lips and on my eyes, but nobody but me really knows what the colors mean. My mood also swirls around me - lean in close, you might be able to smell today's perfume. Sometimes I echo how I feel in my appearance. Sometimes it's aspirational. I won't tell you which days are which.
