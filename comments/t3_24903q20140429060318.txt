I got my Mirena at 18. 


The only legitimate reasons a doctor won't let you have one should be if he/she thinks it will cause you harm, if there is a better option for you, if it goes against that doctor's religious/cultural beliefs (totally valid, but find a new doctor for a Mirena).


I got one because I'd had the pill (combined pill- estradiol and levonorgestrel), and then switched to the implant (Implanon- levonorgestrel) when the pill gave me headaches and increased my appetite, leading to weight gain. I had Implanon for 18 months but for all of that time I had either irregular bleeding or constant bleeding (the last 12 months). So I was fed up and went to the doctor and we decided that Mirena was a valid option. 


Plus, the doctor does need to consider your wishes. I tried 2 doctors before I found one who would insert it. It's been over 2 years now and Mirena hasn't given me any adverse effects. But (DISCLAIMER) that doesn't mean it's the same for everyone!
