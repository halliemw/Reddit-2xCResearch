I haven't experienced any particular discrimination when dealing with academics either. I think that the main reason why was just that I proved myself early on and was in a small program where everyone knew each other. Even when I interacted with people outside of the program and school, I was still treated well though. 

However, I do know that I write like a stereotypical male for official communication (email, essays, etc.). After one of my linguistic  courses, I took a test to find out what gendered markers I used when I wrote. I have to wonder if this style of writing is what actually mattered, rather than the name that I signed at the end.

Edit: This is not the test that I took, but it's the same idea. It just looks for stereotypical speech markers.  http://www.hackerfactor.com/GenderGuesser.php
