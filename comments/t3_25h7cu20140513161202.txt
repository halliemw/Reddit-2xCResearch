Start with the plastic ones. The plastic is just the applicator, by the way. You insert it all the way into your vagina, hold the base, and slowly push the bottom. It basically pushes it up, into your vagina. If you do it too low, it will be very uncomfortable. Once it's in, you pull out the applicator, which you throw away (that's why a lot of women eventually switch to ones without an applicator). All you'll have on the outside is the string hanging out, and the cotton inside.

If you pull out a tampon too soon, it will hurt because the cotton will be pretty dry. If you keep it in too long, you can be at risk for infection as well as a potentially fatal TSS. So, it's important to use the right absorbency so you're only wearing them for about 3-4 hours. You should never wear them for more than 8 hours (again because of TSS). So, pads are typically the best thing to use for bed time.
