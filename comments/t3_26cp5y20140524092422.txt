That's fair enough, and I certainly wouldn't suggest ending a 4 year relationship based on a statement that they can't afford a baby with no further discussion in any case. I know even people who get pregnant on purpose often get a little panicked feeling and overwhelmed by the suddenly very real prospect of being parents. It just sounds like a communication breakdown for sure, which should ideally be addressed before there's a baby in the picture.
