This is horrendously sad to me. I also have a family affected by eating disorders and have suffered from one myself in the past. I have been underweight several times because of it, and my family, friends and strangers have always commended me for it because underweight is the ideal and I look more conventionally "attractive" that way.
The mother daughter thing hits me especially hard because I have two little sisters (one of which also has an ED and is currently in a binge/purge cycle and has been anorexic in the past). Meanwhile, I am the heaviest I have ever been, close to giving birth to my own daughter. I know the guilt and unbearable emotions that come with eating disordered family relationships. It appears that your mother is inseparable from your ED in your life. She probably has an eating disorder as well. She did what she could to protect you (like my mother did) but her efforts were misguided and they harmed you. The disease that we suffer from is referred to by some as 'culture bound' meaning that it is caused by the society we live in. Something that has worked well for me in my recovery (no binging, no purging or denying myself sustenance for over 3 years now) is understanding what I went through in a politically conscious way, understanding the role of gender, race, class, and other manifestations of oppression in the development of this problem. I now see these behaviors and thoughts of ways to distract me from my real goals, and my real enemies. I don't know if that helps but I hope there's something you can get out of my comment. I send you love and support.
