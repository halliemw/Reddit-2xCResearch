(Since tone is lost in text, this is a disclaimer that this post is not meant to be an argument, but a friendly exploration of your comments :) )

What doesn't sit completely well with me about your post is the phrase "people who actually have reason to struggle with body image." I realise where you're coming from, but at the same time I feel like it's not up to anyone else to judge what is a "legitimate" reason to feel bad about one's body. **Any feeling a person has is a legitimate feeling!** We really don't know anyone's history; someone could've had an eating disorder, or an food/weight-controlling ex, or a condition that makes it really hard to gain/lose weight, or been bullied, or ....etc. And all these reasons (and more) are perfectly legitimate and actual reasons for feeling *any* emotion, one of them being feeling bad about body image.

I don't think you're being mean at all, but my body type is very similar to OP's, and *while I think she looks GORGEOUS*, I simply *cannot* see that in myself. It literally wouldn't matter if I had a perfect body... When I was 5'3" and 110 lbs, I was starving myself because I thought I was massive. Then I gained 30 lbs and I still think I am massive. Either way I hate my body, but... this is *my* problem! And how *I* feel about *my* body shouldn't influence how *you* feel about *yours*. I honestly hope all of us find peace with ourselves, but we each have our own journey to that peace.
