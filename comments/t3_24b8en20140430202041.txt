Signing an employment contract for an agreed upon wage, is not 'wage theft'.

If you sign an employment contract for an agreed upon wage, and they then withold your wage unlawfully, that is wage theft.

If you sign an employment contract that requires weird indignities, that is not a victim.  That is a fully informed adult, making a decision to sign their name and agree to all the stipulations.

I wish people would stop assuming women need protected, have no will, no choice, no decision making or critical thinking ability, and have no agency.  

How to fix it?  Don't sign the contract.  Imagine what the NFL would do to raise cheerleader wages if  they couldn't get anyone to work for the shit they currently pay?
