1. I chose Skyla, which is slightly smaller, though not as long-lasting, as Mirena. it's 3 yrs instead of 5. 

2. I had mine placed while I was on my period. My dr recommended it because my cervix would more open. 

3. Ask your dr to numb you. Mine used a spray local to numb the area and then injected a cervical block. 

All I felt during my procedure were the cramps, which weren't even too bad. It also helps if your dr is super friendly- mine talked about my thesis with me the entire time and had me laughing until it was all over. 

The pain came later for me when the massive cramps hit. I have never cramped during periods now and now I get bad cramps every now and then throughout the month. Its worth it though. I love my IUD. 

I hope your second try go smoother!

seriously consider going in during your period though.
