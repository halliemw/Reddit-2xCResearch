I'm sorry, opinions like this rob women of power IMHO.  Saying it's not a choice is such a disempowering stance, like we have to accept it and then deal with the emotional consequences. 

Let me offer an opposing view.

*What we do as women _is_ our choice*.

*We should not feel bad for screwing up.*

*But sometimes we could have behaved in a way that would have been empowering and displayed empowerment*.

God, I get so angry at this message that attempts to protect people's feelings at the expense of better lives.   It is shameful IMO.
