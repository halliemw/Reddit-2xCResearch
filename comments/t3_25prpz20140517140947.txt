There's also a few really stable positions from a sitting stance of you have the flexibility. Standing sucks, too fatiguing and never as good as lying or squatting/kneeling. Greatest shooter in the world will always do better lying than standing. How much practice do you do with alternate firing positions? 


TBH the way you are leaning in that picture isn't that bad - you're doing it because the rifle will make you too front heavy, so you end up compensating by muscling the weapon more. Just means more fatigue. 
Do you know the marksmen ship principles?


I'm sorry if I am being condescending, I have no idea how much you know about firing positions or how much experience you have, but I did learn a lot in the army so I am just trying impart any knowledge I may have to someone who might need it. Shooting is fun, especially if you have a sweet ass rifle like that one. I mean, damn. That's a beautiful rifle.
