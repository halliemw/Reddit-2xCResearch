That is so wonderful. I'm absolutely chuffed for you both!

As someone who has just split with my LDR partner, can you elaborate for me on how you got through your break up & came back to each other again? My partner (ex?) & I are kind of hoping circumstances will change which would allow us to reunite but I don't know how reasonable that is to expect.

Again... Congratulations!
