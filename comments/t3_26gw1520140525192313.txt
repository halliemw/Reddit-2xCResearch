I go to Academy or similar sporting goods stores.  For a top I like a decent quality black sportsbra, because it looks like a swimtop, won't come off in the water, and actually supports/enhances my boobs well.  

For the bottoms I actually prefer men's/boy's swim shorts as they have pockets I can use for hermit crabs/bait/etc.   For just pool swimming I got the spandexy men's swim shorts because last year I couldn't find women's swim shorts in small sizes.

Most women won't care about the pockets issue, can't overemphasize how awesome a sexy, nice-fitting sports bra is for a swim top.  And it's cost-effective, because you also have it for your workout.
