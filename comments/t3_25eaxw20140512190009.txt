Thank you for sharing, your perspective is no doubt very valuable to OP.

Though none of us know for sure, it honestly sounds like OP made the right decision even if she doesn't feel like it right now. Even if she was not sitting the the hormonal typhoon she almost certainly is, this is likely to be the toughest decision she will ever have to make and no matter what there would be lots of regret. It was simply a huge lose lose, but I think she did the best with what she had.

Definitely seek out some therapy to work though these emotions. You don't want to misplace them into guilt or blame.
