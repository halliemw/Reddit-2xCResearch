I agree. Get Self Defence lessons, that helps way more than getting a gun or having a knife handy. Help in the way that you will be more confident and therefore can rest more easy. A gun, a knife, a baseball bat, all this doesn't help, if you don't know how to use it. Worse, those things could end up in the hands of the person breaking in.
