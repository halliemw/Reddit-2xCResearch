I haven't been bothered being called "ma'am" by strangers, especially knowing that a lot of people were raised with that habit. 

What really grinds my gears is older people feeling like it's appropriate to comment how young you look, sheesh. I'm mid-twenties working in a position where people are surprised I'm younger, but I find it beYOND rude when people tell me I look like a teenager. It's frustrating because when you point out your displeasure with the comparison, they just tease how it's a compliment, but is it? Grumble. Does anyone else find themselves annoyed by that sort of thing?
