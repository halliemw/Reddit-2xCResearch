I recently got invited to two weddings where I didn't get the invitation. One was my first cousin, who I've spoken to about going to the wedding (and got a Save the Date for), and a close family friend who I see regularly, and who sent me a thank you card from the engagement party, saying "I can't wait to see you at the wedding". 


Both people I am close to, and knew I was invited. Very coincidental, but I guess they both got lost in the mail. It happens. Maybe something with the size and shape of invites?
