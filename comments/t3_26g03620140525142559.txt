I feel like the issue here is that he payed for his crimes and regardless of what most people would want, him behind bars forever, that's just not how the system works. The American justice system is flawed, very much so. I hope that there is continued counseling and frequent check ins with his parole officer maybe even chemical castration pills. The problem is you can't just keep a bad person in jail forever because they could do something bad again.
