Oh yes, for you:

1. Take a breath!
1. Go to the doctor! Even if you change your mind and decide to get an abortion, you should still be going to the doctor and figuring out how far along you are and going on prenatal vitamins for your own health. 
1. Take a breath!
1. Talk to your boyfriend. Even if you guys decide that the right thing for you two to do is to separate, that should still be clearly communicated. 
1. Take a breath!
1. Talk to your family. Mine really surprised me with their support and compassion (they are religious, I am not). 
1. Take a breath!
1. Talk to your friends. They are your friends for a reason. Unlike your family they *choose* to be in you life. 
1. Breathe.

If you want to switch steps 6 and 1, I think that makes sense. I was nervous so this is the order I did things in.
