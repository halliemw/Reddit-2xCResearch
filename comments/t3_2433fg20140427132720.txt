This is why I do my research ahead of time, go in prepared, and go in ALONE.  Most of the time, I know more about the vehicles I'm interested in than the damn salesman does.

I did this at a Toyota dealership right after I graduated from medical school, and they refused to take me seriously.  It was 18 years before I so much as *considered* a Toyota.  Did buy a Prius eventually, so I'm over it.

You have to be blunt with these people.  Tell them straight up, "*I'm* buying the car.  *I'm* the one with the money.  Talk to *me* or I'll go find a car dealership that will."
