It's ok if you can't think of something profound or eloquent- after reading through your post, I'm positive she knows how you feel.  When I saw my grandfather for the final time, a few days before his death after a long fight with kidney disease, I could barely get any words out.  I was choking back sobs, trying to tell him goodbye and not wanting to ruin it.  
My sister had the right idea though, she wrote him a beautiful letter and after saying a quick goodbye in person, had my dad read it to him (he's more of a "rock" in situations like these).  This way she was able to take her time, get her thoughts in line, cry if she needed to, but express everything she wanted to as well.  Would it be any easier for you to try to get your thoughts down on paper?  
My thoughts are with you and your family.
