I did read the article, and a couple of other ones to get a better understanding of why it wasn't pursued criminally. The point is that if we accept the university as having authority to "rule" on these issues, then we can't just expect them to turn around and cater to public opinion once their decision has been made. Doing so undermines the legitimacy of the system. To be clear, *I* don't think it should be this way, but that is how it is when we allow universities to have authority on these matters. In another article I read that the victim said she was encouraged to go through the university *instead of* the police and consequently only filed a report months later. To me, that is way more outrageous than hearing that people that are probably not competent to make a decision made a shitty decision. It shouldn't have been up to them in the first place.

Either way, let's say they fold under pressure and go with what people are asking for -- they expel this guy who was already punished according to their code(regardless of whether we think that was sufficient, it's what happened). What if next time they find that the guy is a rapist and expel him, and then there are protests saying he should be let back in, that there wasn't enough evidence, etc.?  Then the precedent has already been set that the university's decision isn't final. 

I don't even think that's the most damaging thing, the worst part to me is that someone could be found to be a rapist under these processes and their only/worst consequence is getting expelled, because the completely incompetent and irresponsible people at the university are *encouraging* victims to not go to the police.
