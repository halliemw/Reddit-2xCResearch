I really like what you're saying here. Thank you for sharing your experience. 

When I first read the article I felt so angry because I think that, in general, it is true that doctors who are women may, in the long run, spend less time working/work less hours per week/etc. than males in the same field for any number of reasons (family being the foremost). 

Instead of looking at a percentage of women doctors as the issue for not living up to American work ethic expectations, perhaps we should look at work ethic expectations and consider whether or not they are reasonable and conducive to a happy life outside of work (for men and women--not just women).
