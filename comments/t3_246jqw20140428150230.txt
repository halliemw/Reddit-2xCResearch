I use the app, too. The idea is not to make a big project out of everything, but instead to break it ll down into tiny manageable tasks. A huge Clean All The Things! project is just too exhausting to think about; 15 minutes of picking up stuff is absolutely doable. 

That said, I'm currently on reddit instead of either cleaning house or doing my final project (due in two days, eeek!!), so I feel you, sister. 

I'm going to go do some work now. If I can, you can. C'mon!
