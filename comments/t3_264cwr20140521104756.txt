Multiple people here have called your boyfriend an "asshole" and I agree with them. I get the feeling your bf believes you are below him, how can you have a flourishing relationship when he thinks he is superior to you in every way? "women are not allowed to talk while men are thinking." -- Ok let's pretend that *is* just a joke. Who finds that joke funny? In my opinion, people who don't respect women find that joke funny.

The "just joking" stuff won't go away, and really, on some shallow level, he's *not* joking. Think about it, why is your bf saying those things all the time? It's because they are truly on his mind, he *is* thinking about those things all the time. And I'm sure he's no stand up comic who's putting together his next act, so why are those things on his mind all the time? His best response to you so far has been, "just joking", but he really needs to do better than that.
