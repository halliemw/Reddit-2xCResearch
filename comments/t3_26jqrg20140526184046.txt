Do your work, but don't let it consume you to the point where you have no time left for anything else. Your mental and physical health come above all else.

Popularity isn't worth it. I've been out of high school for a while and do you know how many people from high school I've talked to since then? Four. And they were my very best friends going through school. Make a few close friends and you're guaranteed to have them for a long time.

Make good judgments. Don't let any peers pressure you into doing anything you don't want to. High school isn't quite like what you've seen in TV and movies, but the pressure to fit in is still there.

But at the same time, if you want to dress all pretty and wear makeup and heels, do it. Your choices are your choices and no one else's.

I went to a high school with a serious college crunch and there was a lot of shaming of those who either went to community college or didn't go to college at all. And that's bullshit. College is your choice. Maybe you have a career path that doesn't need college. But if you want to go to college, then go.

Best of luck, OP. It's only four years and you can make it.
