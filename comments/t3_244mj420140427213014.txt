I keep hearing ads for egg donors in my area, it sounds like something I should be able to do and I would probably qualify for. I like the idea of helping someone have a child that they want and would care for. I have a few mixed feelings about my genes running around or rather, I'm not sure how my family would feel about it.
I guess my biggest concern would be how it effects your chances of having children? Is there any increased risk of problems in the future? Also were all your medications injected or did you take pills as well? And lastly, how long was the surgery?
