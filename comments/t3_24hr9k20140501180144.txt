Your list is very helpful, is totally advice I would give to someone who's struggling to meet new people and develop friendships. 

Unfortunately for me, I already do all those and they are not helping. I'm sorry if that comes off as kind of bitchy... I guess I just feel like I'm reaching the end of my rope. I feel like I'm doing everything I can, but just am hitting failure/disappointment after failure/disappointment. I shouldn't think of them as failures, but it's hard not to when you continually put yourself out there and just not getting the results you want. I'm honestly getting to the point where I feel like I'm broken... and should just get used to the hermit-y/loner lifestyle. Which is why I posted specifically asking for ways to deal when you're alone versus how to meet new people/friends. 

> Start suggesting activities for the friends you already have. Your friends may like to do things you don't but why don't you either suggest things you like first or counter suggest.

I do... but no one wants to stay in on a Saturday night. They all want to go out and try new bars or go out dancing. Game nights or more chill nights in tend to happen more on Fri and Sun, and I'm totally on board with that and am one of the first to say I'm totally down. When I try and reach out to my (one) other friend who also isn't into the bar/club scene... more often than not I'm rejected because she's even more of a loner/hermit than me. (Although, I'm starting to get the feeling that she also doesn't really make me a priority either, which stings.)
