There was quite a debate a year or so ago about fashion appropriating cultural fashions and making them mainstream (for white people) and whether or not it was OK. Like, just because someone wears a native headress for Vogue doesn't mean it was OK then, and it doesn't mean that dressing up as natives for Columbus day isn't insulting.
