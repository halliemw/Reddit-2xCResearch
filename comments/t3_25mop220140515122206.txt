I think a lot of men suffer from symptoms like this. we are a generation of men being raised by our mothers to believe in ourselves and that we can achieve whatever we want as long as we do our due diligence. 

unfortunately, the world doesn't work that way and it's incredibly difficult for some of is men to cope with that. I often feel powerless in situations where I am working my ass off but don't seem to be going anywhere, I think the term is called "running backwards." 

the problem about this is that, at least for myself, I spend a lot of time in my own head. when left to my own devices, I can convince myself of anything and I too will burst into these weird incoherent confessing modes or just mindless rambles. we're not losing our minds but just trying to manifest and sort out some of the bullshit.

my wonderful gf has been infinitely patient with me in these times as I have been patient with her in her times of need. I find that this is the best medicine. a person that is there to not just listen to your shit but truly invest in your well being. listen to themes that may stress him out and perhaps work with him about them in a casual, no pressure situation. no one wants to feel like 'a project' or that they are deficient in anyway but if you guys can find ways to work through the small things, the bigger ones won't be as daunting
