I am 25, and felt exactly the same way when my bf of 4 yrs broke up with me a few years ago. It's normal to feel this way. 
They say it takes half as long as the relationship was to get over an ex, and I gotta say that was pretty true for me. 3 years later and I occasionally still think of him and feel sad but man has my life changed. I grew a LOT, emotionally, between 22 and 25. I'd say take this time to get to know yourself and work on your independence and self confidence. You're young, and you will find someone AMAZING again.
