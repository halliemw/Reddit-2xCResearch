I am comparing myself *trimmed* though. It's the density of hair... my follicles are very close together and my hair is very dark and coarse. Even when it is 1 mm long it can't hide the fact that I have lots of hair... Kind of like imagine a dense coarse beard shadow, not sure how to explain that. 

The only way you won't notice is if I wax, and that smooth look lasts max 3 days.
