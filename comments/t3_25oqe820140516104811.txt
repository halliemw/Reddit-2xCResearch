I was 13 when I was raped by two cousins of my best friend.  (Both were adults.)  I didn't report it because I was drugged and didn't fully understand what had happened.  I'd stupidly accepted beer from them (the four of us split a six pack), and I realized much later that I'd been drugged.  I got really impaired, and it didn't dawn on me until much later that you don't get drunk on one or two beers.  (I'd had very little experience with alcohol at that point, but I made up for it later.)

I didn't tell my mother until I realized I was pregnant.  She didn't believe that I was raped.  I was a virgin, but I had fooled around some with my boyfriend, so she just figured I was lying.  

TL;DR: If my own mother won't believe me, why would I tell the police?
