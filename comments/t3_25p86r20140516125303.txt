I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the responses, but holy cow. 

Does this subreddit go out of it's way to not be fun at all? Like, the major crime here is friends taking pictures of their passed out friends. Everyone does this to everyone, and has a laugh about it. If you're so serious that you can't laugh at yourself being passed out at your own party, then you probably don't have many friends to party with. 

You stand by what you did as if you stop a homicide. God forbid someone have a passed out photo on the internet. I can understand dying on a hill for stopping a potential crime, or violation, but this is neither of those things. This is literally, in every sense of the word, harmless fun. And you "berated" them? Holy cow, someone call the fun police. It wasn't just like a calm, "hey, don't take anything too embarrassing, hey?", but you literally berated them?!

Everyone here is so hyper sensitive to... well, anything it seems. Everyone I know has had their photo taken while they've been passed out, they've been drawn on. This is what real friends do to each other. Take a chill pill people, seriously.
