Sorry you had that experience. I had to get it last weekend and go through the same awkwardness of asking a male worker that I needed the pharmacist to get it and then got asked to wait in the "waiting chair of shame" for like 15 minutes. Like, I feel very strongly that I had no reason to be shameful about having to ask for it but I was still reluctant to shout it from the rooftops, in a crowded chemist, to some random guy who isn't even the chemist.

However, I will say, when I did see her, the pharmacist was so brilliantly blas√© about it. I know this might not be the experience everyone would want but, having moved to the UK from Ireland - I really appreciated her (almost) apathy. I expected the shame inducing "you silly girl" questions and attitude but instead it was like "look, here's the solution to a problem you have, I care more about the associated paperwork". It was also free - a welcome surprise!
