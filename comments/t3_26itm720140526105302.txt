Certain BC pills and methods like the arm implant and IUDs are such a constant stream of hormones that your period could lighten or stop altogether. A lot of women take these methods specifically because of that. It's nothing to be alarmed by unless you're experiencing other medical problems alongside it. 

You can stop having a period and be just fine, your uterus just stopped shedding it's lining. The way hormonal BC works is by tricking your body into thinking it's already pregnant. There's no need to build or shed your uterine lining if you're pregnant. 

If this bothers you though and you need that peace of mind that you're not actually pregnant then there are other methods available, or you can simply take a pregnancy test every month.
