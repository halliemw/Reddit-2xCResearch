Access to healthcare has long been a political issue in the UK for example flip flopping on the prescription charge through out history and now only certain English people have to pay it and that is much less controversial than abortion. Just because healthcare shouldn't be a political issue doesn't mean that it isn't. I completely agree that there should be free, safe abortions for northern Irish women, however I think the laws have to come from the northern Irish people.
