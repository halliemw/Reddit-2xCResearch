Wow! I'm truly sorry that something so awful happened to you, but I am so glad that you were given the justice and closure you deserve. That is really fantastic. Congratulations!

Now if only the conviction of rapists was so commonplace that we didn't feel the need to congratulate a survivor on receiving justice. Or better yet, if rape was so uncommon that this kind of thread was shocking for the violence it entailed, rather than the good news.
