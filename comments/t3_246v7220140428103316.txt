First and foremost: you need to have a rational, adult *conversation* about these issues. If he can't not get upset, if it can't not turn into a fight, maybe write it all down in a letter or email, make him sit down and read it, then try to initiate the rational, adult conversation that absolutely has to happen. 

Since you are married to him, I would assume that you can talk with him about everything else. You should be able to talk with your SO about everything, otherwise resentment will set in and bigger problems will follow. 

Just my two cents. Whether you take it or not, I send you hugs and hope things work out for you.
