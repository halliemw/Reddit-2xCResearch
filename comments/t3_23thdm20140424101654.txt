Nope. Its not bad nor really uncaring. I'm sure he cares for you unless there is more to it. . I've lost my father and both sets of grandparents. My husband parents both passed and I took off work. That doesn't mean I don't care or very much love my husband any less.
Your partner Taking off work should not bother you.
