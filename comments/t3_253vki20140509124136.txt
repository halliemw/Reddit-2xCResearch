the best way to compliment someone if you're worried about stepping on toes is to make it quick and not act like you're owed a follow up. an "omg that hat is FANTASTIC" while you're walking past someone is great. 

also, if the guy is, um, flouncy enough to set off my gaydar i pretty much treat compliments or conversations the same way i would if i were getting it from a straight woman. i was at a nude beach last week and ended up getting into a naked conversation with 4 naked gay dudes that never felt creepy at all even though they complimented my appearance.
