Whowha. Calm down. As I stated this only applied to my country. Multiple studies have been done on this subject in my country and somehow the women in this country don't want to work as much as other women in other countries.

Is that a bad thing? Nope, however they must accept the fact that a part time job pays less then a full time one. That's true for all genders and races.
