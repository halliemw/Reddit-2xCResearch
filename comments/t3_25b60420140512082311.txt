Where am I being disdainful?  Honestly point it out because I'd like to correct it.

And I'm not really trying to do anything more than toss around an idea.  I would say that, yes, honestly, in western society a "thin" female body is fairly universally positive.  I mean, say that being fat had no negative health repercussions but all the stigma still attached.  Would anyone want to be fat?  Probably not.

When a woman of color says "Ugh, stupid white girls," she's expressing exasperation at women who feel they can understand her while they still experience plenty of privileges she doesn't.  This makes white girls particularly defensive and there's talk about how "white girls have it hard too."  Just like when women talk about sexism many men respond with "Not all men" and "us too."

I'd say being a women means having your body picked on and dissected, becoming an object and not a subject.  Never feeling good enough.  However, a fat woman has a different experience with a new layer of oppression layered on.  She's objectified like a woman but also experiences a new kind of hate.  Intersectional layers.  That's why we have words like fat-shaming and thin privilege.  Thin women are the "default" and fat women the disgusting "other."

I don't know, I'm just throwing out ideas.  I'm trying to examine privilege from body-size perspective, much like you would gender, sexuality and race.  They're all different but similar.  All "minorities" in these groups experience discrimination, I'm just saying they overlap and it's interesting to look at how they intersect.

I feel like many "thin" women feel like they might not be taken seriously if fat girls are getting the attention of the body positive movement.  I dunno.

Edit: Spelling.
