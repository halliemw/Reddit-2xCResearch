Your life is your own.  It is yours, and no one else's.  If you let the fear rule you they win.  All the protests, all the shame from society, all the negativity about how you CHOOSE to life YOUR LIFE...if you give in to them, they've won the battle, and the war against women goes on.  

Whatever is right for you is right for YOU and YOUR SITUATION, universe be damned.  I support you 100%.
