If you use tampons, don't get the scented ones. They can cause irritation and discomfort, and they aren't all that good for you. 

You've probably already done this, but just in case make a note of when your period started on a calendar or something you will see everyday and keep track of it. That way it won't take you by surprise, and you will be prepared for it the next time. :)
