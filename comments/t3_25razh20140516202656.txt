I guess I do need to talk with him. I've talked to him about it before but in that instance I was just being irrationally jealous.
What made this relevant for me again was that the other night we were all going to a friends house to hang out. But he said he would only go if this girl went. He doesn't drink and neither does she and he said that he wanted someone to talk to if everyone was going to be drinking. He could tell I was mad about that and accused me of being jealous but it truly wasn't that AT ALL. 
But still communicate communicate communicate. Got it :) thanks for the advice!
