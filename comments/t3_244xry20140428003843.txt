Yup, absolutely agree. This should get companies thinking, marketing should show reality. I would actually purchase something even though I hate AE, darnit! This woman looks like me. Pretty close to my body type now since I've gained, and she's gorgeous! 

Just curious, does any one know if American Apparel touches up their photos? They also use more "realistic" models.
