You're right, there's no "right" way to feel. It's difficult to know how to react with someone who doesn't understand what they're doing, but we still have a right to request that it stops.

Sorry for off topic, but regarding UKIP, according to the BBC they have 134 seats (up 132) but labour has 1268 seats (up 206). I know UKIP are getting the publicity because they have changed a lot percentage wise, but it's still worth remembering they are a distant 4th behind the others. I'm pleased to see the Green's are gaining though.
