I can't find anything. That's what's making me sick. I can't find a single thing any of us over here can do except keep talking about it, keep bringing it up, keep remembering and lighting candles and making sure they're not forgotten. 

Not forgetting them is all we can do - I've seriously considered flying over there but what then? Stand there in front of some government office and glare? Pick up a gun and go into the woods and what, get myself killed by a spider because I'm a moron? 

So I posted this here so maybe someone else would see it and remember the girls and think about them and acknowledge that a lot of what we talk about here applies to these kids. 

If they come back, if they get any of them back, I'm going to try and find some way to send money over there, see if I can help the girls get counseling, more education. Half as a big old fuck you to the guys who kidnapped them and half as a way to try and help the girls.
