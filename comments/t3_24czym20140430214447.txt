Coming from someone who can't fathom leaving the house without foundation due to (what are objectively probably minor, but seem huge to me) acne scars, it is always nice to hear things like this. 

My roommate is the only one who sees me regularly without it and she often tells me she can't tell whether I'm wearing makeup or not which is always great to hear.
