Polgara! Was thinking about her yesterday. I didn't really like her as a kid, I found her kind of... condescending, maybe? She has so rigid and humorless, especially compared with her father. But then as an adult I realized she was thousands of years old and the most powerful woman in the world and yeah, everyone around her DID seem like children to her. I imagine myself in her place and I would have been way more of an intolerant rager. Everything she did was out of love. She's an extraordinary person.

Sassinak is awesome, I can't remember Killashandra Ree (feel like I should, though!). McCaffrey had awesome female characters in general, I feel like I could just list out like 6 of them. My personal favorite is Menolly, I loved that she wasn't a fighter, but she was so emotionally strong and sacrificed everything she had rather than compromise on her dreams.
