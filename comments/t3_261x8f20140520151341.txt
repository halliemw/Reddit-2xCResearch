Yep, I expected #4 to be seen as problematic. Ah well, nothing is perfect. You're absolutely right, a negative or painful after-experience is not universal for every woman.

Pregnancy centers are loosely defined. There is one in my area that is wonderful-- it's run by a faith based group, but they give free prenatal care, ultrasounds, and counseling to women who need it. They do inform women about abortion, even though they don't offer it at their facility. But I know many pregnancy centers are not so thorough as to offer actual care, and can be downright manipulative as well. I wish the term was better regulated... Similar to how the word "Realtor" can only be used by licensed Realtors, maybe "pregnancy centers" could be evaluated and given the title only if they're up-front and not manipulative of women.
