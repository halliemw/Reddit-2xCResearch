I see it too and it's disgusting. I recently met a woman who thinks the ultimate diss to her sister is to say, "Well at least I've never slept with a black guy!!"    
     
Her telling me that was a huuuge WTF moment for me. I hadn't been around this kind of thinking since I left Texas (where I often heard white guys saying they would never date any girl who had ever slept with black guys). But it exists - and not just in the south.
