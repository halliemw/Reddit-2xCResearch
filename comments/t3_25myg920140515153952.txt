I also have a medical condition  which pregnancy worsens, and some women have claimed birth control has worsened their conditon, while others claim they didn't notice a change. I have neurofibromatosis type 1. I have had doctors tell me to stay the hell away from estrogen that is in b/c, while others have told me its perfectly fine. This is another reason why I am so afraid of horomonal birth control. I don't want to give myself more tumours (not cancer, NF1 causes growths to grow on the nerves, they are non cancerous, but cause pain and discomfort)
