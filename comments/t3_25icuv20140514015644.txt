Do you not understand that psychologically "freezing up" is not a choice? Studies have been done on this and some people simply CANNOT deal with an assault. 

This has nothing to do with choosing to "go with it". Would you say such a disgusting thing to a rape victim who also "froze" and became non responsive while she was assaulted? Because this a completely natural and hard to fight reaction. 

You should realize that your life experience does not dictate what is normal or natural. By far most studies show people with freeze up or atart crying and freaking out in a crisis. See videos of tragedies and many peopke go wide eyed and stand while a gunman shoots across a room. Who are you to call them cowards or that they chose to act this way.
