I work at an ER and I can tell you the people who came in after a fight were usually big scary looking dudes. I guess people think it's ok to punch them but usually leave smaller or less imposing people alone. People are usually not attacked without some provocation as well. If you're polite and not too provocative I think you don't have to worry much and there is a huge stigma against attacking girls, especially little ones (These guys have kind of a code). 
In my experience people brawl to look strong and macho and that doesn't happen if your opponent is a little girl.
