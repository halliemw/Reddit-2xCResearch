Nah, when I went out with my skinny, 5'5 boyfriend (or even when I go out with him now as a friend), no problems. He couldn't beat the ass of a child, he weighs less than I do! Lifts less, too, given his recent health problems. Doesn't matter, still a magic harassment cure when I go out with him. Ownership seems far more plausible, unless everyone who *would* have otherwise hit on me when I'm with him was somehow smaller than 5'5, 120lbs.
