There's a guy at my work who says this to me all the time (and all the other women), and I just tell him, "Nope." He's a nice older guy and I think he wants us to smile because he wants us to be happy, but it gets really irritating all the damn time! Like, I don't want to have a stupid grin on my face every time you look over here just to assure you that I'm in a good mood today, alright?
