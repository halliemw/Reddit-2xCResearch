Have you taken a Meyer Briggs personality test?  I had a relationship that needed work, and I know what personality type I was and he was, then read up a bit on the best ways to communicate between those types.  It is not a magic bullet, but it helped. 

I get anxiety too, but I find understanding myself, what I feel comfortable with, what sets me off,  what I can expect, gives me more control.
