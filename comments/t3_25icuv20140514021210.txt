To be honest, my friends didn't tell me exactly what I did in graphic detail -- just that I was trying to make out with him. I don't know how far I went. He had a girlfriend (who was not present, but who I was aware of, and I respected their relationship when I wasn't blackout drunk) and therefore stopped me. I've done some wildly inappropriate stuff whilst blacked out drunk and probably could've gotten criminal charges for a lot of it. Thankfully, I don't drink these days ;) 

Like I said, alcohol doesn't excuse this dude's behaviour. But OP needs to find out just how far gone he was in order to know how to proceed. If he was just tipsy/drunk-ish, and had awareness of what he was doing, then that's fucked up and he should be avoided. If he was blacked out to the point that he doesn't remember what went on himself, then maybe he needs someone to tell him to lay off the sauce or find an AA meeting -- for his own sake and the sake of those around him.
