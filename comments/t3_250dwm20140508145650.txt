You can do it! Get some takeout from a restaurant you like but he doesn't, watch movies that you love and he doesn't, and listen to Destiny's Child like there's no tomorrow (you know, if you like Destiny's Child...)!

But seriously, focus on how much better your life will be without having to depend on someone you can't trust. You are worth so much more than that.
