Kind of confused...

* Your SO's phone was stolen.
* Someone took the phone home.
* That someone's SO saw naked pictures on your SOs phone.

This is where I'm confused...

* Lady posts your naked picture's to her SOs FB account? or your husbands?

* One way makes it sound as though she posted to the stealer's facebook account--and if that's the case, you're FB friends with them (I doubt this is the case, but that's how I initially read it).
* If she posted your photos to your husbands facebook account then it seems as though your husband and they guy have the same phone and she didn't even realize and started posting all your photos to your husbands page.  

**But** you also said, 
> *"And maybe the new owner was cheating because there were pictures of other women as well."* 

How do you know this?  If this were the case, wouldn't it be your husband's phone? If you're saying your pictures were posted to your husband's facebook by this girl, and that there were other pictures of women on there...it would be your husbands phone, right? Are they pictures on your husband's phone that you know about?

Again, not saying your husband has photos of other women, but that part of the post is very confusing and she wouldn't have access to your husbands profile from her SOs page...I hope you can find your husband's phone...

I would suggest changing his password and removing the photos if you haven't done so already. maybe even sending an email to an address linked to that phone to try and get it back. Maybe he picked it up accidentally.
