They're getting a lot better with doing simultaneous or relatively consecutive resection/reconstruction nowadays. Hopefully it will just become a thing of the past that woman even need to think about any kind of accommodation.

Obviously it's not 100% perfect but you wouldn't be able to tell unless you saw the nipple anyway. The only issue I've heard with the SGAP flap reconstructions is that because the fat is from your butt/stomach, it puts on weight differently than normal breast tissue does, so you have to watch your weight or you end up lop-sided.
