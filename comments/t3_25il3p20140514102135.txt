If you're in college, I'm assuming you have a student health center. I'm not sure how common it is, but my student health center had a very good program for getting people birth control, especially the pill. They also had their own women's health clinic (which is where I went for gyno). Also, since I was on the student health insurance plan, my birth control pills were actually no charge -they covered them completely. You should go to your student health center and research your options there. Even if it isn't free, on insurance bc is pretty cheap. IUD's are often not cheap unfortunately and the procedure to get it done may result in the insurance company sending a notice to the policy holder. Regular medications do not as far as I know. Your insurance company should not disclose the exact medication you are taking, but I'm not completely sure, so I would talk to the doctor about it.
