I had the same problem in HS, I was so self conscious about my periods it would mess with my social life. I started the pill and was never happier. I am 26 now and am just now thinking about an IUD. It sucks to remember the pill every day but I think it is probably the best place for you to start? Don't do the patch. It is awful.
