I am sorry for your health problems...yikes, my heart goes out to you.  However, it bothers me greatly that having a period should be so humiliating for you.  It is normal and healthy, and people working in medical fields should know all about them.  Nurses see so much in their line of work, some seriously gross stuff, a young woman messing the bed with a heavy period should not bother them a bit.  It is not like you deliberately made a mess, you can not help when your period arrives, and it sounds like you have plenty of problems you were dealing with.  Your father's reaction seemed a bit, well, off, to me...why should seeing his ill daughter's period blood make him turn pale?  If a man can live with a woman, get her pregnant, deal with her giving birth, and so on, well, he should be a bit knowledgeable of and sympathetic with menstruation.  Women have periods.  Between menarche and menopause women have over 400 periods.  That is way too common an occurrence in one's life to get humiliated over.  Also, you describe brusque treatment by the nurse and tech...try to let them know they made you feel uncomfortable.  What is routine for them is not routine for you, and doors should be closed and curtains pulled when dealing with such issues.  If you can speak up for yourself, it may help them be better, more caring with all their patients.  Best of luck to you.
