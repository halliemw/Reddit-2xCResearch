The placebo pills are literally all the same and have zero hormones, and since your pills are all the same color you probably have a monophasic pill so they're all the same, too. You are not even a little bit at risk of pregnancy for taking pills in the same row in the wrong order, and you didn't need Plan B but it shouldn't hurt anything. If you have any confusion or you don't trust me, talk to your pharmacist. That's what they're there for, and they're very knowledgable. It sounds like you don't entirely understand your pill, so I think you really need to have a good talk with your doctor or pharmacist to make sure you completely understand what's going on and how to handle little hiccups in your birth control usage.
