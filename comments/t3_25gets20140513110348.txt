Mine isn't really *soft* per say. But body hair I do have. I only shave the beard because that weirds people out and they react loudly/aggressively/rudely and I just don't have time for that shit. Everything else though is wild and free. Legs, arms, belly, mons, armpits, you name it I got it covered in hair. I don't really need anyone to cherish me, I do just wish people would keep it to themselves if they don't like it. There's only so many times I can be called "Beast" and not put a boot up someone's ass.
