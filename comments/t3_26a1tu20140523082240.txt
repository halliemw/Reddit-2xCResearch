I gave my sister an all in one pepper spray/taser/alarm+siren. I think you could probably procure a siren, it flashes and lights up and has a whistle so you can be seen and heard from far away. You also could contact the local police force and make sure they are patrolling the areas you walk at night frequently. 

Walk like a powerful person, don't walk meekly. Wear your hair up tight, and keep your wits about ya
