It's not you, it's the terrible people who treat you without the dignity every human being deserves. It can also be very hard to deal with this problem when people in your support group (bf, family, friends) are brushing off your experiences because it didn't happen to them--that sucks!

Even though you have had a rough time finding a good therapist, I hope you do keep trying or at least find someone who is willing to offer a listening ear. Good luck! Honestly, there's nothing you can do to make terrible people not-terrible.
