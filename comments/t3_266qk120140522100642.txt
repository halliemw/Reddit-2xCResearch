I am surprised by this reaction, the /menrights subreddit was far more in favor of her defense.

As for my favorite Mn Supreme justice Alan Page:

"
Among the dissenters was Justice Alan Page, who wrote that the court had in essence concluded that losing the privilege to drive is a small price to pay for saving one’s life. In doing so, it failed to adhere to case law and “the constitutional mandate to do justice,” he wrote.

The court’s decision implies “that the necessity defense is unavailable not only in cases of domestic abuse, but also in cases in which a victim’s seeking refuge from a violent physical or sexual assault or kidnapping, and the court’s decision thus discourages those individuals from seeking shelter in a motor vehicle as well,” Page wrote."

Women do judge other women harshly and hold some very questionable double standards if their own. Women might be their own worst enemy.
