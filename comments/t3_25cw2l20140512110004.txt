i could NOT agree more. the sort of person who is able to treat others as disposably as your ex has done have no idea what anguish they leave in their wake.  
you owe **nothing** to this girl, or any future conquest of his. it just isn't your place to warn them, and anyway most would only mock or resent you for any attempts. (imagine if an ex of his had tried to talk you out of things in the beginning. no point, no point at all.)  
you are rid of his issues. **let yourself be rid of them.** there are great men who will offer you all the wonderful things you thought you had, plus more, and none of the pain. take what lessons you can from the pain, let it run its course, and seek out ways to feel good about living your life. the best advice i got in a similar situation was to give yourself things to look forward to. you deserve the happiness you're craving.
