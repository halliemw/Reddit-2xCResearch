Anytime! I research obesity, and our journal club this semester was focused on failed obesity drugs, so I'm really familiar with what's approved on the market. There are a lot of unapproved supplements, and I would be incredibly cautious about taking them. If she wants a reasonable dose of an appetite suppressant, she could consider drinking a cup of coffee or tea if she feels like snacking. Caffeine is an appetite suppressant, and the water will help her feel full. That's a habit sort of thing that she could continue long-term, so it's a sustainable lifestyle change rather than a quick fix. As long as she's not drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee, she'll be alright.

Also, if there's anything she wants specifically, I'd be happy to look up studies on it and give you guys a copy or a summary of whatever I find, or both. I enjoy getting into the research and reading more anyway, so just PM me if she's set on something and I can look through PubMed for you and give you both the data she needs to make healthy decisions for herself.
