My husband is in the military, I get ma'amed every day (**erry damn day!**).  It used to annoy me (I'm from New England, we don't use ma'am), but now I let it go. It's part of the culture to use Sir & Ma'am, and many of the guys saying it are doing so out of respect. It only bothers me when my husband says "yes ma'am!" when I ask him to do something simple like put his dishes in the sink. But he knows that, and does it on purpose. *Grrr....*
