I haven't been on the other side of it, and both situations have uniquely horrible aspects, but I would have to agree with you. It is very difficult, especially as it's gotten harder and harder to remember her before all of this happened. It's also so much worse for her. She doesn't understand that she's sick anymore, but when she did have some idea of what was going on....I would be lying if I said I never wished it had just ended suddenly. She deserved so, so much better than this. 

She was a treasure. Thank you for your truly kind words
