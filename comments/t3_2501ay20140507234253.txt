Yes! As an added note, I would think about meeting this guy in a place that's safe and easy to leave, as well as using the buddy system. I'm not saying its a guarantee that this guy will attack you, but it's also helpful in awkward situations to be able to easily leave. I'd go for a semi-public place like a secluded corner of a park, cafe, or right outside where you live. A public place may seem like a bad place for a private conversation, but they are easy to escape, they keep reactions in check (less likely to react too emotionally in public), and you can have friends nearby for moral support, witnessing, everything. 

Whatever you do, I would NOT meet him at his place. If you gotta meet somewhere private, do it at your friend's space (buddy system!) or your place. I'm speaking from experience. When you meet someone at their home, they can have a bit of a social upper hand. If things get awkward, or dangerous, then the onus is on you to leave. And you are likely to be less comfortable in a place that doesn't belong to you. You deserve to feel safe and comfortable while having this conversation, okay? I hope it goes well.
