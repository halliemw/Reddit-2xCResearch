I get rid of my body hair, but it's not to avoid the stigma (well, mostly, though I get so much shit for lack of femininity in other areas that it's nice to not worry about this one) or because I'm ashamed of it. My hair is dark and coarse and my skin is light and soft. I love, love, love the way my skin feels, and I can't feel it when there's hair in the way; also, it's more aesthetically pleasing to me to not have my pale skin broken up by dark hairs or red ingrown dots. I would love to permanently remove my leg/stomach/arm/pit hair and the edges of my bikini area. I do like my bush though, mostly because I can make fun designs in it, haha.

But that's a me thing. I had a boyfriend who removed his body hair for the same reasons, and I have a couple of lady friends who choose to keep their body hair. And you know what? Those are both great fucking choices. Rock your body however you want, because it's the confidence that's sexy! 

I'm such a staunch feminist that sometimes I feel bad about not pushing this boundary, but my comfort is more important to me than this one thing. For anyone else, though, screw the naysayers and proudly show off your body hair :)
