The police do require evidence in order to back up your claim. I've gone through something similar and it sucks to have to keep every bit of contact when all you want to do is delete it and get this guys presence out of your life. 

If you've deleted everything now, just decide if you want to go to police that you will keep everything from now onwards. You can still make a statement I believe, but it just won't carry the same weight without evidence.
