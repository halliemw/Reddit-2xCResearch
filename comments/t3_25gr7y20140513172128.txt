Ah, that's the word. But even the recommendations for that have changed recently, I believe. I got an abnormal, went through a year of normal pap smears, and have now been told that I don't need to get another one in another 3 years. I believe it might also be the case that the recommendation for follow-ups to abnormal pap smears changed from 3 months to 6 or a year or something.

Regardless, her next pap results will MOST LIKELY come up normal, a good doctor would reassure her regarding what the test actually means, and all of this would take a huge weight off her mind.
