Bryan sounds like a narcissist, and if he really is one, the best, and I mean TRULY BEST thing to do is to cut him from your life entirely, never speak to him about anything, ever, and do your best to forget his existence.

Let go of the feelings he caused with his paternal behavior. It was all illusion, if he is a true narcissist. There was never anything in his heart for you. I know this is cruel and harsh, but people like him have something broken in their personality that can't be fixed by anything you do (or don't do). It wasn't your or your Mom's fault, and he will continue to manipulate and victimize you if you allow him to.

There are community options for people in your housing situation in most places. Google "housing assistance" for your area. Best wishes. I am sorry for your situation.
