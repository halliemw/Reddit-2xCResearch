Go for the new job. Don't tell your boss, or any of your coworkers ANYTHING until you have actually signed a contract for the new job. The you give them your two weeks notice- NOT A MOMENT BEFORE YOU HAVE SIGNED THE CONTRACT. I seriously cannot emphasise that enough. 

Sounds like your current workplace just generally has a shitty environment, culture and management structure. You can't fix that, so just get out as soon as you can and try to stay on good terms with everyone so you can get a good reference.
