Just because someone makes a joke that doesn't make them funny, and someone who uses the "i'm just joking" excuse is really just looking for a blanket excuse to invalidate anything anybody has to say about their behavior.

Why is harassment unacceptable?  Because it makes the victims of it uncomfortable.  Point blank.  Deliberately doing things that are established to be making people uncomfortable is unacceptable, and to argue that this isn't true because what you are doing is a joke is to say that your desire to be funny is more important than other peoples' experiences at their workplace.  This isn't true.
