First, figure out what sort of external stimulus works to get you in the mood. Maybe it's erotic fiction, maybe it's regular old porn, maybe it's softcore still pictures, maybe it's detailed remembrances of past experiences. Whatever, just begin by getting your mind along for the ride.

Science fact- it's harder to feel disgusted when you're horny. I also think it's harder to feel embarrassed or anxious. So start by getting horny.

Get yourself a nice little unintimidating vibrator. (You can always pick up a hitachi later if you like it.) Go for one that advertises a lower frequency 'thrum' rather than 'buzz' if you can. At the moment, you're looking for an exterior-play toy, (not shaped like a penis, because it's not meant to be inside you) so you don't need to worry about a flared base or anything like that, but you should still look for something phthalate free.

Take your laptop to bed. Look/read stuff to get you in the mood. At some point, try out the vibrator in the vicinity of your clit (not right on it to start- you'll want to get the lay of the land first) and try to just keep that feeling good while your mind is still engaged in whatever it is you like. Don't rush. And don't be disappointed if all you get out of it is good feelings the first time, it may take a little practice to get an actual orgasm.

Lastly, I just want to say that I am all for ladies masturbating. It's so much easier to be clearheaded and relaxed when you can take care of yourself.
