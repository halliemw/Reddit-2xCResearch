Maybe I'm just projecting too much; but to me, not wanting to show her his phone is equally consistent with being very (hypocritically) sensitive to his boundaries as it is with duplicity.

As for sociopathy, perhaps I chose a poor word; since this might make it seem like I'm trying to cast some people in a histrionic light. So outlawing the word and discussing in meaning: I still think too many people in this thread are immediately jumping to the conclusion that he is a dyed in the wool creep, who had in mind that this was an immoral intrusion on OP's rights, rather than just making thoughtless presumptions.

>In terms of considering his ignorance or giving him a break I believe this: An explanation for the behavior does not excuse what occurred or mean he has some right for her to repair the relationship.

I agree 100%. Which is why I endorsed /u/VGWritsealot's post. Short of something illegal (stealing his phone and hacking it, perhaps), the best way /u/throwawaygggf has of protecting her rights right now is having this recorded conversation with him. Actually, politely asking him to show her his phone would be good too. If he refuses, she has it on record that he refused. If he shows her, her anxiety is reduced by at least that much. As to the relationship... even if he wasn't being a creep, a guy being too dense about personal boundaries is reason enough to end things too.
