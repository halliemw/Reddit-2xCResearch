Even if one doesn't evaluate the moral right/wrong of the addition to the yearbook - being a teenage parent had nothing to do with school.  It wasn't like it was an extracurricular club or that they achieved a special award/honor.  I'm willing to bet the honors graduates didn't get a 2 page spread.

 These students graduated through a hardship.  Well that's nice and all, but was there a 2 page spread for students who were orphans?  Or significantly handicapped?  Or had parents serving overseas while they were in high school?  Those students dealt with hardships, too.   

There was really no good logical argument for its inclusion and the faculty member who oversaw the yearbook committee should have been able to explain to those students that wanted it in that it really wasn't appropriate for the yearbook.
