Rape... Not sure but there are definite elements of sexual abuse in there. It is sometimes easy for people to block things like this out until much later (I denied being sexually assaulted for five years). He didn't respect your consent and that is wrong, it is not your fault, it's his.

I'm sorry you had to deal with this, I am here if you need to talk it out, and I am sure others have offered as well. Sometimes the simple act of getting it off your chest will help you feel much better.
