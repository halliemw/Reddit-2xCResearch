Being alone can be very rewarding.  You get to do whatever you want to do, no questions asked, no judgements, no backlash.  It can be very freeing and satisfying.

For myself, I cook, I work out, I go for a bike ride, I binge on tv shows, I go shopping, I play with my cats, I read, talk to my parents, hang out with friends, play video games, go see a movie, go the theater, or a museum, take a walk, work on a project, or just hang out online and respond to questions like this.  It's not a matter of filing up time though.  All of it is stuff I want to do, and things I can do whenever I want, or not at all, if I'm just not feeling up to it that day.

It definitely gets easier over time.  Best of luck to you and I hope WH has a yummy dessert (they usually do... one of my favorite places to go grocery shopping.) :)
