The admins actually approach all subreddits before making them defaults. They have to say "Yes" to be come a default, or "No" if they don't want to. The the moderators of this subreddit explicitly gave permission to an admin when asked if they wanted to become a default subreddit. They could have said no, which is what /r/AskHistorians did when asked. IF they change their mind, they can be removed from the set of default subreddits.

I'm actually not exactly sure what that checkbox does. Maybe it prevents posts from being shown in /r/all?
