Thank you. I actually was very confident until multiple people in charge of my training, on separate occasions, made comments about my lack of confidence. My concern is that I'm giving a false impression that I am unsure of myself, which will cause people to question me. It wasn't a fluke that multiple people came to the same conclusion, and I am missing something in my presentation that shows I am ready to be in charge.

It's strange how confidence can be shaken just by people assuming you have none.
