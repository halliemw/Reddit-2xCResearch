I've had a few intense friendships with other girls/women.  One was with a girl in college who lived in the same dorm as me so we were basically up each others' asses 24/7 for like four years (metaphorically speaking, of course).  We graduated over ten years ago but when we see each other, which is not very often, it's like no time has passed at all.  

I'm trying to imagine how I would have felt if my college friend or one of the other girls I was that close with had tried to take the relationship somewhere sexual/romantic.  I don't think it would have been good.  As much as I loved them, I was not attracted to them in that way.  I think something like that would have resulted in me pulling away from them because I would feel like, I don't know, that my presence, or my affection would hurt them.  Like, me hugging them or touching them would just be a reminder of what they want and what I can't give them.    I think I would always be second guessing their emotions and it wouldn't be good for either of us.  

All that is to say that I think you might be a little infatuated at the moment so perhaps now is not a good time to act on your feelings.  Also, I wouldn't act on them at all unless you are 100% sure that she is open to a relationship with a woman.
