I was 5'9 by the age of 12. Sometimes it sucked a lot, as none of the boys had caught up and I towered above them. But as time goes on and they grow too I found that the only person worrying or obsessing over it was me, and everyone just slotted in to their natural places in life.

The only problems I've had as an adult was being told by some guy in a club that he wouldn't date a giraffe.
