Sometimes it's not you as your clothes who don't get cleaned properly and simply re-activate funk as soon as they get a bit damp from normal odourless sweat. 

Some thread types are also really bad at catching and holding on to odours ( unnatural ones like polyester mostly). Are you washing them often enough? If so, is it with a strong detergent or an organic one. Or maybe it's a liquid one i instead of powder ? Tried going the natural route and holy shit all of my clothes appeared clean but after a few hours they would stink like hobo sweat. After switching back to regular powder detergent it took a fee cycles of washes and now all my clothes smell fine.

How are you drying the clothes - drier? Hung on the rack? If clothes stay wet long or dry in a damp area where air isn't circulated they will develop a funk too or even mildew. A good way to get rid of it is to do a final rinse with a half cup vinegar. And to NEVER allow wet clothes to wait, not even minutes, before hanging.

And finally deodorant - same experience as with "natural" detergents. Some are not true deodorants (reduce sweat or bacteria) but simply smelly shit to mask sweat smell. These are absolutely awful. If you are particularly stressed your sweat will smell particularly bad so stick to hard regular deodorants and stay away from any mild/0% alchohol/organic bullshit. They just don't work on certain people.
