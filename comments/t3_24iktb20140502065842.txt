I love these.  You have a good eye!

I have a friend with an eye for the wonderfully horrible, or the horribly wonderful kitsch.  I have a wayward art project, which mainly focuses on bad homemade art, or commercial art made into new, even more awful art... but there is room in the world for the fascination of weirdness.   

Anti M's Home for Wayward Art... I don't have a site, but you can find images here and there online.
