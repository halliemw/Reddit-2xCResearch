You do know that hospitals are required to accept patients, no matter if they can or cannot pay, right? Aside from payment plans, some will completely wash the cost because the patient is unable to pay anything. 

Also, it's the fucking law. No hospital is going to say, sorry no we refuse to treat you because you have no money. Legally they cannot turn you or anyone away. 

So yeah, there are options out there and I'm tired of this subreddit and it's excuses when it comes to this subject. If the users here love their anecdotal diagnosis' so much then please do enjoy the inevitable, someone will give out bad advice here and someone's health will suffer because of it. 

If it hasn't already happened.
