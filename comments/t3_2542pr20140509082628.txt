Also a man. My perspective on the dick pics is that guys send them for the same reason they flash in the subway.  It's a kind of assault where they get off on the power they feel from making people react to it.  It's not the kind of thing that's meant to get a woman interested in you, it's to get the thrill of watching their disgust or to make them feel unsafe while the flasher/pic sender can feel secure in the reality that no one will do anything about it and they can usually remain anonymous.  It's harder for this behaviour to hold any reward if there are constant consequences to it.  These aren't guys who fantasize about their own humiliation, generally speaking, they don't normally get called out on it.  There are dozens if not hundreds of men who flash in public transit or parks in just the city of Toronto, and it's a rare thing to hear about any of them being arrested. Dick pics are even safer for the perpetrator since it's harder to get caught and embarrassed or charged.
