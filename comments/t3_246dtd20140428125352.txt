That is awful!! My week doesn't quite compare, but I'll give it a shot.  My first day back at school after coming home from my grandma's funeral, a professor disrespects me in class, in front of all the students: interrupting my comments with statements that (I later found out directly from him) he knew were false, and justifying genocide.  When I contacted him to explain why I was offended, he blamed me.  Then the guy I liked, had a bit of a thing with and though things were going well with decided to pull passive aggressive bullshit, not talking to me for two weeks, and then finally just says "Yeah, I'm busy, I'm not coming over in may." Yayyyyy
