This happened 5 years ago. I can thankfully(?) say that if you want to show me a picture displaying sexual violence, I can handle it. Again, AT THE TIME it was very difficult to not imagine the violence that occurred to my sister. I excused myself because my heart was racing, and I couldn't help but cry. If that makes 20 year old me a child, then whatever I guess you're right.

The whole point to my post isn't even really about trigger warnings. It is about people's reactions when these things are brought up. After posting to this  board, I received a PM saying that I deserve to be raped because I'm a piece of shit who can't handle the real world. I could seriously care less about trigger warnings at this point in my life. I just want to be able to talk about how sexual violence has affected my life and the life of my family without being called weak, stupid, or rape-worthy. Fuck!
