> It is gross and embarrassing.

All depends on context. The same way hitting on someone in a bar or a disco can be inappropriate. If you are oblivious to these social clues and unwritten rules, you are the problem, not the other way around. If you don't get a clue when it's not okay to hit on someone, you are the problem, but not knowing how to not take a compliment as an insult, or as *gross*, and just going on with your work, is an equally sample of social awkwardness. 

OP posted 2 examples. The first is definitely wrong, the second not, really, not. That's not harassment. It's not gross, and if it makes you awkward I'd work a bit on your self-esteem.
