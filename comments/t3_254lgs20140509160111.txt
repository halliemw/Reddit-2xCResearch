Some hair will come back after laser treatment, but it will always be lighter, finer and sparser than it was before.  I had it done on my bikini line, and I've been pretty happy with the results.  I've got extremely sensitive skin and even though I still have to do some hair removal down there, it no longer gets insanely irritated like it used to.
