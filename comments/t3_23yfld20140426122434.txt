I'm not sure if there is really a specific way to get involved with it, it seems like everyone I know who does restoration came into it a different way! I actually started by volunteering when I was 16 with my local historical society. I was really into archaeology and history at the time and it seemed like a great way to spend my summer. They had one woman, who later became my boss, who was working on restoring the town's oldest burying ground, investigating the stories of the people buried there, and offering historical tours of the cemetery, so I started helping her and got so involved that eventually she had to start paying me! :P

I'd suggest checking out [the association for gravestone studies] (https://www.gravestonestudies.org/) I was very involved with the group for a few years and the whole organisation is full of awesome and very knowledgeable people, lots of whom are interested in genealogy as well. They have been starting a lot of regional chapters, so if you are in the US check if there is one near you and see if you can go to some meetings. There is a membership fee for joining the organisation but as far as I know you can go and check out the chapter meetings without being a member.
