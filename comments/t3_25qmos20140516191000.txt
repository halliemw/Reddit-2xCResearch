It's a bit controversial but some hollistic doctors say that because some birth control stops the production of Estrogen and Progesterone it can cause a hormone imbalance, especially if you take it when your hormones are starting to 'develop'. It's a very controversial theory. I'm one of the lucky ones who has suffered from the hormone imbalance! I started the pill when I was about 14 because I suffered from heavy irregular periods but was taken off of it after about 8 months because they thought it was causing my migranes. A few years later I just got sick of all of the period dramas so I was referred to a gyno who trialed and errored a number of different pills and the depo which ultimately made soooo much worse, with me getting very heavy and painful periods every 2 weeks. After getting a few tests done It became apaprent that i was lacking progesterone so I was put on the Mirena. Fast forward to now after regular doctors visits and all my symptoms returning after being on the mirena for 3 years  I went and saw a hollistic doctor who was the first doctor who actually listened and it became apparant that my body was severly lacking in hormones, despite getting the progestin from the Mirena. So after all the drama that I went through after being on the pill/depo I agree with the hollistic doctors and their scepticism for synthetic hormones.
But if it works for you then definitely don't stop it :) If you're a bit scared then you could always be asked to be put on natural progesterone which is what I've just started taking today!
All the best!
