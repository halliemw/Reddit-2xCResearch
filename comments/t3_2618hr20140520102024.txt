I'm not an active member of this sub, but I have been watching it for a long time (long before it becoming a default.)

Those responses are not par for the course here. The mods try their hardest to make this a safe place, as do a lot of the members. But there are going to be people who don't like that women have a safe place on the internet. Please don't let those people stop you from participating in an awesome community.
