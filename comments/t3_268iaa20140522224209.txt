Xena, not because she's strong, but because she always does what's right.  She used to be bad, but she changed her ways and now she uses her "many skills" to fight for good people who don't have the same combative talent as her or her adversaries.  She is intelligent, compassionate, resourceful, and a good leader.  I would love to see young girls emulate her in character, even if they can't brawl.
