Liars and attention-seekers aside, a large majority of the commenting user-base on 2XC are still emphatically against it because of what it's done (and is still doing) to the community.

The admins and 2XC are in favour of it because having 2XC as a default makes women more visible on reddit and will hopefully help to rein in some of the childish teenage-boys-clubhouse attitude that largely prevails on the rest of reddit, even at the cost of 2XC as a good community for women to feel safe in.
