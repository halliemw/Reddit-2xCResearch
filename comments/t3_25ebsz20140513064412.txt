I'm in London and AHRC funded so my stipend works out as about £1300 a month, which is the equivalent of something like an £18-20k salary. Which isn't really all that bad. Given that I perceive my PhD to be indulgent I think that any money is generous! You certainly have to be frugal but it's doable. It depends on your earning potential outside of the PhD, I suppose. 

I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you don't have an end goal in mind, if you're basically just doing it to put off having to get a job for a few more years. Most early-career jobs just are unexciting, and you kind of have to put your time in to get somewhere more interesting.
