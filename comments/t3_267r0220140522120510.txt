I legit just hit my copay maximum of $1000 last month. I SPENT $1000 ON COPAYS IN A YEAR. I am too young to feel this old and shitty!

I'd love to work out in a pool but I am honestly broke. I make literally just enough to break even (and I had to buy a car this year so my savings took a serious hit) and all the gyms with pools in this area are in the $30-$40 a month range and I just can't afford it. Looking into seeing if there's any way I can get gym costs covered as a health expense. (I've had a nagging foot injury as well as a newly diagnosed back problem...so I'm going to touch base with my new orthopedist/my insurance company to see if this would be a possibility.)
