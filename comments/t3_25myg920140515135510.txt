I know BC works for a lot of people, unfortunately I'm not one! I was on BC for 8 months. My boobs actually got bigger, affected my sex drive hardcore (still not back), and made me generally unhappy/depressed. I LOVED how it helped my period - so that might be a good idea for you! - but now that I'm off of it (been off for...9 months now), my period is still not the same, I've actually only had about 3 over the last nine months. I also started getting cystic acne after I stopped, which I NEVER had a problem with before.

I know that there's many different kinds and clearly that one wasn't right for me, but I'm just afraid to try anything that affects my body so much -- especially for so long after I stopped taking it.

There's pros and cons, everyone's different, but there's my experience for ya!
