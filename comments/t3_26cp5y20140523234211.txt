Here's some tough love: The communication in your relationship is fucked. 

- You had unprotected sex with your SO of 4 years, and he didn't put on a condom. How is it 100% his responsibility to put on a condom? Right, he should have suggested it, or paid more attention, but YOU consented to it. Your SO may not be the brightest guy, or maybe was in the heat of the moment, or maybe he just doesn't care about the consequences of his actions. That doesn't matter.

Arguably, if keeping the hypothetical pregnancy is 100% your choice, then you are 100% responsible for enforcing the use of contraceptives. No excuses.

- You are posting publicly about a situation that you're not even sure you're in yet. Pregnancy tests cost as low as $1. *Get one.* Get several and keep them handy. They are highly accurate after being ~3 days late. In the future, I would recommend actually taking a damn test before getting into this fight with your SO. Take some time to breathe, and mull over your options in your head.

- Pregnant or not, you need talk to your significant other. About a *LOT.* Are you financially stable enough for a child? He may be coming off as insensitive, but his reasons for not wanting a child could be valid. Are you willing to raise a child alone? Are you willing to try other forms of birth control? Is he willing to be more attentive regarding the consequences of his actions? Are you willing to take responsibility for yours? You've been together for 4 years, I find it pretty unnerving that the only discussion regarding children was over a year ago, and you were in the same situation then.
