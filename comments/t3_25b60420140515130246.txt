Well, just playing devil's advocate here, since I don't know how I feel about breastfeeding in public yet...

> so by telling a mother she can't breast feed in public your telling her to not leave her house, because she won't be able to feed her baby while out

I don't think those two things are linked. It would be a good argument except there are places the woman could go to breastfeed (restrooms) while out and about that wouldn't rustle any feathers.

>Do you eat in public? cus that's literally the same thing. I'm sorry breasts are so offensive to you.

It isn't the same thing. Nourishing yourself with part of a another person's body (one that is taught from a young age is "private") isn't the same as nourishing yourself with food prepared on a plate. Just as running for exercise can't get you in the same trouble as running from the cops. :) Not to mention, there are many rules for public eating, too, that society expects you to follow. Not everything goes.
