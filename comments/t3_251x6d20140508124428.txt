Our company specifically doesn't allow spouses to be in positions where they could end up reporting to each other - even if they are 'equal' roles, just the potential to be promoted over each other is an issue. My husband and I work in the same company, and even on the same projects sometimes, but in completely separate departments.
The 'no spouses in the same chain of command' thing was implemented after too many incidences of couples being accused of helping each other with their work so that one or the other got better performance reviews (which leads to better salaries/better jobs).
Maybe your fianc√© just wants to avoid an perception of impropriety, since the company doesn't seem to have anything in place?
