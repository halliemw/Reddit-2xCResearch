Thanks for sharing! I'm pretty sure that our marriage will be very similar. He does not expect me to be with him every single time he sees them. I will probably only have to be around them on major holidays. I'm sure that not seeing them a few times a week will make them much more tolerable! Right now, I just see them wayyyy too often and it's overwhelming.
