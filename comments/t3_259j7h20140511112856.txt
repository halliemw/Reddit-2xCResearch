The worst experience with my hair happened in Seattle. 

I was attending the UW and lived off campus. I had a buzz cut, and so did my boyfriend at the time (his mother cut our hair, free haircuts are awesome!). We were walking back to my place to have dinner, we were holding hands and talking, I was wearing skinny jeans and a sweatshirt. Two young men in a truck were stopped as a light and as we walked by one of them hissed, "faggots." We continued walking past but they said it again louder, then louder again. After the third time I couldn't help it. I turned around and yelled back at them "I'M A GIRL!" Thankfully, the light changed and they drove off, I was worried about getting into a fight. 

That summer we drove from Seattle to Madison, WI. One fellow in Bozeman, MT asked us if we were dating and, after we said yes, chuckled and admitted that he thought we were brothers when he first saw us. In Hill City, SD, I got almost nothing but stares. I stopped at a mart to get tweezers and a trio of girls walked around the corner, made eye contact with me, and started giggling. It was strange.

Those experiences made me want to stop buzzing my hair, now it's a shaggy pixie most of the time.
