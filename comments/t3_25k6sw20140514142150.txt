>How do I make this happen in the nicest way possible? 



Most likely you can't.  Being "nice" will only give him the wrong signals.  That doesn't mean you have to be mean either, just be direct.  Tell him you're too busy right now for a new friendship and that you don't think of him in a romantic way, and that you need some space and you think it is better for the two of you to stop talking.  If he asks you to hangout after that, just remind him of what you said before and tell him directly that you don't think it is a good idea.  Be assertive, and don't fool yourself that this can be done without hurting him.  If he has developed feelings for you, it will hurt, there is no way around it.  But it is better to hurt him all at once by telling him the truth, than being too nice and have him interpret as you being a little interested, which will only make him pursue you further, which as a result will make you retract further, and hurt him (and you) more for a longer period of time.
