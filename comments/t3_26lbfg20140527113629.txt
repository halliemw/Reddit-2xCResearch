I'm in the same boat with you, and I told my current SO that some women just don't orgasm during vaginal intercourse and that I'm one of those women. I decided to tell him from the get-go simply because I had been in a LTR before where I faked every.single.orgasm. And that's no fun!

I also agree with not calling it "faking" as well, but you might also not lead on that this has been going on for so long. I know honesty is the best policy, however, you could try to avoid using any time frames just so it doesn't hurt his feelings that a) he was not pleasing you in the way that he thought and b) that it took you so long to tell him (which a lot of times we're afraid to tell our SO's about problems like this because we don't know they are so common).
