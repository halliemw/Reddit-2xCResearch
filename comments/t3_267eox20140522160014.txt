> It's really the first step toward true equality. As more women become interested in fields that were previously male-dominated, the gender gap for those fields will decrease naturally.

This is only if you assume that men and women are identical in all ways that could be relevant to any field, which isn't true. Many gender gaps have been erased completely and many other gender gaps have not budged at all, not because of discrimination and unequal opportunity but because men and women are statistically different. Here is an example:

So workshops targeted towards women can help ensure equal opportunity but that doesn't mean they will change anything about various gender gaps, and in many cases they won't. The cases in which gender gaps could have been erased are precisely the ones that have erased the most.
