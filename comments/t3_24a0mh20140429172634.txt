My grandpa died last month in the hospital. Before he died, he became incontinent. A nurse yelled at him *in front of my aunt* for not using his bedpan. Like he wasn't ashamed enough. Another nurse refused to wipe him frequently because "I can't do it every three minutes", and they all let him develop massive bedsores because "He doesn't seem to like to turn over."

I'd rather die than let nurses take care of me after the way he was treated. I've lost all trust in nurses.
