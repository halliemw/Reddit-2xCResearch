I also know the struggle of fine hair. I took the plunge and got a pixie cut about a year and half ago, and I'm currently in the process of growing it out. Have you thought about taking a hair supplement? I've seen results, not leaps and bounds, and I feel a bit better about growing my hair out. Also its done wonders for my nails :)
