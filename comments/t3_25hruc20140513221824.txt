I feel like a lot of pressure is put on people to get married (especially on women) by their 30s. But honestly 30 isn't old by a long shot.

And also as far as the height thing...I hate to admit it but that definitely is a factor. I'm a guy and I don't think I could date someone taller than I. Of course, I'm 6 foot 7 so that would be a really tall woman.
