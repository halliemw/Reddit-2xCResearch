I am also a fan of the lunette, and after the learning curve things are pretty great. However I bought my twin sister the same model and she does not use it as much, which kind of hurts me because I thought it would be an awesome gift for her (we are both in the Army and for me it least it's great not having to bring tampons to the field) but really you gotta find something that works for you. I don't think I'll ever go back to tampons (they and pads kinda gross me out now).
