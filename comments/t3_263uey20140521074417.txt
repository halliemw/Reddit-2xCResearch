Serious question: OP asked whether or not people think what she experienced was rape.  So why is every comment answering that question in the negative being deleted?

I'm not saying I agree with those commenters.  I'm just wondering why, in a thread where people are being asked a yes or no question, everyone giving a particular answer is being removed.  It just seems to run contrary to the "what do you think about this?" nature of the thread.
