I'm talking long-term in terms of decisions that many people make in youth that wear off in time. You're committed to not shaving, that's cool. Lots of people experiment with counter-cultural personas and appearances in their youth, only to grow out of them shortly thereafter. In this sense, if a person is doing something that turns a lot of people off (dirty dreadlocks, not mitigating body odor, whatever) and is going to be abandoned in time anyway, the long term sense is to abbreviate the window during which those choices are made.


Your comment on all decent guys not caring is pretty flakey. We all have preferences. I don't care if you shave your legs, but I love that my wife shaves hers. It would bug me if she didn't, just like it would bug her if I didn't shave my face. That doesn't make either of us indecent people, or belligerent executors of the status quo, but it means we have preferences for the textures we feel. 

Some people don't mind their own body odor and think it's oppressive to expect them not to smell bad. Okay, sure, you want to smell au naturale, that's cool. But I'm not a bad guy because you smell bad to me. You want to get a swastika tattoo on your face? Okay, that's your call, but I'm not a bad guy because I draw a conclusion that you have some anti-social tendencies. We all have the right to do with our bodies what we want. But it's a little vain to think that other people are somehow of negligible moral quality because they don't like scratchy legs or a mouthful of pubes during cunnilingus.
