Snarky does NOT help. To be fair, when he was really supportive while I was on meds and not interested - and patient. Then we've talked about how this wasn't "fixed" by me going off them, and he was patient. Our talks have been followed by him being very chill about it - and then after a few weeks, the snarky mode starts again. It IS very frustrating but obviously this just feeds into the issue.
