I  noticed  that  my  nipples  were  really sore  a  few weeks  ago and thought  my  lovely  piercings were  rejecting. I  was  heartbroken!  turns  out  my  nipples  were  just  dry and  chafing.  I  moisturized  them  and  have  since  built  up  a slight  callous. 

I  have  bars  and they work great,  make  sure you  buy anatometal  or a  comparable  brand.  it's expensive  but it goes inside  sensitive  soft tissue in an area that sweats,  big time. 
 good luck!
