I got Zofran,  too, because I came in to the ER already nauseous from the mega antibiotics they had previously prescribed. I think they may have given me the dilaudid first,  though, because I was clearly in distress and it made me vomit almost immediately. I don't know, it is all a little foggy now. There was a shot of Ativan mixed in there somewhere,  too, so I was pretty non-functional.
