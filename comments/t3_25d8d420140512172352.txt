I'm Australian, and I have implants. What size I gained when pregnant with my son is gone now, just 6 months later. I'm not yet 30, and I've had them for 7 years.  
  
Nothing short of surgery would have changed them, and since I was unable to change my attitude about them, I opted for surgery, which cost me $10,500.
