> Which is why he was found guilty.

Nope, not gonna cut it. A guilty verdicts means nothing, if it isn't matched by the punishment following.

>Danger to society -hmm first offence, what's the likelihood he'll do it again?

How in the hell do you figure it's a first offence, when he's done it over and over and over? The likelihood of it happening again is miles high. He is a serial offender.

Seriously, the judge made a grave error.
