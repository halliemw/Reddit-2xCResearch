Why so opposed to the f-word? This is exactly the point of feminism: You shouldn't have to put up with this shit, and yet, you do. Feminism basically means thinking that situation should change. There is (or should be) no shame in being a feminist - we're just unfortunate enough to live in a time when there are enough people who think women should just be expected to put up with harassment/stay in the kitchen/leave science to the men/etc. that openly admitting you disagree is still controversial.
