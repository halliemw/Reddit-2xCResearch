There are a lot of different perspectives on wearing Hijab and it can mean so many different things to different people. I am not a muslim/Hijabi but I have a friend who is. She wears it out of observance of religion, I don't think it it's so much a modesty issue. 

Yeah, wearing hijab, or any type of clothing in particular, isn't a guaranteed way to keep men from 'looking' (not sure if you mean inappropriate types of looking, or just in general). I think we should hold men to a high standard of respect, independent of what women are wearing. The burden shouldn't be on women.

>some next level idiots say wear niqab but thats just a unique brand of stupidity i wont get started on. they are ignorant and that type of ideology is cultural and archaic and village type ish. 

Why are you so convinced that hijab is the 'correct' thing, but niqab is weird/archaic?
