That is wrong, you should not be using birth control pills as emergency contraceptive. Depending on what kind of pill (mono or multi-phasic regimens) there can be serious consequences and adverse effects associated with this. DO NOT DO THIS. Emergency contraceptives contain levonorgestrel only and the only emergency contraceptive FDA indicated for up to 120 hours post intercourse is Ulipristal acetate. Not to mention that in general emergency contraception is only a viable option for up to 72 hours post coitus.
