I'm not saying I know exactly what I woman goes through when they have an abortion its just my opinion that a waiting period may be a good thing. I know in the UK its normal to wait about three to four weeks from your initial appointment to the actual appointment itself, this is so couples can go through counselling and so that they can have a better understanding of what is going to happen. For me this seems like a good idea.
