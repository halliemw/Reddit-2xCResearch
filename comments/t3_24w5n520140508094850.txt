You might want to note that people in the section she was supposed to be featured in were NOT fully clothed.  It's the assumption that the "new policy" of people being fully clothed was brought to the table in light of the picture she submitted.

Edited to add that you just commented on another thread with: "Looks are by far the most important thing to me, so it doesn't matter if I don't know their personality."  So, yeah... your argument is not valid.
