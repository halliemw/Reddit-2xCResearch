I love love lovee my paragaurd. I've had it for about 2 years now. Personally, although my period is regular in the timing sense, I still vary between good months (barely any cramping) and bad months (crippling pain with heavy bleeding). But I tell everyone that the couple ibuprofen I have to take to relieve this is 100% worth the benefits of care free and hormonal free birth control. Enjoy! :)
