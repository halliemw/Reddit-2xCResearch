The sad thing, is that while boys are being taught to be persistent, girls are being taught to be 'hard to get'. 

We're taught that our virtue/purity is our greatest asset so we have to be coy, shy, timid. We're supposed to say no when you ask us out, we're supposed to make you work for it. So even if we do want to spend time with a guy, we're taught to pretend we don't. If movies have taught me anything, it's that you don't have a true romance unless there's pointless drama wherein the guy 'fights' for you. If he stops 'fighting' for you then he obviously doesn't love you. /s ::eyeroll::

Meanwhile, you guys are being taught that we don't really mean no and that if you're persistent, confident and aggressive we'll eventually say yes. Your job is to overwhelm us with how passionate you are for us, to show us how deserving you are of our affection and to win us over by virtue or, if all else fails, brute force. As if we're pack animals and the biggest baddest male gets all the females in the herd. Which is why men end up frustrated and confused and women end up frustrated and scared. 

Our parents, grandparents etc really screwed us up. We have to take it upon ourselves to look at the world critically and realize that playing these outdated games are not only stupid but harmful to men and women equally. If we all decided to stop playing these games and just be honest and accept each other at our word then this shit would be history.
