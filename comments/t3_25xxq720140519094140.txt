I would say go to a dollar store or something like that with wide range of products. Preferable with friends which you can laugh with. If you live near The Netherlands, I would recommend Action. 

Choose a nice basket and go walking around in the shop and just throw nice and funny things in it. Go around the store multiple times. Do not put things back to fast. Just let it lay in the basket and if you think it really doesn't fit only then put it back.

Now you have hopefully a nice collection of stuff for cheap. Got to the register and pay. If you think after paying the basket is to cheap, go to stores who are specialized in the stuff you put in the basket and go for the more expensive and hopefully nicer stuff. 

My Archery club does this once a year. Hilarity ensues and most stuff are usable or really nice.
