Err, which part? Pooping in a squatting position, with heels near your bum and knees to your nips, is a much less stressful position for your gi tract than sitting. Your muscles relax and it becomes a lot easier to open up yo sphincter. If you have a western potty, just get a stool on put your feet on to raise your feet to bum level. 

Do not, however, squat on the rim of a western toilet. They are not built for that and if it breaks, it can seriously hurt you.
