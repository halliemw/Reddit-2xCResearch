it does sound like you're just being paranoid, but it's impossible to know for sure at this point. did you check the condom for leaks or tears when you were done? I've had 30 and 31 day cycles during times of stress when my average was around 27 or 28, so it could definitely be from everything else you've been worrying about, especially if you're losing sleep or if your diet has changed. it will probably show up when you least expect it.
