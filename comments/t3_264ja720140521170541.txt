You might consider pH as a culprit (I have cited peer-reviewed journal articles in the comment linked below) because it would dramatically affect your body's ability to fight these infections, but is rarely examined in standard medical tests.  It's also something you can try to correct inexpensively on your own.

In addition, I found several years ago that I was allergic to parabens, which are in nearly all anti-itching creams (like cortisone).  Mild allergies to antibiotics which have occurred from low-level use over time (e.g. Neosporin allergies) will cause similar local inflammation, pain, and itching.  If you do have an allergy to a treatment and have been applying it regularly, you may want to consider that the infection is being knocked out but the inflammation remains from your body reacting with each application of treatment.  


This was the case for me with atopic eczema that did not respond to treatment short of prednisone pills (not a cream!).    Once I found out I was allergic to parabens, I was able to just swap to ointments in place of all the creams in my life.


For UTIs and such, I just drink liters and liters of cranberry juice when I start to feel like maybe one might be creeping up on me.  It does prevent microbes from "sticking" and becoming an infection for a variety of body parts, even if it doesn't prevent their multiplication directly.
