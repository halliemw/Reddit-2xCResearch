I mean, Andrew Garfield is pretty good in the video, I'll give him that. And it's clear the Arcade Fire are trying to send a positive message here.

But there's bound to be confusion when they declared the song was about a gay guy coming out to his dad, and then they make a video like this, only saying "Our film follows the story of a young person's struggle with gender identity."

Cool. So by that little blurb, I can assume the character is a trans woman. So why not use a trans woman? It's not even that they'd need to find some insanely traditionally beautiful trans woman to play the part, they could pick a trans woman at any point of their transition. I'm sure there are enough out there who could have pulled off this music video with flying colours, so why did they feel the need to select a straight cis dude?

And while the violence shown is a legitimate plot device for the music video, due to how much violence the trans population experiences, they could have taken a teensy bit more positive route too, at least one that's not 100% operating in a fantasy (unless they're positioning the Coachella part as realistic, which I don't feel is the case). Giving the character some sort of happy ending that's more rooted in reality would have been nice. It would have said "Yeah, you can kick me around you motherfuckers, but I exist and you're not gonna get me down because I'm still having a good time, and society is changing" as opposed to "You motherfuckers can kick me around as much as you like, but I can still lay here beaten on the floor and fantasize about a life where I'm fiercely accepted and you dance along with me".

I mean, whatever. The music video's not horrible, it's alright. Just flawed. Videos from [Avicii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VJBBUqr1wM) and [Matt Nathanson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VJBBUqr1wM) have handled the transgender angle better in their videos, but at least I can take solace that there's a little more media support out there.
