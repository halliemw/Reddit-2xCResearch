When I read about it they do it on a sliding pay scale. In my opinion however, if you are in the US and your kid has cancer, you're not going to have a ton of extra money lying around in most situations. I want the people I give them to be free.  

Now Pantene isn't just for children, it's for adults as well.  They're actually partnered with the American Cancer Society. It's all free. Which makes sense, as Pantene isn't a nonprofit. It's a major organization that can found it.
