There is a lot more to a relationship than just the physical connection, but it is huge.  But, it is not okay to treat someone like that because there is disappointment.  It is not okay.  It is also not your fault that he didn't have that physical connection.  You did not mislead him.  When you think about it, there are so many facets of a relationship.  Odds alone, it's tough to find someone that meets your needs.  Then, you add in finding someone that does, that you fit theirs.  It's the crappiest of numbers games.

I know it hurts.  It's going to come down to putting one foot in front of the other, and keeping busy.  Don't let this guy prevent you from finding happiness, whether it's dating or whatnot.  Having a chubby body with a pretty face, as you note, doesn't mean that you aren't beautiful in many ways, as there are so many factors.  That guy doesn't see it?  That's on him and only him.  Screw him.
