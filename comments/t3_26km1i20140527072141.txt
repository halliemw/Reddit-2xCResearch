This article was quite jarring for me to read, mainly because it was speaking in what I've long perceived as "men's jargon" (and yes, I'm quite aware that women use "get laid" as well, I just mean the overall tone of the article).

Then, of course, there are people who downvoted the article without reading it properly. It's typical Reddit behavior.
