I have a little bit of a theory on this. I was blessed with 4 amazing grandparents of my own (two still surviving, one gpa passed when I was 7, his wife when I was 19) and gained another fabulous set when I married, and quickly fell in love with them as if they were my own. Here's the thing. My grandparents know im not perfect, but I have never heard a discouraging word. Its always been "you're beautiful, smart, kind, helpful, honest...." They are a source of unending and pure love. Parents get stuck with the hard part; they have to love is but also have to teach us to be decent people and enforce dicipline. Grandparents, however, simply chose to love us. They make us feel special. Ive learned so much from mine by listening to their stories of "back during the depression...", by seeing how they respond to situations with dignity and grace. Their wisdom is given freely, their advice comes with immeasurable amounts of love, and their concern is unending. They make us feel perfect, despite the fact that we know we're anything but. This is why grandparents are special. :)
