Florida's Romeo and Juliet laws allow 16 and 17 year olds to have sex with anyone 16 to 23. 15 year olds can't consent to sex under Florida law. 

It might seem silly and if the 15 did say yes and her bf was 16 (and if she wasn't medicated), but that's the law and he broke it. It just adds another layer that she was also heavily medicated.
