Saying you'll play by the rules is unparalleled intellectual laziness. You don't even deserve to be properly argued with because you lack the moral fibre to even consider being a part of the solution. It's as simple as not making snap judgments and just treating others well. I don't disagree that a solution is far down the road, but I disagree with your astounding laziness and waiting for everyone else to make the first move. Shame on you.
