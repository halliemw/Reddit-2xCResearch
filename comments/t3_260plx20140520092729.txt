It happens, unfortunately :( Some people are very fickle with their friendships. If she has a lot of female friends, they probably tend to shift around in terms of importance to her depending on who she sees the most frequently. My best friend from childhood is very much like that, whereas I'm more like you. For her wedding, she had three maids of honor, of which I was not one because I lived two hours away and she didn't see me that often. Of those three, she's on speaking terms with only one these days. Her current BFF is a girl that was best friends with her in high school but was not even in the wedding party because she was also living far away at the time. She's currently not on speaking terms with me because of a fight she got in with my ex over a year ago. This tends to shuffle around every couple of years.
