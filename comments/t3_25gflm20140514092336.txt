I incorrectly assumed that you were wishing that you were smaller. My apologies, I misread the tone of the post. My bad. Frankly I'm not one to believe in healthy at all weights, and being overweight in and of itself is hard on the body, but if you feel healthy and happy than that's really all that matters, and frankly your body is none of my business anyways. Cheers.
