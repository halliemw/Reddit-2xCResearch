It took me a year of mostly daily sessions before I stopped hurting. It was so bad that we had to stop several times before I made it so he couldn't see my face (he would see  me crying in pain and stop). I had asked a doctor for help and the response I got made me feel weird, alienated, and a freak. I figured if anyone would be able to help me it would be the woman who had her nose up my lady bits for a half hour. 
The idea I came up with was that I just had to "get through it" and I genuinely did enjoy the intimacy. I remember it hurting less and  less and I remember a period of indifference before it finally started to feel nice.
