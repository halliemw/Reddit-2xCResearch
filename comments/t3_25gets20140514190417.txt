Interesting. Thanks for sharing. Do you think that people like hair more with age, because I didn't like hairy chests in highschool when none of the boys had them, but as I became a woman, they became more attractive, and as I got experience with really hairy guys, I really began to appreciate their warmth and cozy softness. I have heard other people say they didn't like pubic ahir when young, but started to prefer it when older. I have heard the same for big butts and wide hips, which also seems to be a pedomorphic trait. I have lots of guy friends that loved narrow hips when young, but as they grew older, got really into more voluptuous ones.
