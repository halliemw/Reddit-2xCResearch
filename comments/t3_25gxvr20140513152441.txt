I guess I've always interpreted it in a more general way then I'm seeing in most of the responses here.  My basic definition of a "strong female character" is one that is well-written and three dimensional.  She has both good qualities and flaws.  She has goals,wants, needs, and desires. She has personal agency.  She plays an active role in the plot.  She exhibits character growth/change over the length of the work.  I don't think a strong female character is necessarily the hero of a work because a well-realized villain could also been a strong female character.  I also don't think it simply means "physically strong".

These are all things that would apply for "strong male characters" as well, it's just that it's less common to see the same amount of care go into the creation of female characters.  I think that has been gradually changing though.
