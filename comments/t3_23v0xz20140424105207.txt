I'm generally very comfortable with conversations with strangers, and I've been asked to grab coffee or lunch a few times. Generally though, if/when I say no, they politely excuse themselves, and maybe leave me with a business card. What this guy did was creepy because he kept pressuring you to have lunch with him after you told him no. He clearly felt you owed him lunch for some reason, and that sense of entitlement tends to set off alarm bells for me, too. He may have been perfectly nice and he may have had perfectly fine intentions, but he didn't handle the situation well and it's ok to feel creeped out by that.

I don't think that situation was particularly dangerous, though. You were in a public place, in daylight, and on most college or school campuses, you could run into any building during the day and have people nearby. Most around me also have emergency blue light phone things that you can push for help 24/7. I think turning him down for lunch was the right move, and not giving him your contact info is also the right move. I think everything else about the encounter was fine, though I probably would have left when he started the whole pressuring thing. 

All the bad "could have been" things would be unlikely at best. He could have physically assaulted you or dragged you to his car, but he's in a public place that likely has cameras on everything, and it's no easy feat dragging an adult around, especially a conscious one. He could have robbed you, but he didn't need to start a conversation for that. So basically, you did nothing wrong and nothing to endanger yourself.
