Yeah, you were too aggressive. Instead of posting the link (which i think was unnecessary and kind of rude in the first place) and saying something like "it's interesting the different perspectives people have on this movie!" you opted to write the condescending "yeah... about that..." As if one random fucking Medium writer is the oracle of feminism and Disney movies. While you may agree with her article, your/her opinion is no more valid than the person's who posted the picture on FB.

Then you go on to provoke your friend into an argument, often posting multiple inciting comments for every one of his. Nobody was going to "win" that argument. It was pointless and probably lost you a friend.
