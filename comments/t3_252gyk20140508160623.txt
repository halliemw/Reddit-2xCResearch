I have had to testify a number of times because of my profession, and it is always scary. They suggest you dress relatively professionally, which seems odd but is amazingly helpful with confidence. 

I use police officers as my model, since they testify in court all the time. They ONLY answer EXACTLY what was asked; they only talk about exactly what they observed. Don't try to elaborate or even interpret what you saw.
For example, I wouldn't venture to say something like, "The other driver was texting." At most I would say, "The other driver's head was going up and down as they drove."

"I don't know" is an answer. It is also perfectly ok to ask that a question be repeated. 

Remember that you don't have to decide anything or save anyone or get anyone convicted. Stick extremely close to what you observed.

Me, it always gives me a headache. So ice cream afterward. How grown-up is that?
