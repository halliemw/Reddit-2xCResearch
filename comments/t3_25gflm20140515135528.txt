My (probably soon-to-be-ex) boyfriend's friends are like this. They won't engage with me at all because I'm fat and therefore "not worthy" of their time. They constantly make disparaging remarks about people being fat and have straight-out said that they don't like certain people simply because they are fat.

I don't understand how someone can decide that another person is not worth talking to just from looking at them :(
