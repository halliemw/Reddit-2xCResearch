That's an interesting way of seeing it. I know that I've been careful to not say anything back if I'm walking alone rather than in a busy street,  to not compromise my safety. But it is still frustrating that as women we can't go and do everything we would want to in certain neighbourhoods or at certain times of the day, just because of the fear of sexual assault. It's frustrating that we can't go to places alone and depend on men to be respected in public.
