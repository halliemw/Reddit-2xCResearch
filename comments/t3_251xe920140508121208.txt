One OP isn't overreacting, well from what I can see, but it is possible that she doesn't see some of the issues in the same way that her husband does. This is why counselling is important.

BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT OP. Try not to force him because he's already under a lot of stress and this may lead to a larger conflict try to convince him to go. 

You have to understand that by going to counseling he has to face the fact your relationship isn't perfect. And as a man that's really frightening (I'm male) at the same time we're rather conditioned to believe you have to be crazy to go to counseling and that can be worrying. 

Try telling him just how much you love him and make sure he knows that. It could be beneficial to start going along and convince him eventually to go with you. 

You guys have a lot of love for each other and it's important to remind yourself of that OP. Best of luck OP I hope it all works out! :)
