[Per the ACOG,] (http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Ethics/Sexual_Misconduct) "The request by either a patient or a physician to have a chaperone present during a physical examination should be accommodated regardless of the physician's sex."

In practice, though, many gynes don't use chaperones unless you specifically request one.
