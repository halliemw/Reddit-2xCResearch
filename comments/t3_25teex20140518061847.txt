The very first time I started birth control pills, they caused a very deep, borderline suicidal depression in me. I had a whole host of other side effects too and my gynecologist told me to continue taking them for 3 months and report back. 

I suffered through, and at the very end of third month, it was light someone flipped a switch. The depression was gone, the side effects abated, I was finally normal again. 

The reason why I mention this is because I want to make sure when you're trying new hormones, you give it a good go. You mention having a rough time after your first week of the new pack, so try and tough it out. Of course, keep and eye on your depression all the while. 

Additionally, many in the field of psychology work on a sliding scale, so you pay for services based on the amount you can afford.  

You'll get this whole thing figured out!!
