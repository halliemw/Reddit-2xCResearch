So sorry it took me so long to respond - I had a pretty rough week.  Unfortunately those happen as part of this. 

I'm also so sorry to hear that your childhood had that void in it.  I know many people who have taken situations like that, and decided to make sure that *their* children would never feel that way.

From the love that is obvious in your words, in your writing, I can tell that you are one of those - and that, in the end is strength, to take something that is painful, and turn it into something wonderful for others. 

(If I overstep at all, please forgive me or ignore it.)

As far as the email client goes, I use gmail right now.

And hey, today is my birthday, and I've been asking everyone I know to celebrate by buying a few cupcakes and passing them out to someone who is less fortunate than themselves:  to go to a hospital, a shelter, a retirement home, somewhere, and pass them out, then take pics and post them.  If you want to do that, it would be awesome.

You can find me on fb under "Dov Siporin" if you want to see what some of the other people are doing, and see photos and stuff. 

I hope the day treats you well.

Dov...aka canceryguy.
