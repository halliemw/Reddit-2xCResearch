Different, yes. But I think they're both equally bad, but in different ways.

*Cute* is kind of patronizing. Like, "aww, lookit you widdle girl knowing how to do big man things!" but a lot of people don't realize that saying that is patronizing. Cute is a feminine compliment in modern day America. Society says that girls should *want* to be cute (and many of us do), so saying someone is cute is often not meant as demeaning. However, saying that our knowledge of something is "cute" or really saying that any thing we do (that any man could do on any old day) is cute, simply because we're women, is patronizing. It feels like we shouldn't be able to do it in the first place, and when we can, it doesn't really mean as much as when a man would do it because it's so "cute" when we do it.

When someone says *hot* though, that's kind of sexually degrading. I know it's not a totally fair comparison, because I *have* said to my boyfriend that his ability to fix computers is hot, but I think that something being hot just because it's not expected that a girl would do it is degrading. It's like implying that we have knowledge that women "shouldn't" have, so that's hot. It's also kind of uncalled for if it's just a friend like that (and not a boyfriend like how I do with my SO), because it's disregarding our knowledge as a person and as a human to turn us back into sexual objects at a moment where we are discussing something decidedly non-sexy.
