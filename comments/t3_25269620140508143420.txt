Okay, so I find this super cool, but I feel like she's targeting the wrong user group and isn't far enough along in the development process that I should get too excited. If I were her, I'd be going for the niche groups that currently have problems finding makeup. People who want vegan makeup, or who are allergic to certain ingredients, or who want a powdered concealer that doesn't contain titanium dioxide. She can have different bases that fir the needs of the specialty customers (or maybe even an offer to mix a special base for special needs?) that would allow people used to paying a premium for bland shades to get creative. 

Alternatively, market it to people with money (young professionals in the 20-30 age range). I feel like she spent all night making sure hey prototype would work and figured out her user group as she was making her slides.


Also, I'm mildly annoyed that that tech conference couldn't find even one female judge.
