I'd go with you on the opposite gender thing if girls had any way not to be cute. But it is more like:

Guy doing masculine stuff: normal/cool

Guy doing feminine stuff: cute

Girl doing feminine stuff: cute

Girl doing masculine stuff: cute

That's really kind of annoying for girls who want to get away from being considered cute.
