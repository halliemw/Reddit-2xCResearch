Dude....the American medical system has been broken for a LONG ASS TIME. Obama did not create the problem. He made an attempt to make it better, and actually did fix some stuff (you can't be refused for pre-existing conditions, no lifetime caps on care, young adults can stay on their parents' insurance for longer). Obamacare is super imperfect, it is a bandaid used to stem an arterial bleed, basically --- but at least he tried to do something. 

To sum up. He didn't break the shit, it was broken already. Quit blaming him for America's shit system. It's way more complicated than you think.
