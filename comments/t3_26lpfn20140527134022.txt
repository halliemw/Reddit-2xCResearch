Hey! I'm a house-girlfriend right now too. I just completed school and am on the job hunt. My boyfriend says he doesn't expect me to do anything extra, but I still feel obligated to do a lot of the housework. I usually take care of the housework, we split the dishes for the most part, and take a "whatever" approach to who cooks. Once I'm working I'm not sure how these tasks will divvy up, but for now I feel like it's my "job" to clean house.

So I definitely feel where you're coming from with the guilt. I get worried he'll end up resenting me if I don't justify me weight. However - I think you're doing awesomely, and the fact that you're worrying about it shows that you're not just a "worthless freeloader". You're a functional member of the household, and just because this is how things are right now doesn't mean they'll always be this way.

The biggest thing I've been working on while struggling with this is not worrying about the opinions of other people. The person whose opinion I value most is my boyfriend's, and if he's okay with me turning down crappy jobs to wait for a better opportunity, then I'm not going to let other peoples' potential opinions about me being a "freeloader" bother me. I just do my best to apply to jobs, be helpful, and clean house. I know I'm not freeloading, he knows I'm not freeloading, and that's what matters.

Best of luck!!
