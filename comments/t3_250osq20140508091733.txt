This may come across as nitpicky but I think you should be careful about referring to people as "females." It comes across as detached and dehumanizing, like you are assuming the character of an oblivious scientist. It's sort of weird and off-putting, mostly because that sort of language tends to correlate strongly with unwitting sexism.
