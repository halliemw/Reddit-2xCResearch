As someone who went solo across the USA on a motorcycle, couch surfing and camping the whole way (and who managed to destroy *both* cell phones along the way), this is definitely a good idea. There are also gps trackers available e.g. SPOT trackers which actually use satellite communications, so if you are in an emergency and you are out of cellular service, you can get help.

The SPOTs also let you dedicate a few emails that can access your relatively up to date position online anytime the tracker is on. It's not going to stop someone from attacking you but if you break a leg on a hike, it could save your life.

-edit- looks like it was already suggested. In that case, just make sure to take more pictures and videos than you think are necessary. I didn't take enough on my trip and I'm kinda sad about it.
