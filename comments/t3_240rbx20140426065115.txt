I had my Mirena fitted in 2012. It was.... agony. I threw up afterwards it hurt so badly, was almost hospitalised due to my blood pressure dropping through the floor, and I had problems with almost constant bleeding/spotting for a year afterwards. Now that it has FINALLY settled down I don't have many issues with it and am glad for the no-fuss BC. My only concern now is that it seems to make UTIs/ thrush/ BV more likely, although that is under control now too.
