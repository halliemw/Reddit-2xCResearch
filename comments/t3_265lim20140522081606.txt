>You are literally trying to muddy the waters by making an already absurd example even more absurd. 

If it's an example that could happen, it's something that needs to be considered. 

>So not only do we now have a woman who is going home with a guy she flirted with, initiated sex and then changes her mind and says no, but now she is a Hollywood actress level faker of pretending to want it, the other guy is a decent bloke who even asks her if anything is wrong, and she convincingly gives a Richard the III level speech to the guy to convince him everything is fine, all while being afraid and in pain and terrified. Yeah, sure, this is the issue with grey areas of consent. This contrived example. 

I was talking about a person who goes home with another person they flirted with, initiating sex, decided they are uncomfortable, but shows extremely minimal signs of discomfort because they don't want anything to be awkward. The other person senses a little bit of awkwardness that could potentially be discomfort and asks if anything is wrong, and the partner, not wanting to make things awkward or just wanting to situation to be over soon, or maybe just because they are shy and can't speak their mind, ensures them that everything is ok even though it's not, and does their best to pretend as such. They may or may not be afraid or in pain or terrified. This is not a contrived example. I myself have been in a lot if situations like this. Sex is all about communication, but it's a two way street, and sometimes it's hard. 

>I'm sorry but what is your point? That because someone can in absurdis fake non verbal consent, the lack of verbal consent or dissent it is automatically consent? So basically if we go to bed, and I don't say no verbally, then no matter what happens afterwards it is not rape? So that unless I say no, the default is yes? 

No that's not my point at all. My point is that things need to be communicated clearly. That doesn't necessarily mean verbally, but just enough so that the other party knows the situation. I am just as responsible for making sure my partner knows I'm consenting (or not) as they are for doing the same for me, and they are as responsible for making sure they know that I am consenting (or not) as I am for them. If I want to stop having sex, I can't expect them to read my mind and know that unless I clearly communicated it to them somehow (though words, or though things like body language as you described).  If we go to bed, and I don't do anything that they could pick up on that would signify a withdrawal of consent whatsoever (no freezing up, no lack of moaning, no dead fishing, no "no", no "slow down", no "stop",) then it's consensual.  If I make the decision that I would rather just pretend to enjoy the sex that I'm not enjoying so that I can get it over with and not create a weird situation, that is me giving consent. If I decide the next day that I should have shown some signs and tried to stop it from happening, that's me regretting having given consent. This is something that has happened to me multiple times, and many other people as well. 

> Let's make it clear here. Rape is not an accident done by people who are merely careless. It's not the semen equivalent of dropping a slice of buttered bread on the floor. It is your responsibility as a party to sex to check for enthusiastic, and positive consent. 

Consent doesn't have to be enthusiastic or positive. Bad sex isn't rape, it's just bad sex. I've had sex where partway though I just decided I really wasn't having any fun, and while it might have been nice to just stop, I didn't want to make things weird, so I just lay back, eventually fake an orgasm and let my partner finish. Deciding to do this instead of stoping *is consent* but it's not positive or enthusiastic. It's the sex equivalent of "This gift from my friend really sucks, but I'll just pretend I like it a throw it away later so things don't get awkward". 

>If you do not, it is your **choice** to do so. You don't rape by mistake the same way you do not cheat by mistake.

>There is always a choice on what you willingly do to the other person and. Series of choices narrowing down the options available further. And with that choice of actually doing something to someone's body comes the responsibility to check for how that is received. 

I absolutely agree. Not checking for consent is a problem, and it's something both parties are responsible for, right along with clearly communicating consent. There is always a choice on what you communicate to a person, and if you choose to communicate that everything is fine even if you're a little uncomfortable, or the sex isn't that good, or you feel a little sick, or your vagina is getting kinda sore, or they are riding your dick in an uncomfortable way, etc, then that is consent for them to continue. 

>If you are an intimidating bloke, you should be aware you are intimidating and how that can affect people. If I am a 6'4 300 pound guy, I will damn sure not hold a stranger chick in the corner of a room alone and start undressing her. Unless she has been begging me to do so and we had an ongoing and mutual thing. I would approach her in a way that she cannot feel pressured whatsoever. Fuck it, I'd allow her to make a step. Even if by doing so I might miss out on some willing but shy sex, that is a small price to pay then to risk having even one chick feel forced to play along because I physically dominate her. Again, with power comes responsibility. And if it is in your power to dominate someone so they submit from coersion it ks your duty to manage that power. 

Lots of things can make someone intimidating. I'm sure guys are very intimidated by extremely beautiful women. Hell, I get intimidated by small guys with cute boyish smiles.  But yeah I agree if you're intimidating, don't do that kind of thing. That said, you do go after shy but consensual sex, you're an asshole, but not a rapist. 


>Just look at dogs who instinctively do this. An older or bigger dog will not play threateningly with a smaller dog/puppy. If the tiny dog gets actually scared and not play scared they back off. If a dog can do it so can a human. 

Yes. If the smaller dog communicates it's fear to the other dog, and the other dog picks up on it, it will back off. 

>But let's be serious here. I can't say I have met accidental bullies, nor accidental rapists. 

Exactly. You don't commit rape by accident. If you ignore signs of lack of consent, that's absolutely rape. 

>Rapists who coerce know exactly what they are doing. 

Yes

>If you are a guy who wants sex at all costs, you **will** make consent blurry by trying to make your date drink. You **will** hit o. A person you know, with whom you are intangled in a common friends group. Because everyone hates standing out or embarassing themselves by having their friends know every dirty intimate detail. You **will** manipulate verbally or ask repeatedly after several noes until the person submits (common psychological effect when badgered with the same question). You will physically prevent someone from moving but avoid actual harm. You will prey on people who are shy, unassertive and likely to fold under pressure.

Um no. The majority of people do no such thing no matter how much the want sex just like how the majority of people don't steal just because they want something and don't have the money. The people who do are criminals, in this case, rapists. 

(Although I'd point out that asking repeatedly is hardly manipulation. If you give consent just because someone asked over and over again, and you aren't in some kind if situation where you fear what the person might do if you say no, that's consent)

>Why? Because this gets you sex. Coherced sex but in the eyes of the people around you both went in the room, and she didn't fight back. Or said yes eventually

What's wrong with eventually saying yes? I've been in situations were someone hits on my repeatedly throughout the night and I slowly gain interest despite my previous lack of such. Maybe my friend went home with a guy and I feel lonely, maybe the hotter guys left. That's still consent. 

>Or was too drunk to handle a psychological manipulation.

Yeah alcohol is a huge problem in these situations I won't argue with that. 

>Because there won't be physical trauma, just psychological.

I would hesitate to call a less than desirable consensual one night stand "psychological trauma"

>And because people will immediately focus on the victim's responsibilities and not the accused. Did she say no? Did she say no clearly enough? Did she fight back? Did she ask for a condom? Did she report right away? Was she crying when reporting? Why was she pretending to be happy at the party afterwards of ot wasn't just regret sex. 

I think that people will focus on both of their responsibilities, but because one is the 'victim', it will seem more directed at them because people won't find it hard to believe that the accused didn't live up to his responsibilities. But most of the things you listed there are completely irrelevant, and are not responsibilities of anyone involved in sex, which is clearly why you listed them, so your point stands on those counts. 

>So no, let's not muddy the waters and put all weight on the potential victims' shoulders.

Let's not. Let's put the weight were it belongs, which is a case to case issue. 

>It is everybody's responsibility to make sure consent is there.

And it's everybody's responsibility to make sure their partner is able to relatively easily determine consent is there. 

>err on the side of the fucking caution and either make sure or stop.

Absolutely.
