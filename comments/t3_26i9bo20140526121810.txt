Unless there is more going on than your post indicates, it sounds like you need to trust your feelings more. Seriously. They are real, they are valid reactions, they are not something you need to apologize for.

You had a (sounds like quite minor) car accident or mishap. Maybe for some people that's no big deal. Personally I'm pretty sure I'd just sit there crying too. The question is why your boyfriend isn't concerned/helpful.
