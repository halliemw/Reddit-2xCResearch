There are plenty of horror stories going around about police refusing to listen to survivors, etc. Almost no reported rapes lead to conviction. I would not report sexual assault if I was the victim. I would seek help and treatment, and if I knew the perpetrator, I would tell my friends and ask them to protect me. This is obviously the wrong course of action, since many rapists are serial rapists and by not reporting I would place other women in danger, but this is what would make me feel safest.
