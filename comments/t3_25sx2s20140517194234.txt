I just want to make a comment on the "Academic", post modern feminist style definitions that have been taking root lately. The truth of the matter is, these definitions are nothing more than attempts to obscure the reality of the situation.

Aside from the absurd annoyance that comes with playing the oppression Olympics, the reality is that bigotry and sexism, while they do overlap quite a bit are not in fact the same thing.

The more traditional definition of sexism is far better simply because it is far clearer, from wikipedia "Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender"

The definition of Bigot however is "someone who, as a result of their prejudices, treats or views other people with fear, distrust or hatred on the basis of a person's ..."

So if you were to make the statement, "men make bad fathers", that would be sexist, but it would not be guaranteed to be bigoted, which is where the post modern definition falls apart. As there are plenty of emotions that could make you feel that way that don't fall into fear, distrust or hatred.
