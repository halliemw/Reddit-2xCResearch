> So girls can't memorize? Is that because they spend all their time memorizing to get better grades than boys?

That doesn't make sense to me, are you saying that girls get higher test scores than boys? That's not true based on the study. They get higher grades. Grades are determined by a lot more than test scores. Homework, class participation, how much the teacher likes you, etc. all play a larger role.
