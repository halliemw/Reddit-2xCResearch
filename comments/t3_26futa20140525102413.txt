Yes. I see it as an example of the influence of extremist ideology, and one of the hallmarks of extremist ideologies is to completely oversimplify the world in stark and irrational terms of us versus them. If Rodger had been visiting Stormfront and shot up, say, a Jewish museum instead of a sorority, we'd be shaking our head at the White Rights movement instead of Men's Rights, like they're doing right now in Belgium. When extremist ideologies appeal to people with mental illness and personality disorders, you get terrorism â€” it's not like you can point to any suicide terrorist or mass murderer as a shining example of mental health. I'm sure there are not-quite-insane people on jihadist forums that argue that maybe killing innocent civilians isn't such a great idea if they're trying to get ahead in the world.
