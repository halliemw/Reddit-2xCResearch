My mom isn't manipulative in any way. She never told me to forgive him just to move on and not make an issue of it. She comes from a background of abuse as well so I understand her actions. Knowing all of this I still resent the fact that she never stood up for us or herself in the past. Since going to therapy she's been more vocal with my dad and it seems their relationship is getting better BUT still when he gets angry he almost goes blind and says extremely hurtful things. My mom encourages me to do whatever I please, but I know whenever I go for extended periods of time she gets lonely even if she doesn't tell me.
