Yes, all true, but I think that using terms like "identify" are a bit ambiguous. When someone identifies with a joke, it doesn't necessarily mean they agree with the subject matter, it just means that they are familiar with it or understand it. Finding a joke funny doesn't mean that you agree with the subject matter at hand, or that you share a particular belief with regards to it. The idea that all jokes have an underlying moral message that you need to agree with to enjoy them is just... reaching.

I'm going to butcher a joke here for the sake of brevity in explaining what I mean, since today my joke switch seems to be off:

An angel brings a male and female statue to life in a park, winks at them and says they can do anything they want for the next hour. So they run to the bushes, from which sounds of mischief and giggling emerge, while the angel blushes. They come back out 15 minutes later and begin to thank the angel who tells them they still have 45 minutes left and grins. The female statue gets really excited, turns to the male statue and says "this time **you** hold the pigeon down and **I'll** shit on it's head!"

The joke sets up the expectation that the statues are going to have sex and takes you by surprise with the punchline, as jokes are wont to do. It does **not** mean that I believe in angels, it does **not** mean that I think about statues having sex, it does **not** mean that I think it's okay to abuse animals, and liking this joke does **not** make me a bad person.

Now, one could make the argument that sexist or racist jokes are wrong as they perpetuate and remind people of terrible things. However, that is something else entirely from saying that finding a particular joke funny makes you sexist or racist.


Do you disagree?
