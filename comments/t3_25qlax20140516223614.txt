I tried it, got the recommended size for after childbirth since I have had 3 vaginal births. I think maybe my vagina is not long enough, I put it in as deep as it could go and the stem part was sticking out and hurting my labia. I cut it off and it still was too long. And then it just works itself out after a couple minutes of walking around. So...long story short it's not going to work for me. I was disappointed since so many love it. If you can very easily reach your cervix like me, it maybe be too long for you too.
