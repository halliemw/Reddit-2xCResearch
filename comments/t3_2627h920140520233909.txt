Males in my family tended to act like it was a good thing when this started happening to me as a kid. In part this made me look for all the wrong things in boys/men for a long time. I would just be sure to be open with her about this being inappropriate behavior and being sure she knows how to protect herself and what to do if she feels threatened or if behavior becomes criminal. Also, it would have helped me a lot if men around me had helped me grow positive qualities less related to my looks, like sports, writing, art, science, etc
