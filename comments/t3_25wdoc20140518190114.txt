Awesome.   The "no swearing" thing reminds me of Tina Fey's story about one of the first times she met Amy Poehler.   Amy was telling an off-colour joke, and one of the male SNL cast members said "Oh, don't talk like that!  It's so unladylike, and I don't like it!"   Amy glared at him and said "Excuse me - I wasn't talking to you, and furthermore, I don't give a fuck what you think."
