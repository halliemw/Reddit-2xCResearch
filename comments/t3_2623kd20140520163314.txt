I can relate to number 2.

I once worked in an office where the male employees were basically trained to be terrified of the female employees.  They brought in a harassment prevention consultant who told them all sorts of supposed horror stories like: a guy being fired because a woman felt he maintained eye contact for too long when they passed in the hallway, a guy being fired because a woman felt he shook her hand for too long, guy being fired for saying he liked a woman's outfit, etc.

As one of the few women in the office, I felt like a had a black cloud hanging over me.  Whenever I entered a room, there would be a gasp of air and everyone would suddenly become silent and bury their faces in their work.  Not wanting to even look at me.  I know that some companies are hyper-vigilant when it comes to harassment for fear of lawsuits, but I definitely think fostering a climate of fear and loathing amongst your employees is hardly the best business practice.  None of those examples would legally be considered harassment and there certainly wouldn't be cause to fire them unless the company was unreasonably paranoid about lawsuits.
