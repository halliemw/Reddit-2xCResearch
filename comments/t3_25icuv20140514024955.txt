I don't consider my behaviour cute. I've already taken responsibility and made amends where they were necessary. I don't find it necessary to explain to the internet how I've rectified my behaviour, but suffice it to say that this happened many years ago; I had a serious issue with alcoholism which has since been dealt with.

And I never said OP owed the guy anything. I meant she should try to discern for her OWN sanity and safety what state of mind he was in. If someone attacked me in any way, shape, or form, then I would want to know all the relevant details when dealing with the situation. Someone who gropes someone whilst shitfaced is a different animal than someone who gropes someone whilst sober and in full control of their faculties. OP asked how to proceed, and in my experience, it just helps to clarify all the circumstances when handling something like this. I've had my fair share of abusive situations in life and whether someone was intoxicated or sober at the time does make a difference in how you deal with the fallout of an incident. Drugs never excuse the behaviour, but they are a relevant detail. 

I'm not saying that it *wasn't* deliberate. But I wasn't there, and neither was anyone in this thread (except OP). So if I were her, I'd just want to kinda interrogate the guy with an open-ended question to see what he thinks/claims happened... you can tell a lot by how someone responds. If he's immediately super defensive, then that's a red flag. If he tries to laugh off the behaviour or minimise it, that's a red flag. Etc. But if he seems confused and apologetic for his indiscretions... well, maybe it WAS a drunken mistake. Those do happen.
