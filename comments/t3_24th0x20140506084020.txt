* Stop being flirty, or at least be flirty but assertive that you're with someone & not interested. 

* Guys don't take hints like that, if a girl is even remotely flirty, a guy will take it as "She likes me!" or "We're having a good time, let's keep it going!". Most are so dense they have no idea what's going on around them. 

* Your boyfriend is right, you need to tone it down. You don't need to change your personality at all, you just need to make it clear to others in some capacity that you're taken or have a boyfriend when the opportunity presents itself.
