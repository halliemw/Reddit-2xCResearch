I used to work somewhere that prompted me to go out and buy a fake engagement ring (and I didn't even have a boyfriend). $20 at Kohl's (and totally not my style :P). But it's the one thing that says out loud, "I'm not interested or looking." I did it because I was getting hit on by A LOT of scarily persistent guys that I had zero interest in and I wanted to put a stop to it. The majority of my shifts were worked alone (evenings) because we weren't as busy. Basically, I knew I wasn't going to meet my future boyfriend/husband at a train station coffee shop. The ring came off in my car after shifts, and went on again before the next one.

So I think you're right...this author is ignoring the kind of dangerous situation women can be put in if their reason for not being interested isn't "good enough". Which is sick, but still exists.
