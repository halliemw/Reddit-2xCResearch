I felt the same way with two years left to go. The 2nd last year was a nightmare and for the last year I made a commitment to myself to just buckle down and get it done. In the end, I was glad I'd finished, but that doesn't mean finishing is right for everyone.

Also, with two years left, is there anything else you have enough credits in to look at using as a major if your major is the issue? I switched my major to psych and my minor stayed the same (history). The reason it worked was because I already had taken quite a lot of psych credits. I dumped my English major because I felt like it was sucking my soul out - I was starting to hate reading!! What's your minor? What else have you taken a lot of courses in?
