You're in a way rephrasing my point. What I was saying is that, if he was in a state where he was still able to understand and remember the "yes means no" she told him so very often, he absolutely is to be blamed. If, on the other hand, they were both so drunk that they were both not any more aware of the limitations they both set to themselves, and then (in consent) started playing, I find it very difficult to blame a single person.

Besides, I get the feeling you're a tad pessimistic about things. We can neither simply assume that her former boyfriend has the urges and thoughts of a serial rapist, nor that he meant to hurt her because he was "prone to assault". What is it that keeps you from thinking of an accident first, before you think of rape?

Also, am I right to think "accidental rape" is a sober person taking advantage of a drunk person? My first post should have made clear that I condemn that as much as you do. I hope you noted that I several times explicitly mentioned that my thoughts were based on the assumption of equal drunkness. 

When both parties aren't anymore able to consent themselves and to see whether the other is consenting, how do you justify blaming one person more than the other? This is what the situation boils down to, in my opinion. We know the first perspective, we don't know the second.
