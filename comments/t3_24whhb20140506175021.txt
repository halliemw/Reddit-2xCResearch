Coming from a straight dude, I'm going to be honest, this guy is not the one. His feelings are 100% legitimate but there's too much risk. If you do have the child and it doesn't work out, you'll double regret it. If you have the abortion, it'll be sad, your parents will be upset, but you'll have a chance to have a child someday when you're ready. Also, there's a small chance that you guys could get past this. I just don't see the upside in having a child you don't want. While you can always get pregnant and get married some day, you can't un-have a child. That could be bad for you and the child...
