I'm very wary of labeling any kind of interaction with a stranger "creepy" because I think that sort of thinking is bad for society.  The guy might have had the best of intentions and been a totally cool dude, but you know what?  You were uncomfortable and rightly so, especially when he kept pressuring you after you politely refused to go to lunch with him.  If he legitimately wants to network, he should approach the school administration for such opportunities, not ambush people in a parking lot.  I'm mean, creep or not, the guy lives in society and he must know how approaching a lone woman in a parking lot looks, right?  

The thing you need to remember is that you don't owe this guy (or any future people who ring your alarm bells) anything.  Not a single thing.  If you don't feel safe, leave.  Make something up, like "I'm late for class, gotta go" or just outright walk away.  I'm pretty sure you know the difference between social anxiety and that little voice that tells you "This situation is wrong."  Listen to that voice. Your safety is more important than being a little off-putting to someone you'll probably never see again in your life.

Seriously, in a situation like that, don't worry about being social.  I know it's hard - I also have that compulsion to be nice as pie to everyone I meet even if they're making me so uncomfortable I want to crawl out of my skin - but you just have to work on listening to your intuition and saying no.
