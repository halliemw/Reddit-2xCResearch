It was to be expected that the trolls would be all over excited about a reason to get at us, and if you could see the modqueue and quite the volume of shit your friendly neighbourhood mods have been shoveling since we went default, you'd be glad you're not us.  However, once the "new-ness" dies down it should be fine.  It doesn't help that certain other subs (cough, red pill, cough) are brigading us to shit.
