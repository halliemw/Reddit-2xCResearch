> You are reading something completely else into my words. No one said he couldn't have an opinion, he just doesn't have the choice whether to abort or not.

Oh, OK, sure. But this is in no way expressed by "I am not sure why you feel that he is allowed anything..." I was reacting to what you said, not what you meant.

> Unless some law has cropped up that denies women rights over their own bodies?

Talk about a strawman argument.

> Feel free to share your pregnancy/abortion stories with OP, I am sure you can help her figure out what she needs to do.

> She posted a 'help'.

This is no way connected to what I was talking about. I was not addressing OP at all, I was reacting to your words specifically.
