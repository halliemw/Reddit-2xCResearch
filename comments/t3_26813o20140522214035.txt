I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, if eye candy is going to be part of the show then women should not be the only people who take on that role. Showing both male and female bodies is important.

On the other hand, I think people sometimes forget what genitalia is. Penises have been shown a few times already, albeit briefly. But AFAIK, female genitalia has never been shown on Game of thrones. We've never seen a woman spread her legs. We've never seen a vulva or a clitoris. Female nudity is less... revealing than male nudity, and so I have some sympathy for the show producers' dilemma.
