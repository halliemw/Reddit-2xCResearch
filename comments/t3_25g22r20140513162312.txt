It depends on which pill you're taking as to whether it's alright to skip placebo week,but ask your doctor. On mine ( LoEstrin), she said it's no problem. I also don't HAVE to have one every few months, but she said if I don't, I might start to have some breakthrough spotting as the endometrial lining just builds up too much, so it seems more reasonable to have one predictable period every few months rather than have the potential for bleeding at any random moment.
