> The regulations for when a person should get a pap smear have actually changed recently, because at some point they realized it was causing more stress than it was preventing cancer. 

Those recommendations (not regulations) were only changed for women who have never had an abnormal Pap smear. At this point, the OP isn't getting a screening Pap, she's getting a follow-up, which is a completely different ball of wax.
