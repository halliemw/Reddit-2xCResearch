Great post but I just wanna point out that there *are* issues with conceiving where the guy is older. Women in their 30s with partners 5 years older are a lot less likely to conceive each cycle than women with partners the same age or younger, and for men with a low concentration of sperm each year of paternal age was associated with a 5% decrease in chance of pregnancy. Older guys have lower semen volume, lower sperm motility, and a decreased percent of normal sperm (higher risk for genetic diseases). Infertility becomes more common as men age as well. So the time issues go both ways.
