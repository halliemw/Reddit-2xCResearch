Even for no apparent reason?  
With my current level of intimacy I could only get pregnant if sperm were able to go through two layers of underwear, so I'm not worrying about being pregnant.  
It's just that I'm so used to having my period regularly for all these years that I find it a bit unsettling that it's late.
