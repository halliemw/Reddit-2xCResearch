That is fantastic, congratulations!! I'm in the same year as you and I've actually had a very similar experience- my lowest GPA by far was first semester of freshman year, and it's risen slowly but steadily since then. Last semester was the first time in my life I've gotten all As and I was so happy, so I'm shooting for the same thing this semester! It feels so good doing well though.
