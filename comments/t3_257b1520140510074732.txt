The goal was never to get rid of every male viewer, but these TMI posts do a good job of getting rid of male viewers who are so offended by thought of *ohthehorror* talking about our bodily experiences as women like they do as men in almost every other corner of reddit. No, I don't want those types of people (especially the ones who felt the need to comment and tell us off) in this sub because their attitudes do not make it a safe place. 

 You see the community falling apart? After watching this sub get heavily brigaded because redditors couldn't handle the thought that a women-centric sub had the audacity to go default, and now seeing us come together and say "No, you're not going to shut us up" you see that as falling apart? The sub will return to normal in a little while. There is no need to get upset.
