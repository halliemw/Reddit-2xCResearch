Why would you want a child to grow up in a household that doesn't want it? That just seems cruel. It's far worse to subject a kid to parents that don't want it and never did than it is to prevent it ever entering that environment. Sure, adoption's an option, but adoptive parents (as a general rule) want healthy white babies, and what if you're a minority? Your baby will go into the foster care system, which is awful and overcrowded, and they will again likely grow up in a bad home situation.

If you're so pro-life, why do you want to make a woman have a baby she never wanted? That kid is likely going to grow up resented by its mother, and that's no way for a kid to grow up.
