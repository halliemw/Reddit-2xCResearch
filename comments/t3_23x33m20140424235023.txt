I'm just a stranger on the internet, but OP, I am SO SO SO proud of you. I've been hoping to see an update from you, and am really impressed by your strength and grace in handling this situation.

I'm currently a law student financing my entire legal education through student loans (~250K when it's all said and done). I know that number looks terrifying, but hear me out. The government currently has a program where your student loans are forgiven after ten years if you work for the government or a 501c3. There are many law schools, including several in the T-14 that will pay all or part of what you owe for those ten years, depending on how much you earn. You can do income-based loan repayment, where your maximum yearly loan amount is based on how much you make. 

If you have really good grades, a really good LSAT score, or ideally both, schools are handing out merit-based scholarships left and right. Application numbers are down, so to keep enrollment up, schools are working really hard to convince their best applicants to attend. And I'm not talking about some tier-3 school. Tier-1 schools, including those in the T-20, are throwing money at qualified applicants. 

If you want to be a lawyer, and I mean really want it, then nothing should stop you from pursuing your dreams. Feel free to PM if you have any questions at all related to any aspect of law school.
