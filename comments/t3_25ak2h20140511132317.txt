You can't simply have him relinquish his parental rights unless there's someone to adopt your daughter (usually a step-parent). The state cares about kids having a legal mother and father and unless you marry your boyfriend, your ex agrees, and your new husband agrees to adopt her, then you can't do anything. 

Edit to add: there are some rare and extreme cases (such as extreme violent or sexual abuse) where parental rights could be terminated, but I don't think your situation would rise to that level probably.
