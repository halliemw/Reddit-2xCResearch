I always hated that "they asked for it" excuse. Just because someone asks for something doesn't mean it's appropriate to give it to them. If a 14 year-old asked for a handle of vodka and a pack of cigars, would it be OK to give it to them? No. They're 14, ffs. 

Then there's the fact that it's pretty damned easy to take advantage of young teens. They're lonely and clueless and horny. They're not used to attention and it goes straight to their heads. They don't know all the adult games that get played and easily fall for the cheesiest shit. "You're different, you're special, I haven't felt this way about anyone else..."  They're _just_ mature enough to be sexually appealing to some adults but still young enough in the head not to really understand bullshit. It's up to the adult to say, "No, you may think you want this but you're not ready yet." Not, "Yeah! Easy sex!"
