We are going thru a similar situation and it's only after about a year and half that it's starting to get better. I know it's me, I want to WANT to have sex... but I don't. I mean it's a great idea, but when it comes down to it... 

So I started by giving him Hand jobs and BJ's, because even if I'm not in the mood he still is and I can help with that. When we get the chance we have sexy shower time. 

I understood that it was me, I needed to change, so I did. I started to initiate things more often, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but I tried. The more I tried, the more I wanted it. Are we back to where we were? No, but it's better than where we came from! 

Pick a night, wear something that makes you feel sexy and head out to the front room. Turn off the lights, look him in the eyes and tell him you love him, then turn off the tv/computer and straddle him. If he starts to say something, kiss him and keep kissing him until he shuts up. When he finally does, lead him into the bed room. (or not if want couch sex)

Try, try and try again. Pick your day and keep telling yourself what you're gonna do. Sex is a much mental for women as it is physical, so think about it lots!
