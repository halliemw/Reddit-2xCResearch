I think there are lots of situations when men and women need to be discussed as distinct (just as an aside also remember that there are lots of people in between who don't consider themselves male or female, and they can often feel isolated by the distinction.) 

"Women in X" and "men in X" are both really useful terms, I agree. I think the question is: (when you have a minority group e.g. women) is this distinction the best way to correct/alleviate past issues such as lack of respect/representation for women in the industry? Maybe it is, but I think Neko's position is valid too - maybe with some industries/issues we are at the point where continuing to highlight women as a distinct sub-group in need of special attention, read: assistance (which I guess is the inference here) we are actually hindering their progress of being seen as just a normal part of that larger group.

So I agree with you. It's just interesting to think about the best way to promote equal representation/views of men and women (and everyone else) in particular industries, while also accepting and celebrating difference.
