The fact that the assumption comes up frequently when you two are together hints that you and your boss are around eachother often enough for it to even be a 'thing' to others who don't know you two aren't somehow related. You and your boss may even be giving off a sense of closeness and/or similarity in mannerisms or thinking. Just keep in mind that although you feel awkward, it's something of a compliment to you when compared to people thinking your boss is old enough to be your mother. That must be awkward for your boss to hear constantly, whether or not she is. So yeah, try to look at it in a positive light, at least for you, and maybe reply sometime that while she's like a mother to everyone in the workplace, you can't claim relation but thanks. :)
