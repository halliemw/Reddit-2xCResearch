 the question i always ask in these threads is why does killing people make a person automatically mentally ill? the idea that a person could go out and kill without some form of mental illness is never looked at. even thought we ask our soldiers to do it all the time. this attitude creates a lot of stigma for those with mental illnesses. the persons committing these crimes and going on these sprees might not be traditionally mentally ill, they all seem to be mind fucked , but not in a throw pills at it sort of way. its important to differentiate between a chemical imbalance, and thinking problems, but that is hard to boil down in a sound bite.
