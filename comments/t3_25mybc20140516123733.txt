At night just water. If I screw up and have to take it in the morning, I take it with breakfast to help mitigate the heartburn. I will say that I've always been prone to heartburn. Stress gives me heartburn. Not eating regularly gives me heartburn. Waking up too early and staying in bed instead of getting up gives me heartburn. Coffee gives me heartburn (actually, that one is fairly common). I don't get it every day, but certain behaviors will cause it. Not spicy food though, which is great.
