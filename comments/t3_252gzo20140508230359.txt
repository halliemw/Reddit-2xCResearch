Women don't feel comfortable ordering a big steak? Fuck, I guess I've been doing it wrong for years.

It's interesting, though, because when I hear about other women's frustrations with restaurants I almost never experienced them myself... Because I'm a lesbian, and without a man at the table issues like "who does the waiter automatically hand the bill to" totally dissipate. (In the 2 1/2 years I dated my ex-girlfriend, we were asked if we wanted split bills every single time. It's cute!)

Honestly, I think most restaurant issues can be easily solved by encouraging waitstaff to perceive of things ever so slightly differently: the person who orders the wine tastes the wine. The person who asks for the bill at the end of the meal will likely be paying the bill. Etc., etc.
