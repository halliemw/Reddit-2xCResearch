I cramped a lot for the first month and a half, with sharp pains during PMS and menstruation. Slowly, as my body got used to it, the pain faded, and after about four months there was none at all.  Give it a little while for your body to adjust, and if you are still feeling sharp pains, maybe see your doc, but the pain after (and during) insertion is normal. Don't worry, you'll be okay :)
