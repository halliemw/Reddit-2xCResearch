I think you're probably in good health, you don't bring up any health issues. However, I say go see a doctor for a routine physical. With your unfamiliarity with doctors, I think now is the best time to introduce yourself to that environment. Almost all of us have something go wrong with out bodies at some point, and probably one day you'll REALLY need to go to the doctor. If that day comes, I think you'll be better off if you've experienced a doctors visit in adulthood. That way you'll only have the "arg what's wrong with me can they fix it" anxiety instead of the additional "arg what the hell is this place I haven't done this in 30 years anxiety."
