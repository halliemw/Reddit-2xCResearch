I definitely agree. And--it's high school, which is an educational experience, so I understand preparing us for a professional environment. But it's also a social experience, and nobody wants to be that girl who wears her skirt all the way at her knees (which would have looked downright dowdy on me). And yes! We should be allowed to wear clothes that flatter us, not clothes that, like my uniform, made us feel like an unattractive box.
