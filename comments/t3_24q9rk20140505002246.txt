It's an incredibly fucked up world view and it's why many women rely on the " I have a boyfriend" thing. I've actually changed it to telling people I'm married (I'm not, but I do wear my mother's engagement ring that my dad gave her) as men would say " so? you're not tied down" which would also happen even when I stepped it up to saying I'm engaged. it's fucked up. there is also the fact that it can be scary and feel unsafe to reject a person- what if they are the type to hurt/stalk/rape you if they are rejected? how would one even know ahead of time? you don't. It's a schrodinger's cat type of situation.
