I have gotten annoyed at the fact any woman in a prominent role is called a 'strong female character' .
   Apparently simply being visible is enough to define a woman as strong, as if it is against the norm for a woman to do anything. 

I think it is much easier to define a weak female character, and then work it out form there.
