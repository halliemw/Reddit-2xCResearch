Thanks for the info! It sounds like you know what you're talking about. Gyn? Nurse?

3.5 years from now I might be thinking of having babies in the nearish future (<5 years certainly), so I'd probably opt for a shorter term birth control at that point. So it's good to know that just getting it removed (probably) won't hurt so bad.
