I think the public service is always a great resource for issues such as these as promoting professionalism is part of what they do.

[Here's some excerpts from the Australian Public Service (APS) "Respect Summary Guide"](http://www.apsc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/7872/Summary-guide-2011-Final.pdf)

*What are harassment and bullying?* 

* Workplace harassment entails offensive, belittling or threatening behaviour directed at an individual or group of APS employees. The behaviour is unwelcome, unsolicited, usually unreciprocated and often repeated. 

* Bullying is a form of harassment and is also a failure to show respect and courtesy. 

* Workplace bullying can also take the form of abusive group behaviour (sometimes called ‘mobbing’). 

*Workplace harassment and bullying can be:* 

* intended: where actions were intended to humiliate, offend, intimidate or distress, whether or not the behaviour did in fact have that effect, or 

* unintended: which although not intended to humiliate, offend, intimidate or distress, did cause and should reasonably have been expected to cause that effect. **In the case of sexual harassment, it only needs to be shown that a reasonable person would anticipate the possibility that the behaviour would offend, humiliate or intimidate.** 

*Why should you focus on it?* 

* The culture of an organisation can either lift agency performance or inhibit the achievement of outcomes and the demonstration of appropriate values, attitudes and behaviours. 

* Harassment and bullying have a negative impact on performance and, regardless of whether 
the behaviour occurs across the organisation or in isolated pockets, it often reflects unhealthy organisational and management practices. 

* Harassment and bullying often coincide with high levels of absenteeism, poor performance, 
high turnover and low organisational commitment. 
What is the cost of harassment and bullying to your agency? 

* Harassment and bullying are costly and impact on individuals, the team and the organisation 

* In 2009-10, around 17% of APS employees surveyed indicated that they had been harassed or bullied in the past 12 months 

* Bullying constitutes a significant risk to the health, safety and wellbeing of the individual and 
can lead to serious psychological injury 

* Your organisation’s reputation can be damaged through adverse media coverage and your organisation will not be regarded as an ‘employer of choice’ 

* Costs of dealing with complaints and litigation are high—and may include payment of damages 

* Direct salary costs, workers’ compensation and lost productivity arising from workplace bullying have a significant cost for the Australian Public Service 

* Workers’ compensation claims for psychological injury are the most expensive type of claim 

* In the Commonwealth jurisdiction, workers’ compensation claims where harassment or bullying is the cause of the injury make up 45% of all ‘mental stress’ claims

*What behaviour is expected in the workplace?* 

Employers and employees have shared obligations for creating respectful and courteous workplaces. 

Employers want a productive workforce that manages its performance and achieves results. 

Employees want to work in a place where: 

* they know what is expected of them 

* the workplace is safe and they are treated fairly 

* their skills and contribution are recognised and valued 

* training and development support career progression 

* they can work harmoniously with others.
