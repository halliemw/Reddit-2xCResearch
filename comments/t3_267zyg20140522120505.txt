Hey, thanks. :) I appreciate you taking the time to answer.

It's like it's not even the same person. When he was here in the US, things were fantastic. Of course he still had the same ADHD and anxieties, but being with him in person I fully accepted him and didn't want to change anything about him. I only wanted him to know that I love him either way, and I would do whatever I could to make it work long distance. 

I'll be in the Netherlands indefinitely. Without being too specific, I got hired by a European institution (I have dual US/Italian citizenship) and this has been my dream job--literally, my end goal--since I was 14. I am SO PROUD that I achieved this.

I'm pretty sure if I ring him, we can go out together and I'm sure he will be able to rekindle things with me... but I might not be able to forget all of this. How can I forget this? It's probably not a good idea.
