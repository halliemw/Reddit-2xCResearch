I have used the disposables, the Mooncup and Diva. The disposables are messier because they don't have a heavy structure. Between the Moon and the Diva, Diva wins hands down. It has some ribbing around the bottom of the cup making it easy to grab onto. My Moon didn't have that and the longer stem on the bottom was painful. I have had the Diva for over a year and sent my sister one for Christmas. Saves you a tonne over a year!
