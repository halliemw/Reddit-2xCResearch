My experience with airbnb was awesome :) But make sure to read the reviews! Rent properties from people with established reputations. 

I've always gone for studios/apartments when using airbnb because I have the budget for it, but I'm sure you'll be fine as long as you make sure to check the people out. Check the areas, read up and see if the neighbourhood is safe, and trust your instincts.
