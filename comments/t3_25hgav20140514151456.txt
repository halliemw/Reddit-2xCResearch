they might not want to make it about race, but people are free to make their own guesses.  Reading the link I posted, sounds like other kids were "dancing provacatively" later in the night.  So my theory for why they were singled out still works for me.  They might not have thought people knew they were together, but an outsider often sees the subtle clues in the way people react to each others movements and conversation.  Could be the "ogling" dads were trying to figure out for sure they were together.
