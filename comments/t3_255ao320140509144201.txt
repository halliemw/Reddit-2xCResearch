New York City! I get it a bit less these days, now that I've developed resting bitch face and have headphones in. It used to be pretty bad. I tend to get catcalled by the people loitering on the street in front of/near subway stations. I think it's that they're bored and have nothing better to do. 

I used to never get catcalled when I lived in California. Mostly because I think I lived in a rather well-to-do neighborhood and spent a lot of time there. Also, I spent a lot more time in the car. So now that I'm taking public transit and walking everywhere, I'm more exposed to that sort of thing. 

I end up usually saying something like "that's incredibly rude. Don't do that ever again." or "I hope no one speaks to your mother the way you spoke to me." or if they're doing something like masturbating at/in front of me, "I hope your mother never sees you like this because I'm sure she raised you better than this."
