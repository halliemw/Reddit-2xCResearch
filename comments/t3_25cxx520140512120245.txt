One time I was walking downtown by myself to catch the train home.  I passed by an older man who told me I'm too pretty to frown.  Sorry dude, that's just my fucking face.  I never have an actual response to it.  I just end up giving people a dumbfounded look.  Sometimes they get the message; usually they don't.
