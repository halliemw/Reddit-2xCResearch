I think you're right about the 'perception' of femininity. 

I've mainly had short hair since I was a teenager, and people often asked if I was gonna grow my hair. I grew my hair long after university, just to see what it would be like. 

Turns out, once I had it all cut off again after a couple of years, everyone (male and female) said I suited it much better than long hair!
