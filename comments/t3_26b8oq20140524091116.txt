No periods for 3 years. None. On advice from my gyno I've been skipping the iron/placebo pills for three years and just going on to the next pack. Before that my periods were unbearable, painful, would cause me to throw up and a couple times I actually passed out from the pain. It was better when I started BC, but still very painful on those placebo/iron days. Skipping the iron pills has changed my life.
I feel like a real human being for the first time. Bless you birth control!!
