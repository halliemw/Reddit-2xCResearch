Sure: read the discussions, learn from them, and take what you learn out into the world. That's fine! Desirable, even. I have other subreddits I visit occasionally, to learn about other people's perspectives (I like to compare /r/predaddit to /r/babybumps, for instance).

And the occasional comment is fine, as long as it's thoughtful and does not dominate. The problem is that if 80% of people commenting on 2X are male, then you lose the core of what it's supposed to be. 

...I would be uncomfortable with posts being automatically mirrored elsewhere, without the OP's personal consent. Some posts are personal, or are photographs, etc. I know that 2X isn't a private space by any stretch of the imagination, but I would prefer to the material posted here to stay here unless the owner of that information wants it to go elsewhere.
