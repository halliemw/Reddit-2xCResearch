As a man, I find this to be a big part of the issue. I want to treat women with the utmost respect, but there is a certain age range for which I can't figure out which is going to be the least offensive of "woman," "girl," "lady," "female" or any other possible term I could use. 

As best as I can tell, it varies from woman to woman as to which they prefer, and I try to follow the terms that a specific woman will use to refer to themselves, if I can remember it. I definitely wish there were an appropriate informal catchall like "guys" to use for women.
