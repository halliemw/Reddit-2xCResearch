Survivors have the right to file a police report, but universities have a responsibility to ensure a safe campus from sexual discrimination (which sexual assault falls under according to the Dear Colleague letter and clarifications on Title IX). If a survivor chooses not to pursue criminal charges with the police, the university still needs to investigate and ensure that their students (including the survivor and perpetrator, potentially) are safe and able to live and study in an environment that is not hindering their education based on sex or gender.
