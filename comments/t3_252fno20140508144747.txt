I think having the flair wont do much. Some people wont use it, and those who do may not use it seriously. I think it would be best to see how this community forms over the next few weeks before making changes like that. Will it stay a subreddit for women's issues or will it turn into something like a /r/AskWomen /r/politics hybrid. 

Also, what would the flair encourage? I'd imagine a mentality of immediately preferring the opinion of someone with a particular flair would develop.
