Well sure. But here's the thing- someone who says they are prolife means that they are judging someone who isn't. They think women who get pregnant should have to continue the pregnancy. However that woman got pregnant, even if they tried their utmost best to avoid it, it's their "responsibility" to keep going as is.

Whereas someone prochoice (or who doesn't care) is saying whatever you want, usually within some personal framework that is a lot more flexible. (Most people who are prochoice are only so up to a certain point in pregnancy, usually viability.)

You can be prochoice and never want an abortion no matte the circumstances. That's totally normal, I know plenty of people who are prochoice and yet wouldn't terminate a personal pregnancy (or in some weird situation, help someone else do so) no matter what- they really want to have a child if the opportunity presents itself.

It's also important to consider the audience- if you're selling your idea, and there's no buyers, it's not the market's fault. If you get downvoted for an opinion it's not like there's a conspiracy among people and everyone involved is chatting in another private sub to downvote- if anyone would have been invited to such a thing, I probably would. Never seen a hint of anything like that here.

FWIW, I upvoted this post so more people see it. But it's not because I agree- it's because I think you added to the conversation. I just don't think the conversation can be steered to where you want it to be.
