I discussed the shot with my gyno but I think for me and my schedule it would seriously be more of a hassle. Like I said I'm in grad school and I work a full time OVERNIGHT job so scheduling appointments during the day blows. I still think I'm going to go through with the implant, as long as my insurance covers it, but I just want to know what I could possibly getting into. I realize that its just like any medication where it affects everyone differently. But thanks for your input. I really wanted to hear from overweight women because it seems like only the really thin women are the ones whose period disappears.
