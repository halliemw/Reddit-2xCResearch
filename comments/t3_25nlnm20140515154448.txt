How's your relationship with your doctor? Do you feel like she [he] listens to your concerns and is happy to explore other options? If so, this sounds like a good question for her [him]. 

I'll try give you some information on the options available so that you know what to read up on and what questions to ask:

* The pills you have use different progesterone analogs. Both the pills you tried contain Ethinyl Estradiol (estrogen analog), although Minastrin already has fairly low levels of this compound.... you could try a pill with mestranol in it, although this compound is metabolized to ethinyl estradiol anyways.

* If it is an estrogen sensitivity, you could try a progestin-only pill. Note that these require more strict adherence to taking them at the same time.

* Another option could be to go with a more localized dose, such as Nuva Ring. 

* The hormonal IUD (Mirena in the US) is an option. It doesn't have estrogen analogs, but on the other hand, it cannot be removed without medical supervision, so if you do have adverse affects, it isn't as easy as stopping the pill. It's probably an alternative that you consider only after successful use of progestin-only pills.

* The best non-hormonal reversible method of birth control is the copper IUD. I use this method of birth control. If you want to avoid hormones all together, this is probably your best bet. I'm happy to answer questions you may have about it.
