Its not true that most people who have HPV have strains that are non wart causing, instead most people who have HPV do not have warts as a symptom. Almost all strains of HPV can cause genital warts (there are some strains that are more common than others though). Ultimately, you control how you perceive the situation, I would say they're only stigmatized by those who know nothing about the virus and don't care to inform themselves, as is the case for most things. I do not think you should give any weight to those opinions, because honestly, they're wrong. Flat out wrong. I think you need to take a step back. It makes me really sad that you're basically saying you would want a severely increased rate of cervical cancer rather than a cosmetic inconvenience where literally only the people who know about it are those that you are closest to and love.

That said, from what you've written it really doesn't sound like warts. Also most doctors tend to default to the most common assumption, and by far warts are more common than any other bump you would have on your labia. To truly know if its a wart you need to look with a microscope at the blood vessel structure, which you definitely cannot do with a picture. You're in diagnostic limbo as much as the entire sexually active world is in diagnostic limbo. Again, most people who have HPV don't know they have it and CAN'T know they have it since there is no approved testing method for men.
