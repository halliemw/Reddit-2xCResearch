Firstly it's 2014 so not sure why you're saying she finished working in 2013. So both have had 41 year careers. Do we even know if Keller had the same wage the whole time or not? If his wage increased **because** of his years at the company then there was a reason for the difference. If not then there isn't a profound edge when it comes to time spent at the company. Before starting the job Bill Keller had 19 years experience at the NYT and Abramson had 17 years.

Of course they're going to have different backgrounds just like Baquet who's replacing her. They are different people just like with any other job. Baquet had 15 years experience at the NYT. 

You haven't proved that Keller had longer experience in journalism at all. 

If you're so keen on wanking off to your old economics teacher then go and Google his/her (as if there's any doubt) image and stop twisting facts.
