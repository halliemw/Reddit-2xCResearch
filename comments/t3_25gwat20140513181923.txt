I told someone I know who is out of the friend group, and he completely blamed me for putting myself in the situation at all. Kept questioning how I didn't realize until he was in me. Didn't believe it. Said I must of been touching him or something. I was asleep in fetal facing the opposite direction and he was on his back.


Now I really never want  to tell anyone ever.  :-/ I knew no one would understand.
