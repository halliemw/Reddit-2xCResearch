> maybe you are not familiar with eating disorders (and i am going to assume you are not) but the notion of counting calories is like 90% what eating disorders are. 

Far more than you can imagine. Physically seen one person die from one. And my impression of reasons behind them is very different than yours, clearly.

> measuring is a HUGE part of anorexia - someone with an eating disorder becomes OBSESSED and fixated on the number of calories, weaning it down to a really unhealthy amount, they become obsessed with numbers on a scale and it becomes such an obsession that it stops them from seeing their body or their health as a real thing

Again, if the assumption of "Being taught how to measure increases the probability of cutting under the starvation barrier, followed closely by anorexia and similar eating disorders" is a correct one, then the suggestion is clearly bad. But this assumption has only been stated so far, not justified. I do not see any reason to believe that it is correct.
