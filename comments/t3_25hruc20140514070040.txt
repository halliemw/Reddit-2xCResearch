As you move further and further away from high school and college, it becomes a lot harder to meet people you relate to. It is not a reflection on your age or the value you have as a woman. It is just how life is, if you aren't surrounded by the people you want to be around, you most likely aren't going to find someone you want to be around for a very long time.

But don't give up hope, it just requires a bit more effort on your part.
