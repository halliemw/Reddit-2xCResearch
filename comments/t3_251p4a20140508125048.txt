That's how I landed in several of the subs I subscribe to now, most of them actually, with the few exceptions being crosslinked in sidebars to the ones I landed in originally. (not saying it's bad, just that a LOT of people do this, sometimes thinking actual discussions about things are in "joke" subreddits or are satire rather than... well, actual discussions.)
