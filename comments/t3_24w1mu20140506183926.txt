I understand this feeling. What it comes down to is this: a lot of people don't feel fulfilled by any kind of stereotypical "success" because it's not what they specifically want. For example, someone who truly wants to live in NYC and be a professional ballet dancer more than anything in the world might feel very unfulfilled by being a highly-paid lawyer in Atlanta, even if that sounds like a very "successful" life to most people. 

The first thing to try is to see if you can make yourself happier by doing things you enjoy and find fulfillment in outside of work. Most tech company employees I know do this. Sometimes the thing is something they wish they could do as a career, but either a) it's not at all a realistic goal for them in that sense, or b) they're not willing to make the sacrifices necessary in order to do it full time. Other times that thing is just a hobby they wouldn't really want to do full time, but it's something they really love doing. I think the key here is for it to be something that gives you a sense of accomplishment, rather than just a sense of relaxation.

If you still feel unhappy and hate the idea of spending 40-100 hours a week at your job, then I think the next step is figuring out if there is some specific thing you'd rather be doing. If there is, then figure out whether you want it enough to make whatever sacrifices would be necessary for that. For example, if your main passion in life is photography and more than anything you  would love to be a full-time wedding photographer, you might have to give up on the idea of owning a house in a "desirable area" (especially if you work at the HQ of that particular tech company and live anywhere remotely near that). To some people, having a fancy house or a car they can brag about is worth a job that bores them. For others, it's not. But often, you can't have it both ways.
