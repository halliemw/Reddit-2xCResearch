Leaving your kids potentially unattended for up to 10 hours (babysitter was not expecting a long shift!) could easily count as neglect depending on the age of the kids involved, which counts as child abuse.

In either case, CPS is mandated to do what's best for the kid, so if they decide the parent is fine, no harm done.
