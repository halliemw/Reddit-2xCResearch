>* Saying things like "I couldn't date a woman who doesn't shave." or "Women shouldn't dye their hair, natural looks better." or "She should smile more." These phrases are all about taking away a woman's right to manage her own body, even if the men don't think of it that way.

No, that's called having a preference.

>* Disparaging women for having many sexual partners. It's no business of anyone's how much sex women have, and it has no impact on their value as a person.

This is far too broad of a statement, it has no impact on their value as a person, however it may have an impact on their value as a dating partner( and I use this statement regardless of gender)

I think a decent number of these are either incorrect or oversimplified to an extreme degree.
