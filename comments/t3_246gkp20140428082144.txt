What is the source of this stigma? Real parents are your biological parents and not just the people who raised you. We can justify that adoptive parents are replacements for biological parents that are unavailable or unsuitable for raising their children. But what is the justification for deliberately creating children with no connection to family? It is not for the benefit of the child that they were created, but for the benefit of parents who could not have children in the normal manner. To justify creating children in this manner we need to deny the importance of family ties and claim that social ties are only important.
