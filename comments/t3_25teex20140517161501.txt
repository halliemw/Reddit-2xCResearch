I can't speak on PCOS as I'd never heard about it until now, however I can relate to the depression. Long story short I've gone from debating on if o should take others out with my suicide or do it cleanly to where I am now engaged to the live off my life, expecting a son, and I hadn't needed a drink or meds in over a year.

When in the depths of depression I know that it seems like there's nothing to look forward to and your just tired of trying to make through the day (never mind trying to imagine where the strength will come from to make it through the next). Just please, and I know others will come in too, please talk to someone, anyone! You only get to live this life once. You need to find what makes you happy in your life and just throw everything you have into it. 

If you need someone to listen feel free to message me. Keep up the work, it sounds like you've had to work hard and deal with a lot to get where you are now. The work isn't over yet but there will be something that will make it easier and tolerable in the future.

Edit: fixed auto correct of PC IS to PCOS
