I take antidepressants as well, but that did not exclude me. Prolonged drug use, smoking, and physical illnesses that can be passed on to your children are negative in the eyes of recipients. I am 5'3, but that did not seem to bother the couple who chose me. 
The whole thing is that you're selling yourself in the purest sense of the word possible: are YOU an attractive genetic specimen? College education is not a must, but it is preferred, as intelligence is considered to be about 40% inherited if I am not mistaken, and being in college is supposed to prove higher intelligence, work ethic, etc, etc (though I do not believe this myself.)
