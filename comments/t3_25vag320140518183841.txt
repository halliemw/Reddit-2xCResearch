I agree anecdotes are utterly worthless, but I am confused that you state it after making a sweeping generalization (which are based on anecdotes).

Science is *always* worth arguing about. This is also just one study, it is the correct scientific process to be extra suspicious of the conclusion until further similar studies in the next year or two come to the same conclusion. For example, while I haven't yet had time to read the journal, one part stuck out to me: 

 "The researchers found that cycle shifts in women’s preferences were more pronounced in studies that relied on an extremely long estimation of a woman’s fertility window (up to 12 days) when women are actually highly unlikely to become pregnant outside of a six-day period"

As far as I am aware the previous links between cycles and changes in behaviour are to do with hormones. Is The length of time you are able to get pregnant and the length of time your cycle is affecting your hormones the same? for all women? every cycle? I am not suggesting I belive this to be the case - I do not have sufficient knowlege in that field of biology to give an answer, But this is one example of an oversight that could invalidate the entire study, and why multiple studies are needed before the conclusion is adopted fully.



Look at science previously on Pot to see why this is important, every few years a new harmful effect is found, and every few years later is disproven by similar studies. Many of the things pot has been "found to cause" are actually now being treated with medical pot.

You'll have much more luck convincing men to listen to you if you don't attack the entire gender while debating, its unnecessary, inflammitory and insulting for the rest of us who've been on your side the entire time.
