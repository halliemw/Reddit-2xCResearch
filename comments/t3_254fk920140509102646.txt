I can also confirm this. Goldie blox is a lot of fun for toddler exploration.. but with a child in the recommended age range, they will quickly get annoyed that the holes aren't tight enough and their designs that should work, don't work.

The result of this is that the primary design is the only thing that works well and thus the set feels very limiting.
