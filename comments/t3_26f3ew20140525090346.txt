Some of this will be conversation-specific, but usually you can keep using whatever you've found out and just ask for more details.

Ask why they picked whatever they're in school for, or about what they do at work. 

Find a talkative person and get coffee with them or something. Right after doing all the normal get to know you questions is a good time to ask. Really notice how they're keeping the conversation going. Watching other people is the best way to get better at this stuff. Good luck!
