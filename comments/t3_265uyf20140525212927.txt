I  had skyla  inserted about a month ago.  the  cramps  were  horrible  the first week and  now I get  horrible cramps around my period. I  went from never having  cramps  to needing a  portable  heating pad on call.

 however, I  love it.  totally worth it so far.
 I've heard that the cramps  subside after a few months,  so  I'm sticking with it!
