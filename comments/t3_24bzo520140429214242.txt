I think the article was trying to highlight the fact that girls are considered to be "worse" at math and science.

Also, women don't end up in as many stem related fields which shows that there is some type of disparity going on. When we assume that girls don't do as well maybe there is a correlation that they can't get jobs in those fields.

That's where I think we really need to help girls. STEM does not need embody male dominated fields. That would probably also assist in the income disparity between men and women. STEM jobs pay better
