Yeah lets talk real talk cos I have been there. He remembers, he's a lying sack of shit trying to put blame on you and lets be honest alcohol doesn't make you act unlike yourself it amplifies the real you, it takes away inhibitions. This is what this guy is underneath and if you stay it will l get worse because he will know he can get away with that shit. Don't make my mistake and try and salvage it, it only gets worse. Don't make excuses for him to your family, they already know the truth and they won't forget either. It's time to get out now!
Edit: Also don't be embarrassed, it's his damn problem not yours. Don't let him perpetuate a cycle of abuse through "love".
