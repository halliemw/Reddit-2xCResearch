Back out of this hellish mess. And do it quickly before she gets pissed that she spent ten minutes making you a glittered-out invitation.

Take her out for a drink or call her up. Have a tactful conversation where you tell her you were honored to be asked as a bridesmaid, but would feel more comfortable attending the wedding as a guest now due to unforeseen financial difficulties you're having. Assure her you will still do what you can to contribute to her special day. Tell her if she would like, you would be happy to take on a lesser role, like Guestbook or Reader.

Hopefully she'll understand. If she gets mad, apologize once briefly for the inconvenience and give her a cooling off period. If her anger persists, just ignore it and go about your life...she may come back around before the wedding. She may not be a great friend anyways if she gets mad about something like this, so it's up to you to decide what you want to do with the friendship from there.
