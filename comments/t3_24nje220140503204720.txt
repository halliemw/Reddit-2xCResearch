I don't have a whole lot to add, but as a girl who had no one to talk to about this stuff, I would say make sure your responses to her questions are neutral. Make her feel like it's a totally normal thing to wonder about (because it is, though you seem aware of that). It's already going to be weird for her to ask questions, but if she feels like everyone asks that stuff and it's totally okay to not know and then ask, she will probably be more comfortable about the whole thing.
