New male subscriber, found out this sub exists from the default announcement. This is the only newly defaulted sub I've consistently visited because I think the level of discussion here is far above what goes on on most of Reddit, and it's definitely exposed me to new ideas and perspectives. Hopefully things stay that way as the community deals with the inevitable growth of being default, but so far I find the discussions here enlightening and the community supportive and welcoming.

I also think the users/mods have done a good job downvoting, reporting and removing bad material; I usually arrive late to discussions and haven't encountered many trolls or misogynists because their comments are either gone or downvoted into oblivion. It still sucks that such comments are more numerous than before and that they need to be removed/downvoted at all.

Overall, I'm happy to have found this sub and probably wouldn't have if it hadn't gone default, but I can totally see where those adamantly against being default are coming from, especially those getting unwanted PMs. I obviously can't comment on whether it's good or bad on the whole that this place is now default since I don't have to deal with many of the consequences.
