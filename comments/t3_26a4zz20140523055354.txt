It would drive me insane to work with someone like that. I'm fuming over this one incident with a stranger. Can't imagine dealing with that on a regular basis. I'm just thinking, what happens when these guys move in with a woman? Or marry her? Or have children with her? Do they think they won't have to deal with it?
