I think that rather than being against abortion as a concept, it's more about being against irresponsible behavior. Which is a logical position IMO. I'm against serial abortions because they should not be necessary - we invented contraception for a reason, damnit. Sexual education is lacking, and universal healthcare actually tend to reduce the ratio of abortions per capita. But then I'm against refusing an abortion for a 15-year-old girl, or a young woman who was raped, or who just knows she can't afford it, finances- or health-wise.
