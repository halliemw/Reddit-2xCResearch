Where in Canada are you located? I'm in Toronto - please PM if you are too and I will do what I can to help you. I know this must be extremely stressful for you, but abortion is legal in Canada and there are many places that can help you. Start by Googling abortion/women's clinics in your area. You are going to be okay!
