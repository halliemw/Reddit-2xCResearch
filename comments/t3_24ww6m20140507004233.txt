I agree with the philosophy, but on principle I can't bring myself to say "sorry" to someone begging me for money. Personally, I'm not sorry that I'm not giving them money. 

I think you should say "nope, move along" and maintain eye contact with them and look as though you are fucking serious. If they ask you against or say anything , reiterate " I said no, so move along. ". 

Also- carry a tactical retractable baton, and/or pepper spray, and or a large knife. My mom kept one under her drivers seat for just suck occasions. I remember when I was like three a homeless dude knocked on her window with me in the passenger seat- before I knew it she had pulled an 8" serrated blade out and was tapping her driver side window and repeating that she told him to move along. 

Maintain eye contact. 
Don't waver. 
Dismiss them. 
Don't apologize.
Don't antagonize.
