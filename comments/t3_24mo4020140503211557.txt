Along with other suggestions here I just want to say don't be afraid to reach out to a women's shelter (like YWCA), if you want you can just talk to them about what's going on and they can offer you advice on different options you have and the support they can give you. They're truly helpful in assisting you in setting up sustainable plans for a future that's independent.
