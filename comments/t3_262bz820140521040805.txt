I'm a software engineer, and I live about 200 yards away from Apple's main campus.  I watched the first episode of that show, and concluded that Hollywood knows precisely squat about the world I live  in.

>I know a bunch of people who live in "geek houses" just like the ones in which the main characters reside-- and that house even looks exactly like the actual ones do, right down to the era of house and the objects contained therein.

Nah.  There were a handful of startups back in the day that consisted of groups of guys living and working together.  Lighthouse Designs, which is where Jonathan Schwartz got his start, springs to mind.  They were not, however, living in a sitcom.

The "geek  houses" that still exist are nothing like the nonsense these scriptwriters are pulling out of their asses.

>comically out-of-touch rich execs 

I've met several of Apple's senior VPs, and the last thing I would ever say to describe them is "out of touch".  Those guys are scary smart, and they work incredibly hard. 

> angel investors

Angels tend to know their shit, since they made their own money and are investing out of their own pockets.  VCs tend to be management consultant douchebags who have been entrusted with other people's money to risk.
