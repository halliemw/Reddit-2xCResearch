I just had surgery in December, after 9 years of paps/colpos and biopsies - paps were 3-monthly at one point, never gone more than a year between. It's not fun, but I've learned not to let it stress me.

Fuck. I just remembered that I'm probably due to go back in, but I've moved so my doctor can't contact me... Thanks for the reminder :)
