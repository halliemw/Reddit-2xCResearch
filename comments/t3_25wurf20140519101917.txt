I know I'm weird. I just try to be the good kind of weird. XD

But thanks for bringing this up. You and a couple other posters mentioned body language, and I kept thinking, "But I think I'm okay at reading body language; I'm always hyper-sensitive to tone of voice and things like that," and not getting anywhere.

But then I started to think about the kind of body language I send out. And I think there's definitely room for improvement there. I highly doubt that I come across as warm, physically. Probably more reserved and standoffish, for a variety of reasons. So thank you for helping me to come to this realization!
