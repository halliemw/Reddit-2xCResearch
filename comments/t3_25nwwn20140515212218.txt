It's not a backhanded compliment, though it's probably something to avoid saying because one never knows how anyone else views their weight or weight loss or why any kind of loss (or gain for that matter) may have happened.  

Personally, I LOVE it when people tell me I've lost weight.  Yes I have and I feel damn good about it!  I think it's nice when others notice.  It feels motivating and supportive.  Though I can definitely see how that might not be the case for others.  It's really one of those things that shouldn't be commented on unless you know the person well and their circumstances and how they feel about the subject.
