A 17 year old girl vs a 30 something big guy with his friend. Not going to do well with those odds. At the time I didn't even see it, I was told about it by my mother and brother. 

I did how ever approach the guy who groped me in the street. He screamed in my face and told me to get lost before he loses it. I'm not so quiet about it, turns out neither was he.
