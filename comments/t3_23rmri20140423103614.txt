If you're worried about offending then just go. While there be sure to thank the admins for their work, etc. Call out the fact that you're there to say thank you and not because you're "one of them". I'm an admin and I'd be wondering, just as much as you, why you're there esp because you probably get paid a lot more and don't do anything I do.
