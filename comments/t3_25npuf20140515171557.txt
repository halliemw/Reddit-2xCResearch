There are at-home laser-removal options that work pretty much as well as professional services. They're considerably less expensive, but still pretty pricey if you're on a limited budget. Some of the cheapest are around a couple hundred.

Otherwise, shaving and just realizing that most people don't notice or care is a good option if you can achieve it, or depilatories like others suggested might help.
