I know it's not the same thing at all, but I also recently had a monstrous task ahead of me. I was studying for a professional exam, similar to the Bar or medical boards, and I knew I had to study at least 3 hours a day, every single day, from the beginning of December until April 30th. At first, I was completely overwhelmed - how can I possible study that much for so long? How can I give up my social life? When will I have time to do anything? I was seriously stressed out and doubting that I could do it because studying that much for so long seemed like such an impossible task. I was looking at the next 5 months of my life and all I saw were 400 hours that I needed to fit in for studying, on top of my fulltime job.

Then someone gave me the advice I gave you. Take it one day at a time. So every day, I pretended it was a new day and told myself, "Hey, you're going to study for an hour then take a break. Then another hour, then a break. And then you'll study that third hour and be totally free for the rest of the day." After a few months, I was able to do my studying in a three hour block of time. I stopped worrying about my studying the next day, and the next day, and the next day - I just focused on what I needed to do *today*.

There were days I didn't get my three hours in. There were days I was drained and didn't study at all. But instead of dwelling on the fact that I had failed, I used it as motivation to try harder tomorrow. I looked back and saw all the days that I *did* study and told myself if I could do it for all those days, then one more day wouldn't kill me.

And I *know* that you can do it too. Take each day as it comes and treat it as a new day to change your life. Don't worry about what's going to happen on the future and how far you may need to go. Just today.
