Not that it really solves your issue in question, but you might want to look into long-term birth control like a copper IUD. Depending on the brand and some specific medical factors, they can be effective for 5-10 years, by which point you would be at the "appropriate" age to be permanently sterilized.

Personally I don't think it's fair or reasonable that doctors won't respect you about this elective procedure, but if you're looking to spare yourself the frustration of travelling far/trying to convince doctors/doing a lot of paperwork, you may find this to be a somewhat satisfactory alternative for the short-term.
