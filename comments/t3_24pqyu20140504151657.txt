My life is a fairy tale. It's just not a Disney fairy tale, it's mine. There's loss, hardship, and pain. But that's what makes everything else so damn good.

I think if you redefine specifically what it is that makes you happy and gives you pleasure, and then purposefully take steps to incorporate those things into your reality, you will find that you can create your own "happily ever after".
