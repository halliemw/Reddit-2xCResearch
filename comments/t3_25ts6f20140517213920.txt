People also poop in the nice department stores. I was in a Myer (reasonably up-market) in Melbourne, Australia deciding which stupidly expensive clothes to try on. Back in the daaaaay. We made our way to the change-rooms (pretty fancy) only to be greeted by a giant turd near the door. **You shall not pass!**

We noped out of there, but when we walked past an hour later Turdzilla was still chilling, all like 'Sup, guys, I'm pretty comfortable, so Imma spread out. A lot.'
