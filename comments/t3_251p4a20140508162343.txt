I actually agree with you. Adding /r/oneY as a default would have been a nice balance, and avoided this feeling an awful lot like tokenism. There ARE designated male spaces (and trans*, and so on) on reddit; adding ONLY a woman-focused sub to the defaults inherently casts the remaining not-labelled subs as "male" rather than "neutral." 

Although I will clarify that TwoX has a long history of intentional inclusion; this isn't a sub that excludes anyone except trolls.
