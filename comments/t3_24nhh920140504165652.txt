Yeah, male isn't being used as a noun here, it's being used as an adjective, so fail bolding.

In fact, even in your own comment you managed to get it right for a second: "**society** gives"

Then, you went and got all confused again the very next sentence. You can disagree that the patriarchy exists, that's a possible stance but if you're going to do that at least know what you're disagreeing with. The definition of the patriarchy is not an *accusation* against MEN, it's an *explanation* of the way SOCIETY is. 

The definition says SOCIETY, you read MEN. Not sure why you see those as synonymous.
