You start with:

>He's really incredible, he motivates me to be better and loves me with all my imperfections; he's handsome, funny, charming, super smart, everything I want in a long term partner and then some more!

Then you go to:

>G is understandably uncomfortable with my ppredicament, so to make him feel more comfortable I've alienated myself from my life long male friends

>G also gets jealous when I talk to men.

and

>G likes to point out when I sit without my legs crossed or start discussing the NFL Draft, and it really wreaks havoc on my identity and confidence.

Are you sure that he's everything you want in a long term partner? You've pandered to his insecurities, alienated your friends so no one will be there to help you if things don't work out, and you've admitted that he is destroying your confidence and is *still not happy.* This man is NOT "happy with all your imperfections" like you insist, because to him, your lack of femininity is an imperfection, and instead of swallowing it, he's forced you away from a support network other than himself and made you feel like the only way he'll be happy is if you change your entire demeanor, i.e. yourself. This relationship carries all the earmarks of a manipulative and emotionally abusive relationship. There are other handsome and smart men out there that won't put you down for who you are. I would run now when things are still relatively easy to get out of.

Btw, the only man I've been around that got jealous when I talked to men was my stalker, and we were never together. Just some food for thought.
