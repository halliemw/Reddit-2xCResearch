It makes me sad to think that you would think otherwise! 

Personally, I wouldn't ask my partner to tongue my butt, but if they wanted to I would absolutely be game. I do it for them sometimes, and they seem to moderately enjoy it. 

It is a reasonable expectation for each person in a relationship to have certain things they just really don't like to do... You're absolutely normal!
