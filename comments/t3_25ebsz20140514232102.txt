I am currently in an MS program and will be completing it this fall. One of the main questions people ask me is "Will you go on to complete your PhD?" My answer is always "It is not the best choice for me." 

There are a couple of reasons for this. In my field, the working degree is a Masters and I do not want to continue in academia. I have always struggled with impostor syndrome as well. 

I think it's important as people have mentioned to consider what your ultimate goal is! Do you enjoy research? Do you see yourself being in acedemia and research in 5-10 years? Can you handle the anxiety that will happen as a grad student and is it worth if for your end dream job?

You will make the best decision for yourself! Take the time to consider if this doubt is just a singular moment or if it's happened multiple times during this first couple years. Good luck with your decision!
