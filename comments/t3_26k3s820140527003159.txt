I do believe social sexism works both ways, and i tend to find a fair share of circle jerk in ANY subreddit (human nature being what it is).

That being said i went over to The Red Pill, Opened one topic which seemed legit "Why are there so many abusive men?" and one i knew to be a facepalm going in named "Hypergamy and pornography driving up beta standards".

I was utterly blown away tbh, the first was basically wondering why men would opt to abuse someone citing:

>There are serious legal consequences. Being known as a woman beater isn't exactly a badge of honor. Its a great way to limit future contact with women. Its frowned upon and extremely taboo. There is no benefit to abusing women, only cost.

All in all a well enough written up argumentation that my mind could not wrap itself around this guy not being able to put together the concept "it's not ok to abuse someone, anyone, for any reason".

Not going to qoute from the beta thread, that was some straight out of highschool reasoning.

I thought i was a lost cause in dealing with women, i did not know any socially growing up, i basically grew up behind my screen finding myself at 30 with alot of growing up to do, but even then i walked away from that subreddit feeling instantly better about myself.

Like i hinted at in the first sentence, i've seen some borderline militant and agenda pushing voices here aswel, but they for the most part seem to be getting addressed or lead to discussion with a generally positive purpouse/outcome.
TRP tho is no longer a circlejerk, that's a circleslinky bouncing down the wrong stairs, guess i found a new hobby.

Oh yeah, and i rant, one issue at a time.
