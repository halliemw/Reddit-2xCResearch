This just reminds me of the Avenger's poster I have, and several other movie posters that have been criticized for it. In the Avengers poster I have, all the male superheroes are in their strong stances while Black Widow is of course, turned to the side to show off her boobs and butt. The Divergent poster, IIRC, recited similar criticism.
