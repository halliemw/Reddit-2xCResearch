I love [my Athleta swimsuit](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mDkelSr1CfTkQ_OGm_3PCBQ.jpg) - took forever to find it and it's not a perfect "bra-like" fit but it does the job, is cute and I can actually swim in it. I just paired it with some athletic boyshorts and it's probably the best swimsuit I've ever had.
