Tracking calories is going to be the key to losing weight. If you have a smartphone, I recommend downloading a calorie-tracker app (I have MyFitnessPal). Make sure you track EVERYTHING... when I'm actively tracking my food intake, it makes me think so much more about what I'm eating. It's easy to look back on my day and think, "Wow I only ate oatmeal and a salad and sushi, go me!" and forget about all the little handfuls of nuts/sweets/etc that I ate without thinking, but when I'm tracking my Cals, I make smarter choices about even "little" snacks.

Take time every Sunday (or whatever day you have a bit of a break) to put together snacks and small meals for the week. That way, when you're rushing out the door each day you'll have ready made lunches that you can eat whenever you're free. I'm a big fan of celery/carrot sticks with hummus, apple slices with cheddar cheese, almonds and raisins, you get the idea... Basically, healthy food that I can munch on at work without leaving my desk so I'm not starving by 5 and end up gorging myself at dinner.
