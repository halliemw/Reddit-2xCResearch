If you feel you need to talk about what happened, then keeping it bottled up will only be worse for you both in the long run. Having said that, if you want to give the relationship the best chance to succeed then opening up old wounds while you're still on shaky ground probably isn't the best idea. Take it slow, feel it out, discuss it when the time comes naturally.
If and when you do decide to bring it up, make sure you talk about it in terms of how you felt, rather than what she did.
