Examples: -a poster states she is raped, you should not ask for details and or suggest that what she went through is â€œnot really rape; probably just a misunderstanding"  

-a poster complains about someone being inappropriate and asking if she's misconstrued the situation.

The main thing will be tone. There's a world of difference between offering alternative interpretations of an event and invalidating a person's interpretation. I would be cautious and refrain from putting in a comment if I thought I was on the line.
