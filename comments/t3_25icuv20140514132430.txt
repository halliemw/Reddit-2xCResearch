I saw a girl right in front of me beg me for help the first time she was molested on a jam packed train.. she couldn't even look at the guy because she was so caught of guard and so very ashamed. I told him to back off, he groped me, and I slapped him.

People have different reactions to these situations.  People who are introverted/non-confrontational are more likely to be at a loss with how to deal with such a shocking and complex situation (because their "natural response" tends to be passive and observational rather than aggressive and interactive)

The girl never told anyone what happened (and I respected that she just wanted everything about the situation to go away)

I flipped my shit, yelled in faces, drank too much that night, and cried it out in the true spirit of being a shit show.

People have different personalities. We can't judge how someone behaves in a situation when they're a victim.... instinctive reactions vary wildly.
