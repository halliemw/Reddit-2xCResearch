The problem with getting help this summer is that I'm only here for another 5 weeks, then I'm with my parents for about 8 weeks, then back here. So there isn't much time.

I think she does do the right kind of counselling - trying to make me think positively. It's just not worked. And has made me feel worse about myself and more anxious about similar things happening to me in the future.
