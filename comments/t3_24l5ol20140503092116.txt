Did you listen to the song?

I know I've lost someone who I considered a friend, and had someone tell me some of the nasty things he said behind my back, because I'd 'friend-zoned' him. It really hurt. I thought we had a real, if platonic, bond, and it hurt to learn it was based on a fiction. And there was a degree of bitterness in learning all the things I done to help him as a friend meant so little to him.

If that's how he truly felt, then yes, I'm happy that he chose to stop faking a connection and move on. But I grieve the genuine friend I thought I had.
