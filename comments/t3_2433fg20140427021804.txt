Which way the gender bias swings depends completely on the context. 

XY SAHD here. When we are out with the baby, it's her people ask about how feeding and napping goes and tell her what I should do at home. When I apply for a kindergarden place, naming her as the second legal guardian, the return letter is adressed to her. 

If it bothers you, I think the best you can do is to point it out when it happens. Ideally, sensitivize your SO, so that he will point out that you are a human being worth of being adressed directly. (Edit: Not because you couldn't, but I think the effect is stronger when a third person points out injustice than when one 'just' complains.)

Come to think of it, a few weeks ago someone on a fair tried to educate us about violence against women (women's issues/feminism in general). *They* again ignored her completely, I got the talk-to and the flyers.
