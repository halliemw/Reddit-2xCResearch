Yes, this is my point when I think critically about the hijab. It's totally their choice, no ones forcing them, but I think it's fundamentally sexist and wrong. It's just as wrong as Christian beliefs and their oppression of women. I don't understand why this is seen as ok to feminists. The whole idea that a woman should have to cover up for "modesty" is just not right. To me, at least, it's just my opinion.
