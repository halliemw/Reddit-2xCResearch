> the general Reddit population is coming in here to downvote all submissions

I'm sorry, but that's a gross overgeneralization of what Reddit is.

Why can't we agree that a portion of Reddit (I don't have statistics on what percentage, but let's presume for the sake of your argument it's big) is against this subreddit, but that's it's not "the general Reddit population"?
