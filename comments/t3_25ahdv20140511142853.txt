I was just going over some bodies resume the other day and was honestly shocked at how awful they made themselves sound! I think it helps to talk it out with someone. Telling them exactly what you did, sometimes they can find a more exciting way to say it. 

I'm no expert but my biggest word of advise is ACTIVE VERBS. You don't have to lie, but find ways to say things like "lead", "created",  "developed". Words that make it sound like you did something not just watching someone do things. 

In a résumé you are selling yourself, you want to highlight the best parts of yourself while making the worst parts sound insignificant. 

Think to yourself, how did I make the company better? Daily, weekly, over the course of my time there? Those are the things you want to say. 

I'm only 20, so I'm still transitioning from retail in to business in my résumé. However when sending out my résumé for office work I try to make my retail work sound relevant. It's about manipulating the experience you have to fit their needs.
