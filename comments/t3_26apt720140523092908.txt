Yep. Or if your sleep cycle has changed, your eating habits, maybe you've cranked up the intensity in your workout, dropped a few pounds and didn't even notice, anything. Missing a period once in a while is nothing to worry about unless you might be pregnant, in which case take a test. It's concerning if it becomes a pattern or if you go more than the length of two regular cycles for you without a period.
