Agreeing with blessyousharkle, I have never been an active participant on many subs, but I love this subreddit and its one of the few that I specifically browse. So I'm giving it the ol' college try and going through the new tab to upvote all the positivity I can find. If you do feel the need to jump ship, the related subs on the side can help, but I recommend giving an attempt to upvote and highlight the positive content of twox, and maybe give it a chance of survival on the defaults.
