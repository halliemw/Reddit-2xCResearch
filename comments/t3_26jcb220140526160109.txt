We would totally support that, [we have this linked in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/related_links_and_discussions#wiki_abortion_support) and would be very open to expanding the list. We've always had to be cautious which sites we put there since many aren't what they appear.
