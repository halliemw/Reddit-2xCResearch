Now I don't want this to sound the wrong way.  These people are being fucking retarded, being attractive is not an invitation to be disrespected.  However, in my experience.  People can sense fear and anxiety.  Extreme anxiety is generally evident.  I'm not sure why the hell they would say Act crazy or dress uglier, that's not something that I've ever known a mental health professional to say.  That's dumb.  That last one sounds like victim blaming which only retards addressing any situation involving verbal/physical/sexual abuse in a constructive way.  

You are hiding and people are trying to route you out is sort of the feeling I'm getting from this though.  There are ways to blend without being so obviously hiding if that is your goal.  You may look different for your area though.  I am reminded of my friend who went to South Korea to teach in a hagwon.  She had red hair and was large in stature so she simply stuck out there.  She would be followed home and one man even flashed her.  She hated that place because of it and I always thought it tragic.  This is why women don't travel alone.  It's hard because until we target the way people perceive single women and how we choose to define them.  In short, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  I'm rambling.  

I am not a mental health professional.  

I like to write letters if you'd like a pen pal.
