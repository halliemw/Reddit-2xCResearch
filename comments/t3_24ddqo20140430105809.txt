I love it... but I do wish that they didn't very deliberately focus on solely female victims. They also didn't say anything that the world doesn't already know. Sexual assault on women is wrong, get consent from her.  Great! 

But I think the 'don't be that guy' campaign is more effective in telling people that you can still rape someone without being the masked figure in the bushes. This ad doesn't bring anything new to the table besides recognizable faces.
