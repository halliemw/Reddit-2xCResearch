If the string would break (which I never heard of tbh) it's no disaster.
What I would suggest (for all women/girls btw): 

Get to know yourself! 

Take a mirror, feel, explore. You will notice your vagina is not that deep and is blocked by your cervix so things don't really get easily lost in there. Also knowing the shape/direction your vagina is in will help a lot with inserting a tampon.
The lube advice is also really good. Remember the best/cheapest lube is your saliva ;)
