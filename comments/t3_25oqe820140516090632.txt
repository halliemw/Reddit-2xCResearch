This is what always gets me about the anecdotal stories so many redditors and MRAs are always sharing about false rape accusations. Well no shit your friend denied raping that girl, fuckin duh?! What do you think the guy who did it to me says? Maybe its not fair, but whenever I hear "My friend was accused and he didnt do it" or "I was accused and I didnt do it" you know what I think? Yeah, you probably did do it.
