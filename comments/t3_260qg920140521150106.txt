As other commenters have noted, it's extremely rare for a woman to expel her IUD and not know it, with the exception of during a bout of very heavy bleeding.  It's not necessary to feel the strings in order for it to work, but it might be necessary for you to feel comfortable using the method.  It's awesome your gynecologist was able to offer you options!  There's probably no right answer, and you should do what you're most comfortable with.
