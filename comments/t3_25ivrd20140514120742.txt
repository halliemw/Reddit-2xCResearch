>Some time after her final email, a date took me to a restaurant in which Emma happened to be waitressing.

>She grimaced when she saw me. Her expression seemed mixed with frustration and anger. She walked by our table about two dozen times without ever making eye contact. For nearly a year, I’d had only a couple of short email sentences saying she wanted no further contact with me. It was quite powerful to see emotion in her. Until that night, I didn’t realize how angry she is at me—but in person, it was obvious.

>When we don’t tell people why we’re angry at them, we’re also robbing them of a chance to apologize and make amends. I would like nothing better than to understand how I’ve hurt or upset Emma and to apologize and make repairs.


This guy is *beyond* delusional.  He not only can't understand why the woman he's been harassing off-and-on for over a year is upset when he "accidentally" shows up at her job, but he pretends to not understand *why* she's upset to see him.  

Oh, this awful maenad, so selfish in her desire to further inflict pain upon his poor tortured soul.  Can't she see that if only she would continue to communicate with him and allow him to simply explain himself, she would realize what a genuine and wonderful man he is and want to be with him forever?

There's currently an Ask Reddit thread on the front page about what red flags a guy gives to show he's crazy.  This guy should be at the top of the page.  He is *literally* the same person as Paul Rudd in the 40-Year-Old Virgin.
