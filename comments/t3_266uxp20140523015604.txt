Thank you for the reply Samipearl19. We are both independently in therapy, but it is a good reminder that there is a reason that couple counseling exists. I posted online to get a starting point because I had no idea where to go from here. I am receiving a lot of good replies and I appreciate everyone who is taking their time to read and respond to my inquiry.
