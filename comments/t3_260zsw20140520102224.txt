Thank you so much for your comments.

>Why is this a dealbreaker when he picks and chooses from his faith? It's tricky to frame that in a non-judgemental way, and without offending his faith, but it needs to be asked. Why is this the thing he cares about when everything else is fine?

These are really good questions that he does struggle to answer. 

I think the Corinthians passage refers to two people who marry as non believers, and then one finds the faith. 

I don't really think he's in any danger of losing his faith, but your words are certainly a valid perspective and I hear them. 

>Again, a religious community might be a good idea for him, since it might be that as a solitary practitioner, he's just missing that sense of having others with shared beliefs.

Good point, I've wondered/thought this too. We're in the middle of A LOT right now obviously but this is something he'd like to find as well.

>But at the end of the day, if he was going to put imaginary beings above his very real girlfriend, there's not a lot you can do there. 

I feel this and it is in line with my beliefs, but God is very much not imaginary to him.
