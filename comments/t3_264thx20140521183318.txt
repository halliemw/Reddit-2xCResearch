I totally get you. I have mixed feelings about this word. Overall, I'm not a huge fan of schmoopy couple talk but to be fair, it's because I'm not in a relationship so I've only been privy to "baby"s and "poohbears" from a third wheel perspective and it's kind of embarrassing.

I think like any word, it depends on the tone and the person who says it. If it's sincere and said with love and fondness, I might like it.
