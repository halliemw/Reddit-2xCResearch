TL;DR

Man believes his religion is more important than his love for you.

If you do not believe, that is your business and you cannot pretend to believe - it would be futile.
If he values his relationship with his God more than he does his relationship with you, then he is *not living in the real world*.

Perhaps if you were aggressive about it, if you insisted he give up his religion or mocked it, he would be behaving reasonably, but he is not.

Interfaith partnerships can work, but only when one person is not trying to proselytise the other. If he cannot respect your own personal beliefs, then he is the worst kind of believer and you are never going to be his priority.

I am really sorry if this seems horrible, and I hope he comes to his senses. But in my opinion, the worst-case scenario would be that you convince yourself you are a Christian through fear of losing him, and end up living a lie whilst he gets to control every last bit of who you are under cover of 'religious conviction'.
