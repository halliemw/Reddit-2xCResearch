Emotional cheating is prolonged contact with someone for emotional support and emotional validation. Literally all we know is that he flirted with a girl he used to cyber with almost 10 years ago and OP is nervous because she has a history of cheaters.

OP has also pointed out that he seems genuinely remorseful over his messages. If you consider what he says to be true then both he and OP are in the wrong for breach of trust.
