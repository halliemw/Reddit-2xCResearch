I actually had this same thing happen to me but I was only about 12 or 13 at the time. My reaction was not nearly as creative as yours. I was so confused and luckily he just drove off. Wtf is wrong with people?!?!

And thank you for sharing. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Your instincts served you well!
