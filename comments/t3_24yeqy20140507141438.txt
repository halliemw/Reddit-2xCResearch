I agree. It's just the issue of convincing well to do white folks that they need to move into an area with a higher rate of crime and a lower overall factor of safety. I know for a fact that I'd be happier living a safer life, it seems an obvious decision to me to make decision based on my safety. I don't walk in the middle of the night through bad neighborhoods for this reason.
