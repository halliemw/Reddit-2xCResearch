"Essentially what I am very poorly trying to say is that all of the complications that can come from a mirena should have been checked for by your doctor."

And they have been. I was not sexually active before I had the Mirena inserted so the chance of STI's was pretty nil, but my previous gyno did check me anyway.

I've had several CT scans and pelvic ultrasounds over the past year (3 month follow up after insertion, follow ups for the ruptured cysts) and every report has stated that the Mirena is perfectly in place. 

In a way, I am hoping my pain has somehow been amped up by stress/depression. I've been achey on and off since I got the Mirena but never to the extent as I have been over the past two months. I've also been (admittedly) inordinately stressed over the past two months as well.

Thyroid bloodwork has been clean for a while (and I get it tested pretty routinely as I have a nodule that's been monitored for the past two years.) As I mentioned, I'm getting bloodwork done for potential arthritis soon...so I'm interested to see if anything shows up with that.
