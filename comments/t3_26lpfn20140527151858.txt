I don't work. I'm a SAHM, so a fair chunk of my time is dedicated to caring for my son, keeping him occupied. He's only 6 months old, but that can be challenging enough at times. :)  
  
Like you, I run errands, do housework and cook. My husband and I agreed a long time ago to do our own laundry, so he looks after his own clothes, and I do mine, our son's and anything else for the house (towels, sheets etc).  
  
Aside from that, I am working on getting fit, and I stay in close touch with family and friends.  
  
For myself, I think that's valuable enough. I don't derive much happiness from working, but this... this makes me feel the happiest I have ever been in my life. And that's the only value that matters: Our own happiness.
