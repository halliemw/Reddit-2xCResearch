Im guilty of doing the same thing! I've wanted a new job for over a year, applied to dream jobs last summer and kinda spiraled into a what am I doing crisis when I landed none of them. 

Now im up for promotion that would quite honestly change my life - I work for an airline and travel four days a week. Its getting to the point where I just physically dont want tp be at work and cant handle it. This promotion would have me home every night working a support role. So I was so psyched up for it I walked into my bosses office shaking and flubbed most of the questions.  It stinks because I know I could rock the job, and everyone keeps telling me how great I would be and I "for sure" got it. But I'm not confident at all. Here's hoping though!
