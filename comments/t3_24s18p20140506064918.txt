It's a **huge** problem if anonymous internet bullying can drive you to self harm. Please talk to someone. I'm saying that as someone who is currently in counseling to deal with her own shitty coping mechanisms and as someone who watched a lot of people go through this when she was your age. It always starts as a one-time thing. Then it can become addictive for some people, while others turn to other terrible or destructive coping mechanisms. You can save yourself years of misery by talking to a trusted adult and getting into some counseling, if only to learn some healthy ways to handle bullying. A mentally healthy person doesn't cut themselves because an anonymous person on the internet was being cruel and bullying them. You need to nip this in the bud and be proactive about it.
