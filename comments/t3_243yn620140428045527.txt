I would be utterly furious if friends of mine tried to shove me into the moshpit with an expensive camera on me.  I don't think you'd be unjustified in mentioning that their behaviour in this instance was less than ideal.

I'd love to join in the moshpits but I'm very short and generally not dressed for it, so I don't often.
