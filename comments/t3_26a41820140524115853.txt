Adoption really isn't the magic cure some people (not RandGoodfellow) make it sound like. It's another type of life-long responsibilty one has to be ready for and able to handle. Much like when you raise the child, you never know how the future will turn out. It's not like the child goes *poof* and everything's back to the way it was before.
