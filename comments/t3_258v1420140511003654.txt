My mother once told me such a story about my dad:  On an early date (a visit to the beach) he asked my mom if women needed to hollow out divots in the sand for their breasts in order to lie on their stomachs.  He obviously hadn't touched many (any?) breasts at that point in his life.

My mom recently had a bilateral mastectomy (hooray, cancer-free) and once she recovered, I reminded her that she could now go lie on the beach without having to hollow out any divots!
