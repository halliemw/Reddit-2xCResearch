You get him to stop by telling him to STOP. Women are very strongly conditioned by society to be non-confrontational, and it drives me up the wall.  Tell this dude, "Your texts make me uncomfortable.  Stop sending them. I do not want you to contact me anymore." and be firm about it.  If it makes him feel bad, so the fuck what? Right now, you are allowing *his* behavior to make *you* uncomfortable.  You should never feel bad about setting boundaries. Ever.
