Well here are the lyrics:

>Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way

>Two drifters, off to see the world, there's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river and me

>Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way

>Two drifters, off to see the world, there's such a lot of world to see
We're after that same rainbow's end, waiting round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river and me

>Moon river, moon river, moon

I'm ignorant, what are language are you writing it in?
