A character that stands up for herself against all the odds and doesn't just do what's expected of her because of her gender. I guess a strong female character is the same as a strong male character in many ways. It's just that strong female characters stand out a whole lot more because generally they are not seen so often. I will also add that a character can be stereotypically feminine and still be strong IMO
