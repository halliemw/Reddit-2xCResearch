My mum is a good mum. Our relationship has gotten better as I've gotten older-moving away for college really helped get past the teenage angst and move us into a relationship of two adults. The one thing I always struggled with was her weird comments about her body and food. As I've gotten older it's been easier for me to realize when her issues (BDD) are informing what's she's saying to me as I try to lose weight and get healthy, so it's easier for me not to be hurt. I know she developed her own issues with food growing up in a shitty household so it's a long held coping mechanism for her. It used to bug me a lot when I was younger when she would say she was fat because if she was fat then what was I? But now I realize it's all about her issues and not about me, and I can deal with that a lot better. Otherwise she's a fantastic mum and we get along really well, and I always look forward to seeing her (and my dad) when I visit home.
