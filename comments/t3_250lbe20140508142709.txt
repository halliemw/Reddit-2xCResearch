Dry shampoo is perfectly fine for thin fine hair, you just have to buy the right kind. The crappy tresseme? Yea, that stuff isn't going to cut it. The only ones I have tried and liked so far are Batiste and Redkens, both are very light and brush out of your hair, tresseme's made my hair feel so thick and lank, it was awful. Redken's is AH-MAZING, but it's expensive. I always try to get cans on sale lol. It is so light and it actually poofs up my roots.
