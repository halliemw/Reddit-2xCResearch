I had a kid in my sex ed class volunteer for the duct tape thing, then when the instructor asked what he thought that meant when it didn't stick to the other girl's duct tape, he gave her a run for her money.  Paraphrasing (because this was 10 years ago):  "My tape doesn't stick to hers because we've both had sex and we both know what we want in a partner, so we're not compatible?"
