+1/-1: 

+1 Standing elevated face in line with screw makes this more dangerous because if a screw does pop and strike near the eye OP may jump back and cause a serious injury to the Brienne who's holding OP up there (or OP). It's an injury that causes a worse injury kinda thing.

-1: Slow drillin' even with a face that close to the work isn't all that likely to cause an explosive ricochet at all. If OP were hammering on the other hand...well yeah.

Verdict: Walk barefoot in the grass. It's o.k..
