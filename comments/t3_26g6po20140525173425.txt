If it was toxic male entitlement, it was a particularly bizarre variation thereof. This is a guy who was incredibly angry about the imagined happy lives of others around him, presumed women hated him to the point of extreme anxiety when opportunity arose to interact with them, and felt like he had nothing of value to offer the world.

Just a bit different from the arrogant "god's gift to women" stereotype.
