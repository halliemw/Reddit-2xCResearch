Yeah, but the point of IFF is that it's the only day of the week that we can post images directly. By moving all the IFF pictures into one thread, they're no longer being posted directly, which defeats the purpose of IFF in the first place. I do see where you're coming from, though, and I do think it would work well for major news stories and such, like your Hillary Clinton example.
