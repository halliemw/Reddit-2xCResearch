This situation would definitely make me feel uncomfortable.

What if you had a male coworker? How would he be treated?


I'm not sure what you do, but if your dept is the one that most commonly interacts face-to-face with new people, they could be trying to emphasize the importance of presentation. It seems that they're not trying to reinforce that you're only as good as your appearance - it's just a small part of all the other training things you have.
