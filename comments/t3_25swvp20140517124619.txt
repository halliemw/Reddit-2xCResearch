You have nothing to be ashamed of, the problem is not you it is the shitty proprietary attitude people have toward you. Don't hide yourself little sister wear those pretty dresses and skirts. Fuck everybody for assuming they think they know who you are. Don't let them do that. You are allowed to be beautiful and to have a beautiful body that belongs to you and you only.

I wish I could say something wise that would be of practical use to you and I am sorry I don't. But don't hide yourself because then you are letting the stupid reactions of others define you. On the other hand this is easy for me to say because I am not you and I am not experiencing what you are experiencing or feeling what you are feeling. But I am sad internet stranger that you hate yourself because of all this. 

It blows, if you are an ugly woman ( and really who gets to define that one ) you learn to hate yourself because you are not up to conventional standards. If you are a woman of color you are judged for not being the white default. If you are an older woman you are no longer considered "useful" as a sexual being. If you are fat or oddly shaped you are similarly shamed for failing to be the norm.

If it was up to me you would allowed to be you and beautiful without reservation.
