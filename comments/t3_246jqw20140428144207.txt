I go between lazy and super active. I used to think I was horrible for my lazy periods, but then I realized that I wasn't giving myself enough credit for the times when I was really active and I wasn't using those times very productively either. I'd spend more time worrying about how lazy I was when I had lots of energy than actually doing stuff. 

After awhile I learned that it's normal for me to go through periods of intense work and focus and follow up with a lull in my activity levels. 

For awhile now I have been managing my active and lazy periods really well, I get a lot accomplished. Though sometimes I think my friends and acquaintances are in wonder that I'm doing so well because they usually only get to see me when I'm being a lazy, indulgent, slacker.
