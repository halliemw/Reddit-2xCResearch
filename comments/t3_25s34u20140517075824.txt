If you can't sublet... There's home systems made for renters & possibly get a dog. I don't have that problem but I do have anxiety and getting a dog (doesn't matter that he's a huge teddy bear wimp) has helped me tremendously. He's a greyhound/lab mix & I taught him to bark and hush on command. It's an intimidating bark for people which keeps them away. 

Good luck!!!
