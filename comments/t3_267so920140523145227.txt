I think it's like 1-2 weeks? Some seem to recommend 4 weeks but that's kind of overkill IMO. But, I'm not a doctor.

The problem is lactose so it's pretty much all dairy. I was consuming at least 8 oz of milk a day, plus other dairy products, so it was doing a number on me! Generally hard cheeses, butter, and even yogurt are easier to handle/have less lactose. But I think initially you want to cut it all out.

There are actual tests for lactose intolerance though, so you can get tested and diagnosed by a doctor if you think you have it. In my case I thought I was having issues with multiple foods including stuff that can't be tested for.
