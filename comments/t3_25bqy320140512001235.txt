I often go for a walk by my house the path is beside a small highway.  EVERYTTIME someone cat calls at me from their car.  EXCEPT for the year and a half time span when I got fat from depression issues, but when I got thin again, the catcalls began again.  I have also had a guy follow me home once and after that, for almost a year, would walk past my house periodically and stop at the foot of my driveway.  I had to keep switching up the time of day that I would go for a walk or run.  


I live in one of the safest neighborhoods in my city :/
