>The letter describes how the parents tried to convince Kelley to change her mind. Their three children were born prematurely, and two of them had to spend months in the hospital and still had medical problems. They wanted something better for this child.

I think this is important to consider for those who thought the parents simply did not want to 'deal with' a special needs child.
