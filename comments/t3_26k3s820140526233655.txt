Thank you for this. Many times during discussion about these topics,  I feel ashamed. Like I did something wrong in that moment.  I'm not sure what I did, and I know the person talking is pissed off, but I didn't so anything. So it's easier to walk away. I want to help, but I hate feeling like the dick between my legs makes women look at me more accusingly.  Which is ironic, because the discussion is about mot doing that to women. So I get frustrated, and determine I'll do what I can personally, but I'll never open my mouth about it for fear of being accused. 

Your post is one of the few where I do not feel like that.
