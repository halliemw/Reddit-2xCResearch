I'd really dislike it as well, but it would also be really odd to hear someone say "good woman" or "good man" or whatever in my area, either.  Is it common where you are?

The only man who ever said "good girl" to me in a work setting also patted me on the head, like I was a dog.  So that was... irksome.
