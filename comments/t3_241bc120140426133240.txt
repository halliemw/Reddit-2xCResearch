> Everyone here is wrong.

Everyone and no one here is wrong because OP has not mentioned where she lives (I am assuming M.A. is for Master of Arts, not Massachussets). It is very possible that those questions are illegal and it is very possible they are legal. Laws vary from country to country and within some countries, from state (or province or land...) to state which is why giving legal advice on this kind of post is completely pointless.

(*) with an exception for people who took the time to specify where their advice apply but ironically, you didn't.
