It's your brand of absolutism that destroys relationships and kills happiness. You stop making decisions about the relationship together, that kills the relationship. I understand that the man's say can't be as large as the woman's (with current technology, presuming the development of artificial wombs in the future), but that doesn't mean he shouldn't get any say.

It's like me telling you that I'm moving to California from New York (where we both live) and that we're going to continue dating each other, long distance. It may be my decision, yes, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get any say in the issue.
