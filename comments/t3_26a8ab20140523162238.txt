Well my personal experience says otherwise. I have been around people I have known that have been blacked out, and I wouldn't have guessed they were blacked out. That's why blacking out causes so many problems. Because a lot of people are still pretty awake and interactive. And entitled? Your wording is constantly putting the blame on the other person. So I go out to a bar. Have some drinks. I meet some guy. He's cute, and he's nice, and he's funny. We get chatting. Have a couple more drinks. I say fuck it and decide to just have some fun tonight. I go back and have sex. Then we go about our lives. So he's the entitled one by being a willing participant? Did I have no hand in creating the situation? How does that make sense?
