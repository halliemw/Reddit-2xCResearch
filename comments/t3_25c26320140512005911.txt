I've cried in front of my (always male) bosses several times during my career.  I agree that it doesn't feel "professional", and as I work in a very male-dominated industry I desperately try not to, but hey - sometimes emotions just get the better of me.  

In my experience most of my bosses have reacted extremely compassionately, and I don't think that my crying has detrimentally affected my reputation/career/etc.  

It's a fine line though, because even though I would never do so, I can see how tears could be exploited to manipulate situations.
