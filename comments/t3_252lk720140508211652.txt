As someone who has some family from Iran and has traveled there before, it's truly a beautiful country with great people. The government's limiting laws are looked down upon by a *lot* of the population. I distinctly remember seeing a sign that said "men only" on an arcade game (the type that simulates roller coasters) but promptly riding it anyways.
