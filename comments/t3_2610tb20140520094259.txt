I get what you are saying, I think. I don't actively pursue long distance relationships. I happened to fall for a guy that was somewhat far. But I don't think our distance is an excuse or even a reason for what he did and said. It made it tougher to see one another which sucked, and yes in the future I'll need to consider that, but I don't know... I don't think it excuses what he did.
