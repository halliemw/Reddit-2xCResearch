I'm reading through everyone's amazing replies right now and yours in particular made me smile and relax immediately, thank you for sharing your experience...I really think my fiance and I will end up having an extremely intimate, low-key event like this and I was just worried it would be less joyous/memorable and your comment just reminded me that it won't make a difference because I'm marrying the love of my life and anything we do will be perfect, we don't need all the frills...anyway, thank you again ^_^ that sounds so sweet and congratulations on the love in your life :)
