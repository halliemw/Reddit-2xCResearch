I briefly considered it, but wasn't sure if it was relevant to our situation, especially considering he never had the intention of cheating, even emotionally. I also don't really feel like this constitutes emotional cheating. However it's definitely infidelity of some sort, especially when it was discussed previously. It's something we agreed on, it wasn't just something assumed. So I wasn't sure, really.
