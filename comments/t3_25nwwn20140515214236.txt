IMO, it's the fact that you aren't always trying to lose weight- or "improve yourself" as other might think you are. I went to university and actually lost a noticeable amount of weight, mainly because I couldn't afford so much shitty foods, and sometimes I simply couldn't afford a healthy amount of food(I was extremely self-reliant, no loans or family support). And when somebody asked me how much weight I lost, followed by a comment about how I looked better, I cringed so hard.

People can look good at any weight. To some it's a bit of a backhanded compliment. But in other situations it can bring you a little motivation to strive for 'better' if it's what you're looking for.
