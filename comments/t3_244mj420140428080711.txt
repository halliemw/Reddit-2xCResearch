Parents are not just those who raised you but those who share a family relation. The child will be deprived of their parents because the people they grow up with do not share a biological relation. It is the intentional creation of orphans. From [Family History](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2088329) by J David Velleman

> When people deny the importance of biological ties, I wonder how they can read world literature with any comprehension. How do they make any sense of Telemachus, who goes in search of a father he cannot remember.  What do they think is the dramatic engine of the Oedipus story? When the adoptive grandson of Pharoah says "I have been a stranger in a strange land," do they take him to be speaking merely as an Egyptian in the land of Midian? How can they even understand the colloquy between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker? Surely the revelation "I am your father" should strike them as a bit of dramatic stupidity-a remark to be answered "So what?"
