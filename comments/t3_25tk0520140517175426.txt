Since you were likely not ovulating and you took Plan B immediately, there's an impossibly small chance of you being pregnant. A potential side effect of Plan B is a delayed period. 

I would agree with the suggestion to test now. Since it would be up to a month after the supposed time of conception, I would expect most tests to be able to pick up on it.
