I'll give an example:

Talking about how mechanics treat us when we're alone compared to how they treat us when we come in with a father/boyfriend/husband someone kept responding to me saying "Well I'm a woman and I've never had that happen. Its all in your head." 2 seconds of looking at their comment history showed they were not even a woman, they were just pretending to be a woman in order to try to tell me my personal experiences werent valid.

Very annoying.
