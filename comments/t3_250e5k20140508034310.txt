Shaving the head, at least in the army, is flat out forbidden for women:

> Likewise, trendy styles that result in shaved portions of the scalp (other than the neckline) or designs cut into the hair are prohibited. *(this is from the section that is specifically about female hair standards)*

The buzzcuts that do leave some hair are not explicitly forbidden, but "extreme, eccentric or trendy haircuts or hairstyles" are, and it is up to the commander to decide whether buzzcuts that leave some hair are included. And quite a bit do.

I am a dude, and not in the armed forces, but worked on a number of bases for a while, and had a couple conversations with enlisted personnel (and NCOs) who explained this to me (I was curious). Then looked it up in the army regs.
