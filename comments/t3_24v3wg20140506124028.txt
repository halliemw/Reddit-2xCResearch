Affectionate shushing I find okay. Sometimes mi novio has to remind me that we aren't alone in the house with a "shhhhh", and I find it ridiculously hot when he puts his hand over my mouth and maintains eye contact sort of grinning, like, "I want to hear you, because I love what's going on right now, and love that I'm doing it to you, but we need to be quieter". Ughhhh. So. Fucking. Hot. Sadly, he won't be home from work for 4 more hours. I need to quit this thread.
