> If this had been someone other than Playboy, I do t think we would have heard about it. 

I think this is really the crux of this story. Context is important in these types of discussions, and I guess that Neko Case feels that Playboy is not in a position to making comment about what women should or shouldn't be 'in music' (though admittedly she didn't really express that very well). I don't have a problem with Playboy for what it is, but I'm inclined to agree.
