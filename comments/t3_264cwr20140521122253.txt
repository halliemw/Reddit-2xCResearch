Do you remember in school, if someone was being bullied and the teachers confronted the bully, the bully would use the defence of "I was just joking!"? But it never was a real excuse? And they never were "just joking"? It doesn't really matter if they meant to joke or not. What matters is how it makes you feel. And from the sounds of it, it makes you feel really hurt, and rightfully so. And the thing with women? That's not okay at all. Like, I'm pretty sure most men have those fantasies, but thats what they are - fantasies. Its one thing for a guy to see a hot girl and think to himself, man I'd tap that, but it's completely not okay for him to tell you that. Especially when its about people you know. None of what he's doing is okay and thats not how relationships work.
