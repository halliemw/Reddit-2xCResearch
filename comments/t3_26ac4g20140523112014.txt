Women are more likely to take time off or work part time in their careers. As such, the ones that do this are less likely to get promotions or raises. For the pay to be truly equal, you would be paying your average women the same as the average man, even though she does less work. True pay equality can only really be achieved through jobs that are paid hourly.
