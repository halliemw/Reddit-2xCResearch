You can do whatever you want :) The rings don't have to match. You can buy a dress that's been previously owned for far less than a brand new one. Alternatively - if you wear a nontraditional dress, you can spend whatever you want. There are really no rules, you can spend as much or as little as you want. If you get married with a justice of the peace, you can worry less about spending money on a venue, and maybe just have a party with your family. You say you don't know what else to account for - flowers, venue, food and music are main points people spend money on for weddings as well. Have you been to any weddings that you liked?
