I submit to Jesus because through him I've been forgiven, made new, and sent. Through the Holy Spirit I am able to love the unlovable, forgive the unforgivable, and sacrifice in the name of love... All things that he first did for me.

I find it ironic that you want me to submit to you by not submitting to the God who loves me and healed me. Don't worry, internet stranger. I am in very good hands-- the hands of the Great I Am who spoke the universe into being. I'll be just fine.
