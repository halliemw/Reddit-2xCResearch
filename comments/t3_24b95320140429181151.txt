I am pregnant too and feel many of the same feelings you're stating when I read the article.  I posted it here to start a conversation and to see what  other likeminded women thought of it.  I completely resent the lazy part too...I am kicking ass at a really intense job every day and I still go home and make sure my home is clean and things are in order...I feel like the furthest thing from lazy.  Anyway, just wanted to let you know I agree with you and hope you don't think that I agree with the article because I posted it here.
