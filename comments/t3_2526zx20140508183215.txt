I know, I'm really trying not to delete the main post because even if I am patently awful at describing what I mean, or whatever, this discussion needs to be had for 2XC's sake. But at the same time, I've had 3 death threats over PM already. I've turned off notifications, at least. Urgh. I feel so naive for thinking that we could have this conversation here, particularly now that it is already a default. I definitely regret making the post as a spur of the moment thing, wish I had rephrased, or just wish I hadn't bothered, but it's done, what's said is said and I really want to stick to my guns so people talk and have discourse.
