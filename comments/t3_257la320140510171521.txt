> Semi/demi permanent dyes in funky colors can last much longer than you thought they would and hang on in the most unwanted ways

As a long-time user of unnatural colored dyes, this is so very true.  I've pretty much given up trying to bleach out the colors after 15 years of doing it.  Instead, I rotate between bright red and dark blues and purples.  Once the reds fade out a bit to a pinkish shade, I put a blue or purple over it.  After a month or so the blue/purple has faded a bit, and at that point my roots need to be done anyway, so I bleach it all and do it red again.

I have a regular patient at my work who used a beautiful pink dye *4 years ago* and it's still very noticeable in parts of her blonde hair.
