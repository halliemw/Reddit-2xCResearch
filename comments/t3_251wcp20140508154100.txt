I took a look at redpill, seems pretty emotionally damaged and stupid to me.  

  
What's so bad about gonewild? The women know they will get stuff, be desired, its exciting for them. It think gonewild is mostly full of lonely men.    
  
  
I think a lot of reddits user dislike the word feminism because the very extreme feminst groups that have ruined the name feminism in the past and present. Some groups have made it more about more rights for women, rather than equality. Which damaged the movements reputation very badly. 
  
  
At this point, at least in my country (i know its very bad in less civilized/poorer countries, especially India seems bad) it would be more fitting to have a gender equality movement instead of a womens equality movement. The word itself implies it's fighting for women, not equality.   
  
Edit: your points are of course valid, i am just trying to give more sides to it. I get that this sub is afraid of an influx of men that doesn't understand, and i am sorry if i added to that fear with this.  
  
But still, it doesnt sit right with me that you say things like; most of reddit will blame the victim for rape?    
  
  
Just no. There is a lot of proof that the reddit userbase is fairly emotionally understanding and supportive. After all, we are a crosssection of the worlds population. "95%" of the people here are "normal" people you see in the street.
