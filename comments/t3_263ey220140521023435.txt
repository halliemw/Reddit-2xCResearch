I'm really happy for you. You've not held the grudge and instead have made an effort to be a good friend again (even though there is no obligation for you too). I can only imagine your friendship will grow from this, slowly but surly. If there is a next time you'll have some experience with dealing with it as well. 

I had a similar experience with my friend except I was the one to break it off (kinda, a bit more mutual but ultimately my choice). I wish I could just email her but I feel guilty, embarrassed, hurt and I'm convinced she probably has no interest in me now. It still effects how I perceive friendships I have now a couple years later. 

I guess the wisdom you could gleam from my immaturity and weakness is: 
1. That you should be proud of yourself for being forgiving and a good friend. 
2. She's probably (defiantly) more anxious then you are.
