Have you tried telling your parents how their reactions and blame make you feel?  Remember that they are products of their generation, and unfortunately victim-blaming in cases of sexual harassment has likely always been the norm for them.  If you were able to make them see that they are wrong and need to do more to protect and support you then maybe you would feel safer and more at ease wearing whatever it is you want to wear.  You shouldn't have to change how you dress in order to compensate for the flaws of others, and you definitely shouldn't feel ashamed.  You sound beautiful and from your words, it's obvious you have a good heart.  You aren't the one who needs to change.
