XY here - I would say that fits the legal and moral definition of rape - you had (on numerous occasions) made your intentions clear, even with a rider "Never ask me to have sex if I've been drinking. I might say 'yes' but my real answer will always be 'no'" - which pretty clearly covers the scenario here.

Probably too late for legal action, but that guy's ass should be in prison - there is NO excuse EVER for rape.

As for the future - it is your body, your choice. Do what feels right for you and in choosing any future partner look for one who will respect you and your beliefs.
