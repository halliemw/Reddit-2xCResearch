I lost my mum when I was 29. She had cancer and I was a nurse and the only one of my sibs who could take time off work to care for her. I moved back home, halfway across the country, and could be with her those last few months. When she realized the year before that she was dying she sent a large manila envelope to each of her kids-there were 9 of us. She had managed to save cards we had sent her, our hospital ID bracelets from birth, report cards. I still get that packet out and look at it to remember what a loving mother she was. I am so happy that you found that baby book. You had a wonderful Mum and she is always with you .
