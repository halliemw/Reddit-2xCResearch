I'm going into my senior year so hopefully I can help a girl out haha

If you want to make friends, you should join a sport or a club. I'd suggest track cos you don't have to try out and it's a great way to get and stay in shape... Don't be discouraged if you're not good at sports, cos the very first day of track I was THE slowest one, but I improved! And made some great friends. 

Don't try so hard... That doesn't mean don't dress nice and don't do your makeup... Do those things if you like to, but don't do things because you tryna impress people or get attention - you'll just look back with embarrassment (from my experiences).

YES, do your homework and classwork, BUT it's not that hard to bullshit stuff and still get the grade... don't stress about the workload. There have been times where I've had to pull all nighters, but that's cos I have bad time management. So just make sure you manage your time well or be prepared to stay up all night (I've don't some of my best work when I did it all in one night haha). So I'm not suggesting don't do your work, but I'm just saying somethings don't need your 100% effort.

Don't be afraid to talk to someone just cos you think they're too popular or something for you cos I've thought that a couple times but those people actually ended up being good friends. 


It's ok if you don't know what you want to do in life yet. 

Try to have fun!
