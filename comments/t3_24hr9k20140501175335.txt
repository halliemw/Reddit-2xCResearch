Internet penpals can be hard to maintain, but sometimes you just get lucky.  It's worth it to keep reaching out in hopes of finding that one person that just clicks.  Maybe you share common interests, or maybe they just occasionally need a sounding board, maybe they'll entertain your struggles and late night rants.  It's usually best (for me anyway) if you can find someone who doesn't expect or want constant attention but can go for a while without contact.

I've exchanged quite a few PM's with people I've found around Reddit and one guy has really stuck around.  I hear from him maybe once a month or so.  We're almost complete opposites in every single way and met under the most unlikely of circumstances (here on 2X, actually) but it seems to work.  The biggest thing that keeps it going is there no expectation of consistent communication.  It happens whenever one of us has something to say or wants to respond.
