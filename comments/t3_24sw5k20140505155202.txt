Going out on a limb here but this sounds like a very common situation of different values. You valued the relationship, he valued what he got from the relationship, which means he can get that outside of your relationship.

He probably wouldn't consciously think this, but I see it happen so often. Doesn't mean he wasn't a good partner for the majority of it or that you misjudged him as a person, just that some people walk into a relationship looking for what they can get out another person because they think that's what relationships are for, without understanding how little respect that shows their partner.
