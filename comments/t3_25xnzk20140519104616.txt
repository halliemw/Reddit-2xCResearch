It's very challenging to be a woman (and to raise a little girl) when essentially the only media images of women are hyper-sexualized. You would think I could raise my daughter with cool things like comic books and super heroes, but, in reality, that still just teaches her that women are sexual objects and need to have a sexual purpose at all times. There are very physically ordinary men in comics. Many put their smarts to good use and build elaborate robots and armor. For the women, what tends to matter is that they wear skintight suits and have huge boobs. I think women are tired of *always* having to be portrayed as sexually appealing to men. We are more than that. I want my daughter to know she's more than that.
