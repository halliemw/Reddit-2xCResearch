I've never understood why anyone thinks that what someone else does with their body hair is up to public comment.  Just as women with piercings and ink used to be subjected to derision but are now pretty well accepted, if more women supported each other's choices perhaps we'd see more variety in how women treated their body hair.  My friends daughter recently spent a large chunk of her savings on a Brazilian because the other girls in her gym class teased her mercilessly about having pubic hair.  It's sad.  Whatever choice you make, it should be your own.
