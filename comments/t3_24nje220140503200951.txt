Well, that's all pretty normal these days. My youngest sis - who is 12 now -got her period 2 years ago. So she started the puberty process at around 8-9, which means your sis appears to be pretty much on-track with her peer group!

As scary as it may seem when our baby sisters (I'm 20 years older than my  youngest sis, so it's like she was MY baby in a lot of ways) start this process, there's no sense in panicking. It's gonna happen, and all you can do is be supportive of her self-esteem and guide her through the rocky process of becoming a grown person instead of a "kid" between the ages of 8-9 and 17-18. 

Remember that the ego of a pubescent girl is a wildly fluctuating monster, of almost bi-polar proportions: she's on top of the world one minute, and practically suicidal the next. Help your sis learn to take care of her body (washing face and hair, managing odors, regular exercise in some fun way.) Club sports can be a great way to combo working out with making new friends outside of school. Doing things with your sis, like getting makeovers and going hiking, lets her know that you're in the trenches with her and builds rapport. Keeping the lines of communication open is the key to making sure that she learns about healthy relationships. 

Just love her, you're gonna do great and you'll both live through these trying years =)
