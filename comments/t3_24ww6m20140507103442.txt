Interesting I'd much rather be in a car than just standing, with a closed car someone would really have to work to touch me in any way. 

I think if you're of the mind to have a rational thought out response, it should be a calm "no" or "no sorry." But it sounds like you were really rattled and startled so I don't blame you at all for yelling.
