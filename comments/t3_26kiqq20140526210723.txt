A few tips off the top of my head 

1)Take a look around your vagina with a hand mirror. It's possible (though unlikely) that your hymen is getting in the way

2) Use a plastic applicator like tampax pearl or U by Kotex in the "slim" or "sleek" size. Plastic applicators are just easier and the slim size is designed for younger ladies who haven't lost their virginity or just have small openings. 

3) Try propping one leg up on the toilet when you're inserting the tampon. I had my first successful insertion in this position. 

4) Read the instruction in the box, they really helped me a lot. 

5) Put some lube on the tip of the applicator- it will go in easier. 

Edit: Vaseline is not vagina friendly, apparently
