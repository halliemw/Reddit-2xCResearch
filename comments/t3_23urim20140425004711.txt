>Is it a thread from a woman who has already made the decision to have an abortion and would like to know what to expect? For your own well being as well as that of others, it may be best for you to stay away from that thread. It will not be welcome for you to tell her she's made a bad or wrong decision, it will also not be welcome for you to shame her in any way.
