I had the mirena IUD inserted when I was 19 and had it in for the full five years with no major issue. I've also had the paraguard IUD in for almost five months so far. IUDs dont really dislodge from strenuous activity. they're inside your uterus, not just sitting inside your vaginal canal like a tampon so squat and deadlift away!

The insertion process for both IUDs were uncomfortable and a bit painful but of course both times I didn't take as much ibuprofen beforehand as I was supposed to. It helps to learn some muscle relaxing and breathing techniques beforehand. if you can relax your PC muscles while they're doing the insertion, you wont cramp as much. Do take solace in the fact that you only have to deal with the insertion once and then you never have to deal with it again for three, five or even ten years depending on which one you go for.
