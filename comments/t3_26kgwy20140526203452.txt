He is proud of the fact that he is a sociopath, even refers to himself as a psychopath. I was VERY sheltered growing up, had no real world or relationship experience when I met him, and he was also my first. I left my parents house because of how controlling they are, and feel like I have no where to go. You're right, I need to leave. For awhile I told myself it was just the addiction making him this way, but I can see now even with that issue aside, it's too much for me to handle.
