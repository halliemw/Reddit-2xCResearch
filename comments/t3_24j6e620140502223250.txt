Congratulations! Long distance relationships can be very rewarding. I've been living with my SO for the last two months and it's been an amazing experience. Will you be closing the distance permanently or only while you're studying over there? Either way I wish you and your SO the best. I know the days/weeks following a visit are very hard, so I hope you feel better. You don't have much longer at all. :)
