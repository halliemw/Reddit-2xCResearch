The tweets in the article seemed to dislike the dress pattern and style.  I didn't really see anything that was critical of her weight.  

Those kinds of comments are pretty normal for awards shows.  Even for women who are a size 2.  Joan Rivers criticizes everyone on her show. 

I liked the dress.  It didn't blow me away, but it wasn't a fashion travesty.  

Probably would have been better to ignore the few people who had negative comments.
