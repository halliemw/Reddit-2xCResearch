I stopped wearing my ring regularly when I started working a job where I put on/took off latex gloves all the time and it became a pain in the ass.

I don't wear it currently because I gained some weight and it's uncomfortable at the moment. 

I think it bums out my husband's family, but what are you going to do? They're the people who keep too much pizza and desserts, so when I move out of their place and switch back to all chicken'n'veggies, all the time, they'll see the ring return. 

Also I'm not sure, but I don't know if it's necessary to specifically include transladies. It's nice to point out that they're included, but they're women, why wouldn't they be, you know? Anyone who knows more about this kind of thing might want to weigh in.
