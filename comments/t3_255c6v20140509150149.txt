A good hypothetical example of asking someone to defend their own experience would be like... Okay, a woman wants to share an experience with sexism during her day. Someone at work said something that made her feel belittled in her work group because of her gender. So she comes to 2X to discuss it. Asking her to defend that experience could be challenging questions like "Are you sure he really meant it that way?" It honestly doesn't matter if he did, because she's discussing how it made her *feel* discriminated against. Questions like "Are you sure you're not overreacting?" "How can you be sure he meant to offend you?" "How can you be sure he said that just because you're a woman?" Those are questions which force the poster (who is already stressed out and upset presumably) to go on the defensive and justify her own emotional reaction. 

I think good advice is to either believe the OP when they lay out the situation they are in, or just don't comment at all. I don't feel like productive conversations ever stem out of comments with the subtext of "prove you aren't lying for attention."  It's hard to gauge tone on the internet, too. Sometimes questions which are meant to clarify can be interpreted as challenges. It helps to give people the benefit of the doubt about the facts of their situation because they were there and you weren't, to never assume you know someone else's emotions better than they do (especially if they are a stranger on the internet), and to believe someone's expertise in spotting sexism when they feel they have been on the receiving end of it. 

I'm not much of a poster (I'm shy) but I do read and lurk a lot here, and this is usually how I see fights break out. In regards to your original question, it's probably best if you just report troll posts as soon as you see them, rather than trying to engage in commenting. Be a supportive listener, and throw out upvotes liberally :) that's the best way to combat the downvote brigading.
