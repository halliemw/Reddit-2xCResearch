Kindly don't imply I'm sexist for disliking this kind of memoir. 

If you want to expand on why you think it's valuable go ahead. But it's being billed as very public form of catharsis for Lewinsky, and I don't find that culturally valuable.

Also based on the quotes in the original article, I am less than impressed by the writing and some of the assumptions made.
