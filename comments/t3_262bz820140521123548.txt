The sad thing is, they could have easily turned that very stereotype (and common scenario for a lot of women in tech; I've had similar things happen too) into an interesting plot point in so many ways. They could have had the woman get mistaken for a PM/intern/booth babe/assistant/whatever and play along, and then show up the mistaken person in some kind of entertaining way.
