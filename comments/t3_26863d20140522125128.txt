Is it anything specific going on that's causing these feelings? Or just a general feeling or 'vibe' you get from them? 

I had an ex whose family was the dysfunctional group of people I'd ever had the displeasure of meeting. I should preface by saying my ex was a man child who literally stomped his feet and the words 'because I don't want to' came out of his mouth. His mother encouraged his behavior  and when I realized it was only getting worse, I was the bad for person for breaking up with him while his mother encouraged him to do not only mean and spiteful things, but also illegal things.
