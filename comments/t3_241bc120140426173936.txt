I expected that much, unfortunately. It's still good to hear how to deal with it. I hope it eventually changes, especially as engineering gains more traction with young girls. At least in my class the guys are really respectful of us girls which makes me really happy. I don't know what it's like at other schools, but I hope that the level of respect I've gotten from my fellow classmates is the case elsewhere and slowly the trend can shift towards equal treatment among all engineers. Thanks for your response! What did you major in and what field are you working in now? (Sorry for all the questions!)
