>yet you keep bringing it up

You say that like I've done it on multiple occasions, which I haven't. I've talked to her about it once.

>It can hurt your relationship if she has already thought this through and came to the conclusion to continue this relationship

The thing is, nobody thinks that she did, which is why we were worried. I mentioned this in my post, she's been in some pretty bad relationships- Some even abusive, and tends to not see the bad in anybody that shows her affection and just gets attached to them. I don't really know how to explain it. 

>implying that you believe her decision was wrong

What's wrong with that? If I'm worried about one of her decisions, I'm going to talk to her about it, especially if it involves her possibly getting hurt if I don't. My friends would do the same, and she would do the same for me.

I won't "give her credit", or the benefit of the doubt, or any of that, when she's chosen to stay in abusive relationships before.
