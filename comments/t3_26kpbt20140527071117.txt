Things you can try:

a swabbing of the infected area with hydrogen peroxide

People give me the look of disapproval for this, but I got rid of my yeast infection faster with this since a woman's good vaginal flora produces it anyway.

vinegar in your bath water

pro-probiotics such as acidophilus

coconut oil
