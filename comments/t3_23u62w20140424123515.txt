First of all, breast cancer is only one of many many illnesses in the world. "Over treatment" is ridiculous sounding because no doctor would prescribe chemo and/or radiation without a positive biopsy. Why is "over screening" a huge problem? It's free and there are no risks in going to your doctor every couple of years to get thinks checked out. By the time most people notice anything is wrong it's usually much later than it could have been had they gone to their doctor.
