I ran into that book by accident at the bookstore when I was a kid. I read it a short while later, and immediately insisted on going back to the store for the rest of the series. It took me a few more years to realize _why_ I liked the series so much. Then I forgot about it and took several more years to go "what's that book with the girl and the frying pan..." in a conversation with my husband about fantasy worth reading, and he was all "Dealing With Dragons....?" and I freaked out because he turned out to be the second person ever that I knew read those books.

I reread the series and the short stories the other month and I'm glad to say it still holds up really well to being reread as an adult. Now I'm just really sad that it's so hard to find good scifi/fantasy with such a strong character. I have Patricia Wrede's other books on my to-read, I wonder if they'll be anywhere near as good.
