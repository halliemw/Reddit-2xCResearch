I received a lot of catcalls when I was living in Manitoba.  I also had men come up to me to and aggressively hit on me.  This started when I was 15 and it was a daily occurrence.  I hated it.

Since I started living in BC (Vancouver Island, specifically), I've probably received two catcalls in the nine months I've been living here.

My current city has a smaller, older, and wealthier population than my old one.  That might have something to do with it.  I'm sure if I moved to Vancouver, I'd start receiving catcalls again.
