You're missing the point, it was a joke that commits the exact same fallacy as sexism, over-generalization. "Study finds men aren't run by their sex drives, women everywhere confused." "Relax ladies, you can't get upset because it was just a joke!"

There are plenty of men out there who are well aware that periods do not nullify your brain. Only sexist men say that crap, so if you know any, ditch them if you can.
