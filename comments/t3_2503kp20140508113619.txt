Dang, that's a toughie. I can tell you right now that his feelings about this are horribly conflicted, on the one hand, he feels his loyalty and love for you, on the other, this moral dilemma is shaking him to his core. As you've involved him in making the decision and actually talked with him about it at length, he will probably come around to accept it in time. He won't like it, but he'll accept it and respect your choice. 

Whether he is willing to go with you to the clinic is very much a symptom of this acceptance. If he has fully come around to it, he'll probably come, both as proof to himself that he has and to support you. If he hasn't, then he may not or he might force himself to in support for you. And if he doesn't come, then that means he's probably just too conflicted to really make a decision right now. But I imagine he'll probably come around.

As for asking him to go with you, I suppose if I were really mad I could perceive that as cruel, but after a while I think I'd realize that you're just scared about this and need someone you trust to be there with you. So no, it's not cruel, on the contrary, it shows a great deal of trust in his good nature. The fact that he said he'd think about it (and didn't just blow up in anger) shows that he realizes where you're coming from, which is a very good thing.

Hope this all turns out alright for you.
