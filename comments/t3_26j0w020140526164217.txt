I don't feel this guy should be used as an example of why pickup is bad for men. Just like religion you can use those ideas to justify bad things.

Pickup is full of a lot of bad advice and some good advice. There really isn't much out there for socially inept men to understand the process of what it takes to find a partner. Talking with a lot of guy friends it amazes me at the things men can miss or misinterpret. I don't see much of the pickup community as strictly bad except the red pill. That sub is basically women are attracted to confident men. Assholes are confident so be an asshole.

Pickup can be good for women as well. Less socially awkard/inept guys coming off as creepy would be good for the world. It's just there's so much bad advice mixed in that it can leave men worse off. Some of it though is great advice that all men should know and that just gets mixed in with bad advice.
