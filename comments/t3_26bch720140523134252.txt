1. You went on some legal babble-fest about it, but the legalities aren't the issue here. She was right to feel the way she did, and her boyfriend dismissed it like the jerk he seems to be. He was wrong in doing so.

2. Are you arguing as if I condone the violence? Really?

3. "*Her bf indicates that her description of the ex and his behaviour are identical" Yes, and that's the problem. Repeated violations are not the same as welcome behaviour. "*she has some hate on for the ex'" Yes, because he ignored her limits and sexually abused her.

What exactly am I making up?
