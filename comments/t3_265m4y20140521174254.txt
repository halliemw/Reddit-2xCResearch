Line cook for five years here. I really feel you on the wimpy boss issue... Sadly, a boss who can't discipline his employees is hardly a boss at all. Ask him if you can confront those coworkers in his place, with the authority to fire them if it winds up being necessary. If you're that important to the restaurant, ask if you can have the title of sous chef, at the same pay if necessary, just so there's someone around willing to manage the staff. Your kitchen is always going to have lazy, rude or toxic employees, and it's just not going to function if your boss is the only one who can do anything about them.
