>People are kidding themselves if they think all fat people get fat by eating cake all the time and once they stop eating too much they'll just magically get slimmer.

Wait, I'm not trying to be argumentative, but if fat people aren't eating too much (barring the people with medical issues) without burning enough calories, then how *are* they getting fat?

I personally (a normal sized, all around healthy person) lost 40lbs in about 5 months by eating less large meals.  No working out.  I know many people who lose weight this way.  Eating more than your body needs or can burn will cause it to hold on to the weight in most circumstances.  I don't think anyone believes that if a fat person stops eating too much the weight will magically (quickly) fall off, but there will be a difference in time(again, barring any other medical conditions).
