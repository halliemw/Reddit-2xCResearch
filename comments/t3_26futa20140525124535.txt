While I agree that he found a warped ideology online that allowed him to pass blame for the frustration he felt to others instead of himself, I don't think that ultimately lead to his behaviour. If you read his manifesto it seems eerily similar to manifestos like the Unabomber or Anders Breivik (the norwegian extreme right gunman).

I think he was simply a highly disturbed individual who clearly had trouble dealing with frustration in a normal way. If it hadn't been women for denying him sex it would've been immigrants for taking his jobs, or jews for not giving him a bank loan or black people for god knows what. So I think even if he'd never in his life had read any MRA related material, he'd still ended up a lunatic. It just so happened that the MRA stuff matched his feelings of frustration.
