>the tobacco industry has to be the most evil industry ever

Wait till you read about the lead industry. A scientist travelled the rough seas, went to the polar regions and all around the world measuring variations in lead concentrations with depth. He concluded that adding lead to gasoline is the main reason for the massive lead poisoning. He published his research in nature.

All his funding was removed overnight. Inspite of his efforts to warn the world of lead poisoning, he was labelled a crank and crackpot. The purposeful lead poisoning of billions of people went on for years, until its effects were too hard to ignore.
