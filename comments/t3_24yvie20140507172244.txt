Unless he's a student at your school, the campus PD wont even have jurisdiction.  It's probably just some idiot trolling you.  Delete his comments, block his accounts, and he'll very likely piss off before too long.

The police are unlikely to do much about this sort of thing unless he starts threatening you or it escalates in some other way.
