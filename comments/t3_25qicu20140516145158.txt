Thank you for the well thought out response! This is exactly the sort of thing I'd hoped for. I doubt you'll be able to stop some men from coning to fight the trolls, but I like your assessment of it. Interacting with the trolls doesn't help, but sometimes one guy telling another he's acting like a little boy will make them stop. but probably not. From a guy's perspective, hearing about the trolls coming here makes me want to fight them. My first reaction was to find them and beat them at their own game. But my goal was not the mental masturbation fighting bad guys represents, but helping the situation.  So i chose to start this discussion and see what happens. thank you for taking the time to help!
