Thank you. I know full well that could be what's happening. Or maybe I'm *always* a little bit emotional, but now I see it as something it's not. Maybe I *normally* get random cramps, but now I'm noticing it. You guys are helping to remind me that staying calm and keeping my mind off of it is the best option, so thank you. Hopefully I'll be updating in a couple of weeks that it was all in my head!
