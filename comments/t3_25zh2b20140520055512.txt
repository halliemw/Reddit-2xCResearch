If something did happen between them, I really don't feel comfortable being around the dad ever again, but that's up to my boyfriend. We've already decided for other reasons that any kids we have wont be spending time with his parents alone.. mainly because his mom has some serious mental problems and has landed herself in jail quite a few times. And our kids wont be going over to there house really at all when they're younger because it's really gross in there.. they smoke in the house and have five dogs that shed everywhere.
