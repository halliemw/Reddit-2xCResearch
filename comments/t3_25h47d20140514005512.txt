You're saying that you know what the men OP is approached by is saying to her when they approach her.  That they politely introduce themselves and ask her how her day was.  But it could be something like "Hey, can I buy you a drink?"  Or "AY GURL WAN SUM FUK?"  Both of which can be responded to politely by saying "No thanks, Sorry."  Or even "I'm not interested."  

The fact of the matter is, you were really presumptuous against the OP from the start by assuming what kind of man she was approached by and what they were saying to her.  You didn't even *ask* for clarification before saying that.

And even then, why is it okay for them to use gendered slurs in response?  It seems a little off balance.  If I called you a prick just for not being attracted to me and letting me know, wouldn't that be not okay?
