I disagree with your opinion.  As women get a choice I believe men should also have one, especially if they would financially support the abortion.

Let me put it this way: your mindset is the same one used by anti-abortion groups.  If a woman chose to have sex, she's choosing to have a baby.  I don't believe this is the case, choosing to have sex has nothing to do with child rearing.

Also, you shouldn't tell people to "Shut the fuck up" if you would like to actually have a dialogue about your beliefs.
