Routines may be your best bet. When I wanted to know if my terminally ill friend was having an okay day or a bad day -- without being a pest -- I started playing casual games like Words With Friends or Draw Something with him. Every morning I would play a turn and he would usually play his turn within an hour or so. If he didn't play his turn promptly I would call and check in. We never really worked it out as a planned signalling system, but after a couple of weeks it was a very important part of our daily routine. We were consistent enough that he knew I would call whenever I noticed he wasn't feeling well enough to play his turn promptly.
