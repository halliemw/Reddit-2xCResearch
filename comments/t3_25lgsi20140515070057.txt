Congrats! My boyfriend and I started out as an LDR, meeting over the internet. It had its ups and downs, and one day when I was going through the ever-painful "goodbye" at the airport, we decided that was going to be our last one. After 1.5 yrs, I made the move to another country to be with him, and we're been living together for another 1.5!
