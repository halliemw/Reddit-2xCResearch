The more I think about it, the statement of "they were asking for it" is just a way to shift the burden of responsibility via a lesson. 

Punched a customer in the face? Well, they were asking for it being rude to you. Stole valuables while visiting a friends house? They were asking for it not locking them away. Cheated on your SO? Well they were asking for it when they got complacent.

If I were OP, I'd worry about leaving any young children around "friends" who would resort to this reasoning.
