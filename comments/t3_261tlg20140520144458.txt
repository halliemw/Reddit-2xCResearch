I truly doubt anyone has said anything like what you have quoted.  I think it is more an issue where you have trouble recognizing what is appropriate and what isn't in certain social situations.  And all these people talking about how you should be proud of your body and they are body shaming you....let some well-hung guy show up in a tiny little speedo and watch how fast they change their tune.  It's a kids birthday party at a pool.  Dress appropriately or don't go.
