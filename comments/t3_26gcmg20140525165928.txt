As an Australian, I have to wonder how much this would drop if you guys had Universal healthcare and something like our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, where (as simply as I can frame it) the government negotiates with the pharma companies to get drugs at a discount (bulk, after all), and subsidises the cost as well. My Levlen ED (pill) cost me $20.85 for 4 months' worth, or about $5/month. I don't have any health insurance.
