Hi, I'm a lawyer in the UK and in terms of English law there would be no basis at all for your claim to succeed. Obviously things are different in America but I would be amazed if a court found your boyfriend could be held liable. Moreover, your lack of health insurance (even taking into account that you had a policy that was about to begin) would definitely be considered as your fault - it would be clear cut I'm afraid.
