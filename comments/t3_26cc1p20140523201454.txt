True enough, I'm glad you (and many other women) have found this sub. I used to be virulently against this becoming a default. Now I'm accepting, if still really disappointed.

I don't like having to explain basic stuff over and over again to people who really don't seem interested in understanding women's perspectives, despite that being the focus of the sub. I don't like that every new thread I enter with more than 5 posts, I scroll to the bottom to see what I should report, if anything. I never used to do that. I don't like how so many are opposed to the idea that some threads here should be free of criticism/antagonism/debate. They call it an echo chamber to want helpful, supportive comments. All across reddit, male-offered hyperbole is understood for what it is, but women use the tiniest bit of hyperbole and the "Not ALL men" chorus hits at deafening levels. There are so many new people here who I suspect have no ability to empathize, and that's terribly frustrating.

I'm not about to just give up on twox. I just have a feeling that, much like my role on many other subs I frequent, I'll have to take on the role of an educator here too instead of just having a place to relax and shoot the shit. And that's disappointing, because while this place was never a "safe space", it was never so hostile. I get enough of that in my daily life, and it's made visiting this subreddit exhausting at times. 

I'll second /u/kallisti_gold/ here and plug TrollX, it's a pretty fun place. :)
