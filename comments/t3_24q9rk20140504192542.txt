I wouldn't tell someone I have a boyfriend if I don't, but I don't see a problem with saying it if it's true. If a creep chooses to interpret that as "someone else already owns me", that means something is wrong with him, not me. A man might also refuse a woman by saying he already has a girlfriend. That doesn't mean she owns him.
