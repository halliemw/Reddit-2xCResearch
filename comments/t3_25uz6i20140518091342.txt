I had this whole thing written up about condoms... but then re-read your post and it sounds like you're not using condoms at all haha!

There's almost always a benefit to having lube nearby. For me personally, how much lubrication I have is entirely dependent on my emotional state. So if I get distracted or nervous? I dry up. If I dry up during sex, the friction has a tendency to give me microtears on the inside lining. 

This is less an issue if you're not using condoms, since he's providing a little bit of lubrication too! However, it can be fun to just have it right on hand. Oh he's a little nervous? Handy with lube! You're a little nervous? Either cover him in lube, or cover you in lube! The easier it is going in, the better time you'll both have.

You can also get variety packs of lube on Amazon to try out different types. They've got flavored ones, ones that go warm, ones that make you feel like a slip n slide (in a good way!) 

I can't personally speak towards the non-water based lubes, because I use non-latex condoms which means I can't mix them with oil based lubes. But the water based ones are super super easy to clean up. I like this one: www.amazon.com/Passion-Lubes-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant/dp/B00375LMRU/

The cranberries are an interesting thing. They've got mixed results for everyone. They'll work lovely for some people, and not at all for others. What they try and do is make the environment harder for bacteria to grow. If you've actually got an infection going on, the cranberries will do nothing. If you take a shot of cranberries daily? You might have a harsh enough environment to prevent it - but I'd take other precautions too. 

But honestly, arousal is going to be your best bet on enjoying this. Don't be nervous, and relax :)
