I don't know a ton about long term risks, besides that for many women it's fine to use indefinitely. Lowers your risk of certain uterine cancers, ovarian too. I know that having more periods in a lifetime increases the risk for certain cancers, so imagine this plays into it.

I use the shot, and that does have the long term risk of lowering your none density. Something to consider . It probably depends a little based on which method you're using. 

Nothing to be ashamed of, plenty of women use it long term. I'm going on year 7. I agree it's be nice if long term info was more available though. Hopefully someone can add to this!
