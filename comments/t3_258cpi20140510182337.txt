[Captain Awkward](http://captainawkward.com/2012/10/02/367-368-am-i-too-ugly-to-date/), one of my favorite advice columns, has answered a lot (A LOT) of questions from awesome people who are dating or want to date but have social anxiety, who are perhaps not "conventionally" attractive, people who are dealing with various illnesses, etc. and has a ton of scripts and tips (especially in the comments) about making conversation.

I've linked a column that I think might be relevant, but the dating tag on the blog is a goldmine. One of the points that Captain Awkward emphasizes is that rejection is a normal part of dating. It's easy to get discouraged and take it to heart, but dating is a numbers game. Maybe they won't hit it off, maybe she'll make a friend, maybe he won't be interested, maybe SHE won't be interested. That's okay. If this one doesn't work out, she can meet someone else. How easy it would be if we instantly clicked with the first person who came along, no?
