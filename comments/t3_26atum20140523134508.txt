I was in a cab last week in NYC (in Chelsea) and the cabbie was taking a left onto a small street. We were not in traffic and the roads were pretty clear as this was the middle of the afternoon. An elderly woman was in the crosswalk and still had "the walk" sign. For a woman of her age, she was walking pretty quickly, albeit hunched over. Suddenly, the cabbie slammed on his horn and shouted "COME ON!" out his window at her, scaring her. She walked a little quicker and the cab turned when she was clear. I immediately said to him, "why did you do that?" and he said "she was walking so slow and blocking the road!". I explained that she had the walk, and that she was elderly. I told him there was no need and I wasn't (for once) in a hurry to get to my destination. He started complaining about her, calling her stupid. Almost as if he was talking about a piece of property. It was most definitely because she was female. So I said, "I wouldn't treat anybody like that, much less someone of her age. I HOPE to be in that good of health when I'm her age, walking around NYC. She's probably someone's mother, someone's sister, someone's grandmother. Would you say those things to your grandmother?" He was quiet for the rest of the trip. I did not tip him.
