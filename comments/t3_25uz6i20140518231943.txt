HPV-induced ovarian cancer is the only cancer is currently preventable by a vaccine (Source: Medical school), so it is highly recommended.  The virus has many strains with some much worse than others (not all will induce cancer) and some that are transmitted orally (although most are STDs). Although you will probably not be at risk if you are both virgins, the vaccine is still worth seriously looking into. Also, don't fret so much about infections or the like; just be clean and use your common sense.
Congratulations on getting married!
