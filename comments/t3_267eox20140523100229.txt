> The unfair treatment of women is bad in and of itself so it should be highlighted and stamped out, but that has little to no bearing on the large gender gap in programming.

Seriously?  You think that the hostile environment has no effect on how many women go into and stay in programming?  You think that socialization has nothing to do with it?  This is the the kind of reasoning from people who have never experienced it and refuse to listen to those of us that does.  

Case in point that Scientific American *blog post.*  Your pseudo science of biological differences is unsubstantiated because *you can not separate culture from a subject in order to test accurately.*  It ignores and dismisses the very real experiences of those that can see how much the culture affects people - namely the disenfranchised that have to slog through it every day.  

>  I've explained why understanding biological differences between the sexes is practically necessary for creating an equal society

And I disagree with every single point you've made about it and have said over and over again that I'm unwilling to debate it with you.  How the fuck can you sit there and tell people they don't understand their own discrimination?  The source of discrimination women face is *based on believed upon biological differences.*  And that is not OK.  It is not OK every single time someone acts shocked that I code, am good it it and really enjoy it.  *Just because I am a woman* and gosh, women don't like that sort of thing.
