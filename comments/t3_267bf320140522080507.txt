It's not about them shouting the loudest, it's that anti-feminists try to cherry pick the worst sounding stuff (often out of context) and continually repeat it to show how horrible feminism is. Almost nobody would have even heard of things like the SCUM Manifesto if it wasn't for anti-feminists trying to use it as a tool against feminism.
