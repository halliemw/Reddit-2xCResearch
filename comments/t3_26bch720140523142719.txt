OK, "calling out" was the wrong word to use.  What I'm trying to say is that she defended herself and the boy was punished for doing something totally inappropriate.  Was the punishment disproportionate?  Yes, that's what I said, I *agree* with her BF on this point.  I do not think tackling him and kicking him in the balls was appropriate retribution for grabbing her boobs.

I think the OP's real issue is that coupled with the other incidents described, BF has a tendency to derail or invalidate her feeling of discomfort in these situations. The derail in #2 is *completely* understandable.  But I'd also sympathize with the discomfort and violation she felt and the sense of protection her friends felt, while being horrified by what they did as a result.  That's what I'm trying to articulate, I guess.
