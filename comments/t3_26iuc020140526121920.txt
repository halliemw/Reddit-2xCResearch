She shouldn't have conflated 'great motherhood' with time off. She probably would have been better off saying "I think I can be a better mum when I have time off". Instead what she's done is set down an absolute with the way she's phrased it. 

It's tricky, though, because you can't prefilter every single thing that you say, even as a celebrity. Sometimes associations like that are going to be said or made. I do hope that she doesn't literally think that it's not possible to be a great mother and work, though.
