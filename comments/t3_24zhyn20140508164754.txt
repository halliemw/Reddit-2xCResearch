Well considering that the Queen in Frozen says taht you can't marry a man you just met, as compared to the little mermaid where she gives up her life under the sea for a stranger it's a much better message for a young girl. In Brave the princess rides horses, shoots arrows, and knows how to sword fight. She doesn't get married at all.
