I too have never experienced any kind of sexual assault/harassment, but I just want to point out that someone can do all those things you do and STILL experience assault/harassment. I know a young woman who took the same bus as me. We live in a medium sized city. I've never had a problem with harassment taking public transportation here, but she had a man follow her home on multiple occasions. We weren't very different, but our experiences were. It's impossible for *anyone* to completely take control of a situation.
