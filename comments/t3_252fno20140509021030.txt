Yep, you got me. I'm a man. Not like I try and hide it. I do get it. I do understand. Again, my argument remains the same. Any perspective that provides helpful insight is welcome anywhere, or should be anyway. Gender exclusionary boards by and large are impossible on reddit as it's impossible to stop men from posting here, as I am. Short of just banning ALL men, which I don't think reddit permits that. However, I see that I'm repeating myself and so are you. So feel free to respond and repeat yourself once more, but I'm not going to respond again.
