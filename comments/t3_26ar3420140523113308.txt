Are you guys monogamous? If so you're making a change to the body that's the only body he is able to be sexually intimate with for the rest of his life. Why would his opinion on that body not matter? 

I don't think he should/does have control over your body, but he also has to look at it everyday. Why dismiss his opinion?
