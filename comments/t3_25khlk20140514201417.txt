This story is amazing, and I really do appreciate it. This gave me a new perspective on things, and that kind of knowledge is only obtained whenever people have the courage and the drive to share it. So really thank you.

If I can ask one question, or maybe even interject a little, you said that you've noticed that men tend to talk over you in conversations, and the way you wrote it made it seem like it was only men who do this. In my own personal experience the same thing happens to me whenever I try to participate in a group conversation that is  held by women. I have the same experience as you, just opposite. I tend to be talked over, and mostly ignored in female conversations. I think this is more of a social issue (being that same gender groups tend to ignore members of the other sex in group conversations) than just a male only thing. 

Best of luck to you, and again thank you for sharing.
