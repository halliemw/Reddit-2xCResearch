High five! 

It was in a research group that I actually learned to document and take detailed notes too! I wasn't big on the calling out, but I did take everything to the professor and explain exactly what was going on. I was a lot less confrontational when I was younger. 

Your story is awesome! I'm so happy it has such a good ending. Lab books are amazing, I wish more people used them. (Even in retail, it saved my butt several times.)
