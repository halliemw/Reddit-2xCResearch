>Mindstorms which are the programmable variety of LEGO) so maybe they've dumbed down the unisex ones too.

No, they still sell mindstorms but those are hella expensive, just like the Technic sets.

I think there's just far more variety these days is all, when lego first came out there were like 6 colors and 6 different blocks.

Now there's all kinds of sets ranging from StarWars to Comic hereos to Harry Potter, LoTR, and even Minecraft.
