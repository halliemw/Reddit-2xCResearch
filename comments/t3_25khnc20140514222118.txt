We have an office rule of "wear what you feel comfortable in" one of my co-workers wears business casual most days, and a suit sometimes, whereas I am usually in jeans/polo or less, sometimes in athletic shorts, a t-shirt, and flip flops.  Wear what you want to wear if there's no minimum. IMO, it's perfectly fine for her to wear that.

EDIT: Also, wtf @ makeup makes you overdressed.  That's absurd.
