Feminism is about equal rights for both men and women by dismantling and critiquing the gender norms that have set up the system we have now. This means looking at why women are encouraged to be mothers and nurturing, but also why men are discouraged from doing the same. It is, overwhelmingly, about equality, not about dismissing one sex or the other and certainly not about further oppressing people.

I'm sure you've met feminists before. Most of us aren't loud about it, but you're in the right place if you'd like to know more. :)

EDIT: Thank you very much to the kind person who gave me gold!
