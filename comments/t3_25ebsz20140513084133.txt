This is really great advice. I started a PhD program and got through two years when several big pieces of reality hit me:

- I didn't like the feeling of constantly, always having something I 'ought' to be doing. I recognized that this is something that would continue in many ways if I got my PhD and became a professor. The schedule is flexible, but it's also constant - you can always be publishing more or reading more. 
- The idea of a job where I had scheduled tasks and a scheduled quit time appealed to me more than a job where I had to be self-motivated to set my own schedule and my own tasks.
- I learned more about the realities of the job market. They were dire. And I didn't want to have to move wherever I could get someone to pay me. 
- I learned more about the realities of the job, in particular of the situation of adjuncts and the tenure race. None of it appealed to me. 
- I felt trapped in limbo because of the 'I don't know where I'll be in 5 years' thing and was eager to settle into a career. 

These details will of course vary according to what you're studying, what you want to do with your degree (academia isn't the only option), what your priorities are, and what you enjoy doing. 

Some of the things that were cons for me are giant pros for other people. 

But the reality is that a lot of us end up in grad school because school is what we've always been good at. The reality is also that a lot of things are changing for PhD holders - so even the advice you get from your mentors may not be accurate any longer. 

You definitely shouldn't feel weird for questioning it (lots of people do - quick fact: of the 9 or so people I hung out with in my cohort, 1 is still in grad school (7 years after I left), 1 has his PhD, and the rest all left to pursue other things), and you should decide based on the strengths of your pros and cons.
