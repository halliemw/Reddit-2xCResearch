You're very welcome! Hit me like a ton of bricks when I first read it! 

I would consider myself strong, independent, and all that good stuff; but boy was I not able to see how sneaky, and insidious an emotionally/psychologically abusive relationship could be! Until you're mired in one you don't think it could happen to you.

I learned so much about myself though, and had a few years alone to grow and just work my way back to me. (Which I needed too, trust issues come when you surround yourself with people you can't trust just to surround yourself with people! Haven't bothered with that in many years!)

And wow, that realization that I WASN'T crazy (or alone) was cathartic! Good luck! :)
