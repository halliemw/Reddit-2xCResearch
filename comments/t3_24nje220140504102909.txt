There's a whole lot of frowney faces in that wall of text. Stop that if you really want to help your sister. Yeah, there's not a lot you can say to make cramps feel better. But puberty doesn't have to be depressing! It's just some things that happen. She'll already have it all figured out when a lot of girls are dealing with their first periods. It sounds like you guys are preparing for periods, which is good. Make sure there are smaller pads and tampons around if she needs them (maybe even the Tampax U brand, which is a little more colorful and less clinical than regular tampons). I'd agree with the other comments on taking her to the doctor to make sure everything's on-track, but it sounds like she's actually doing pretty well. Yes, she's crying, but she realizes she'll be fine after she gets it out of her system. She seems to be handling the changes okay, from what you're describing. Just let her know that you're always there to talk if she needs you (which it sounds like she already knows).
