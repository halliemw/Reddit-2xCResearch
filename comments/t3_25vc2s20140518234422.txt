Haha! I'm sure every time you were like "oh great, this shit again!" I'm lucky enough to have not run out of gas until after cell phones were widely available and used. I learned our new-to-us car could go exactly 27.5 miles with the gas light on, and not a quarter mile further. I had three kids in car seats, and thank God my grandparents lived 3 miles away from where the car stopped!
