Yes about insurance. I'm currently on my parent's insurance and have a full time job that offers insurance once I am not able to be on my parent's anymore.

I'm pretty responsible but if I'm 100% honest I am pretty forgetful. This isn't going to be my only form of birth control. Bf wears condoms every time but we've started into a not so good habit of feeling it out without one. So I figured getting on bc just in case would make it a better experience for both of us so we wouldn't have to worry.

As for other symptoms, no. I have been really lucky with my periods being regular, very minimal cramping, minimal acne, etc. My interest in birth control would be for the reason above-- being able to be "irresponsible" with out being actually being irresponsible/ having the risks associated with it.
