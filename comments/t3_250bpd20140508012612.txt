The gender disparity is a problem, I agree. However, that doesn't mean she isn't breaking the dress code. Two wrongs don't make a right. And I'm sorry but that skirt is too damn short. My teacher wouldn't have had to say anything because my mom would have told me to put on some damn clothes before leaving the house for school. I think we are all forgetting that this is a CHILD. Maybe I'm just getting old but seriously... The skirt is too short. Cover up. End of story. And as for the poster who posted about male teachers being put in a potentially career ruining situation, I totally agree. If I was a male teacher I'd send someone to change for that. I'm not taking any chances.
