It's normal for breasts to grow quickly - the summer between the end of grade school and the start of high school, we joked that a lot of the girls went away to 'boob camp' because they had nothing in the spring and a full bust in the fall!
Regarding your mom, she may have been thinking that your bra experience should be the same as what hers was at that age. My mom wouldn't buy me a bra at all - she said that girls my age 'didn't need them' and that it was 'bad for your breasts to wear one'. Great for her - she's a B cup at best. I was at least a C, and got harassed like crazy because I 'bounced' when I walked. I ended up getting a summer job specifically so I would have my own money (in my province, you could work at 13 as long as you had your Social Insurance Number).
How will people treat you in high school? Just like they would if you hadn't grown breasts. Some people will be jerks and make comments, some will hit on you - but some will be your friends, some won't even really notice your boobs, and some people won't be attracted to you because of them (e.g. guys who are 'leg men'). If you hadn't sprouted breasts, there would be something else about you that would make people make fun of you or hit on you - or just like you for who you are.

TL;DR - you're perfectly normal, and I'm sorry you can't have this conversation with your mom.
