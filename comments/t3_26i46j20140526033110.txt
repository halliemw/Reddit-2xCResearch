Hi there, if you have any specific questions or concerns relating breast reductions join us over on /r/reduction.  
I'm 3 months post op and would never go back. Sure people notice, but I'm so happy now that it doesn't bother me. I'm no longer embarrassed by my breasts.   
No one has ever told me (seriously) that I should be ashamed of my decision or that I've done something wrong either! A lot of people are just happy that I'm happy.
