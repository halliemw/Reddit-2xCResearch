I agree with this and was not trying to imply that tests didn't matter, just that its more productive to learn and move on from a test than to get hung up on one bad grade. What I did to push myself from high school through graduate school was after each test I would write what I thought I could have done better to prepare for that test and then make sure to look over that list before studying for the next one. But always worrying about single instances in high school seems destructive in the larger scope of ones life.
