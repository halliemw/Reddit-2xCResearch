Thanks for sharing!  Question: I had heard (from a FTM trans friend) that one of the things he was surprised by was how he was surprised at how often people spoke to him like he was supposed to know things, compared to when he was female.  Everything from, "Can you help me change this tire?" to "what time is it?" - he was just expected to know way more than it seemed females are assumed to know.  Have you noticed this in reverse?  Like people not only talk over you, but [even strangers] assume you know things?
