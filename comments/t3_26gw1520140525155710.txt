Youtube has a ton of tutorials on different kids of bathing suits. Here's a tip too. If it's hard to find a cheep bra in your size a 30DDD is a 32DD or a 34D and so on. Because while the band size changes however the volume of the cup does not. Go find a clearance bra and sew the sides of the bra so it will fit your torso then use swim fabric (or dance fabric, it's all just spandex to be honest) to cover it. Also make sure to try the bra on. Just because bras are special snowflakes since the fashion industry refuses to regulate sizes.
