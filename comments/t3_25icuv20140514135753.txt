I completely agree. It wasn't acceptable for him to try to be physical with you in that situation, but at the same time, there's so much we don't know about the situation that it seems very extreme to advocate shouting this out to everyone in that subreddit before having communicated with the guy *at all*. 

To OP:

As you say, you were drunk, he may have been drunk, and alcohol certainly contributes to the making of mistakes. If he is a good person, then he will apologize. If he becomes defensive and denies responsibility, then it's time to alert others in your group. But making him a pariah in a community he cares enough about to organize these kinds of outings because he *might* have touched you sexually in full knowledge that you are in a relationship? That's pretty extreme.

It would be a different thing altogether if this guy was a complete stranger who approached you out of the blue, or if he had tried to push things further, or if he had persisted in touching you after you told him to stop (which you say you don't remember if you did). Then you should have no qualms about making sure he doesn't have an opportunity to violate others' physical safety.
