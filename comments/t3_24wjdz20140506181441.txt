He is very grudgingly "willing" to talk with me. But when it actually comes time, he'll act all angry and seething and will do what he did in the emails (bring up how what I am saying hurts him) and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I never get my own problems solved cause I'm so busy bending over backwards to make sure I don't hurt his feelings when I tell him he hurt me.
