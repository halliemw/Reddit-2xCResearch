So I've written about my experience here before, but I had a fairly similar take on my options under the circumstances as you, in that I couldn't raise a child and I couldn't see myself being strong enough to bear one and then give it up.

I would suggest that you consider having a close friend take you there and bring you back, especially if there's any possibility he's going to make you feel judged right after. Your hormones might be all over the place, and that may not be a time for someone telling you your abandoning and rejecting a piece of him.

Good luck and hugs, things will get better.
