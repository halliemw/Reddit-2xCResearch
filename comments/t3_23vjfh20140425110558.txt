I'm going to tackle this from a personal finance point of view: $200 is a lot of money at one time, but if you've got a small amount of income,  after the next time you get it (unfortunately this isn't much help now), you could put aside a small portion a month that will add up to what you need when you need it. Is seasonique taken every four months? Putting aside $50 a month can be a lot more manageable than dropping $200 at once. If seasonique is taken less frequently than that, even better!
