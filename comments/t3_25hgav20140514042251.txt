I was homeschooled too. People automatically expect my parents to be religious whackos when they hear I was a homeschool student from the deep South raised by my farmer parents. It's actually the complete opposite though. My mom is a feminist and non-religious and didn't want the conservative attitudes of the local public schools rubbed off on her kid.
