Like so many others are saying, it is wonderful that this discussion is happening, and that, as partners, the two of you are able to come to a decision that you think you both can live with. 

That said, I've carried a baby to term and placed her with an incredible and loving family that I got to know during the pregnancy. I am honored to be able to continue that relationship with them to this day (five years later). We keep in close contact, and I get to visit them every once in a while (I moved out-of-state, otherwise it would be more frequent). It was not an easy decision, but it was the right one at that time. 

Two years ago, I had another unplanned pregnancy (fucking Nuva Ring does not work, people!), and decided with my partner to have an abortion. Again, not an easy decision, but it was the right one at that time. 

In my experience, being confident in my decision to have an abortion  is a million times easier than choosing adoption, and I truly believe that my adoption journey has been the easiest and most loving scenario possible. This may seem shocking, but it is my truth. 

I just want you to remember that talking hypothetically is great and these conversations between partners should occur more frequently...but how you feel when you may actually be pregnant could very well be different than how you THINK you may feel now. And that's okay! Just be gentle with yourself, and your partner (as his desires might change too).
