While your privacy was violated, I think you should definitely take this as a learning experience in that any message you send (text/e-mail/internet message) is NOT private and NOT safe from others reading. I'm not saying that you shouldn't feel frustrated, but in the future a phone call or in-person meeting is probably a better way to go if you really want privacy.
