Wow, are you on crack? So you're saying if I'm walking by a construction site and some guy says "nice tits" I should smile, wave, and take it as a compliment? Bitch please. I'm not there for them. Even if it wasn't something vulgar, their attention is unwanted. I didnt ask for their opinion on my appearance. I am not an object. You should be embarrassed for victim blaming and condoning the actions of the harassers.
