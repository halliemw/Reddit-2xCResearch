I was early in some ways (flat and then a B cup practically overnight, at age 11) but didn't get my period until I was 13.

I just want to say, as an older sister (7 year age difference), my sister was visibly relieved when I came to talk to her about "period stuff," etc. Not that my mom didn't do a good job, but I could add my personal experience to it (I got my period in 8th grade, the first time I ever wore a thong to school) and when they're young, everything mom and dad say is "sooo embarrassing". While your mom says she will give her the talk, I don't think there's any harm in giving her your own version, I think she will be more open with you and ask more questions she may feel too embarrassed to ask mom. Just remind her it's something we all go through, she's not a freak, and if she seems particularly nervous about it, you can make her a little emergency kit to keep in her backpack (like one of those little metal boxes for tea, to hold panty liners and the "teen" size tampons with instructions).

You sound like a pretty great big sister.
