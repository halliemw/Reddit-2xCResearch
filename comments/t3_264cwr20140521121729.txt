Yeah, it's a joke and I had a husband who did this all the time, and it got old.  Very.  Especially after the birth of two daughters.  It was just part of an overall pattern of disregard for my feelings and my being though.

Let me ask you something.  How does he do in other departments.  Does he help with cooking and housework?  Does he have any clue what you would like, come birthdays and other holidays?  Does he show that he actually knows who you are, at all?  Because my experience with men like this is that they really are thrilled to have a female presence in their lives, but not because we are human individuals.
