In high school there was one girl who would constantly try to pick on me verbally. I just responded with humor because after knowing she was a bully I didn't care for her opinion. I had no idea almost the entire school hated me. By a few grades in, my response to her had earned respect from some of the most popular people and they started standing up for me sometimes. She got WORSE because of that.

She called me a slut once and I just wondered what rumour it was now... then a very popular boy asked her why, and when she said it was because I was wearing leggings, he got really annoyed with her over it. I was laughing because it's impossible to be a slut when you're still a virgin! So then after that it was all over the school that I was a virgin and this girl was just being a hater for no reason. (Though it shouldn't be anyone's business who is or isn't a slut and if people are sluts just be ethical with it.)

For her specifically... it's tough when you're out of step with everyone around you, but that's what gives you value outside of high school. Think about Lorde - 17, being called ugly and hated on, but a hit record just out of high school? Making how much bank?

Sometimes, as much as it sucks, being hated on lets you focus on what's really important and not lose sight of that in the fluff of life.

People may have hated me, but when I left that school, there were 11 French Horn players in Grade 9, all brothers and sisters of people I'd gone to school with. They saw me playing it and decided it was the coolest instrument ever. That was unbelievable to me, the power of standing up and saying "yes I'm weird, so what?" while just doing my music thing.

"Hold on, hang in there, and keep looking for the people of your tribe."

Maybe for an in to talk about this with your sister, discuss Lauryn Hill. http://patrickwanis.com/blog/lauryn-hill-addiction-sabotage-bullying-and-exploitation-the-miseducation/
