Someone linked [this](http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/03/30/why-does-he-do-that/) here yesterday. I'm out of an abusive relationship (well, sadly I got into two of them, you'd think I'd learn not to get into one again but I didn't). Either way, this book really helped me understand what I went through a lot better.
