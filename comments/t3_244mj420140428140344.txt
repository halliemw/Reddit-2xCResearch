Thank you for the reply. 

Yeah I've been wanting to do this for a year and it won't happen for a little while and now I'm in an amazing relationship and I guessed it would take a while for me to get something steady or permanent but I worry about how donation would affect sex life because we both like sex a lot but then I think it wouldn't be that much different from a baby... or a summer away etc, we could make it work.
