I don't like the way she implies that real life doesn't include being thin or reading fiction for fun. Just because taking care of twins while having a gut and stretch marks is your reality for now doesn't mean it's what growing up is all about. I'm 33, have no kids, read whatever I want, and take care of my body, and I am very much an adult.
