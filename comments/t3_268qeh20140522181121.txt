I understand not wanting to be a jerk, but you need to start separating yourself from the company.

I work for a small-ish company and am literally invested in their success through bonuses and other financial incentives. As they succeed so do/will I. I put in long work weeks off and on to get the job done, but I have set boundaries on what I'm willing to do. 

We have one employee who is a minority investor in the company and he works crazy hours, works on his vacation, etc. But he owns a part of the company. If you didn't own part of that company, you aren't invested to the point of working those hours.
