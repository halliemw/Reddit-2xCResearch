Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the wage gap sort of irrelevant, since it takes everybody's job and gets an average out of that? The main issue is that there are more men who are pushed into higher paid jobs while women are encouraged into more social sectors (teachers etc)

Not saying this isn't sexist in itself, but if you compare a man and a woman working in the same field and working equal hours, I think it's been shown that women are actually paid slightly more. 

No?
