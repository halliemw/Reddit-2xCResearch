Embarrassingly, it didn't even occur to me that I'd messed that bit up until I went to squat for the first time.

I've thought about either moving the mat away or cutting further into it and moving the mat more towards the wall, and will probably do one of those at some point. When I lift the weight off and step forward there is plenty of room to squat, but it's not dead center so definitely not ideal.
