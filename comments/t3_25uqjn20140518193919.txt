Even just the compliment can be a tough spot at work. 

You go to a grocery store and there is a woman at the cash register. You tell her you think she's beautiful. 

Maybe on your end this is just you being nice. You only see her once a week when you go buy groceries. You thought she was pretty so you let her know. It might brighten her day. You have absolutely no expectations of her and you don't say anything else out of the ordinary to her. It's completely innocent and harmless.

On *her* end, however, she checks out a hundred people a day, half of which are men. A good chunk of those men figure that trying to flirt with her that one day a week they see her is no big deal. None of them realize that they're not the ONLY one making advances, and those advances range from sweet and benign to sexual and inappropriate and all the way on to scary and dangerous. 

Your "beautiful" comment to going to be different to her than it is to you. To her, there's a good chance that this is going to escalate and encourage you to be more aggressive if she's polite to you and you get the wrong idea and think she's flirting. If she's rude, though, she might get written up or fired. Either situation can lead to real danger / being stalked.

Even though YOUR comment was completely innocent, she has no way of knowing that because she doesn't know *anything* about you and has no reason to just trust that you're a good person with good intentions, especially when other people have not had good intentions in the past. 

You have all of the power in that situation. She can't embarrass you or she's in trouble. She'll most likely be polite and courteous to you. She has no safe bet and no real recourse. You can just walk away and she can't.
