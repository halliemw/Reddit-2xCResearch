How would I even start that conversation? I feel like bringing it up will make it worse. Like, it's private, it's his problem. I don't want to suddenly point it out and have him think that he needs to bottle it up again or even worse he could shut me out.

I like being his safe space. I like being the only one that he shows this side to. I treasure the trust he gives me, but I also want to be able to help him with his problems and I don't know how
