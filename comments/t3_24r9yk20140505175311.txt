I was blitzed on my wedding night.  Like, so gone, it was really bad and I am really embarrassed about it.  We were at our house and our guests sent us off to bed and I got into the bedroom and I apparently asked my husband if we were at a hotel.

He laid me down, kissed me goodnight and we had sex the next day instead, because I was way too drunk to be capable of any sort of informed consent.  I didn't know where I was or how long I'd been there, or why my dress was ripped... (Sloppy as fuck).

Cheers to good men.
