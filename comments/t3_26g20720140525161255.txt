If you're really nervous, you can try a more basic form of grooming than tweezing. Just get an eyebrow comb, and brush the hairs upward. You'll still be able to see the shape of where your eyebrows should be. Then take a small pair of scissors (I use a pair on a Swiss Army knife, but they also make them for eyebrows) and trim them off along the line. Then you can brush downward and repeat. This way they won't be all unruly and they'll stay basically in the shape they're meant to be in. It doesn't REPLACE tweezing, but it's a good place to start.
