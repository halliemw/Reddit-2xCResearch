Ok so before I heard the no sex and no living together thing I thought "that's pretty normal to be thinking/talking about marriage someday" However you are talking about making a life long commitment to someone you've known for 6 months, never been intimate with and never lived with? Horrific idea. 

Here's what I'd look at. If you could have sex before being married and or live together before being married would you be in such a rush?
