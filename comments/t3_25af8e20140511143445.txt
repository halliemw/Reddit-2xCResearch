Consider this: Anna Jarvis is the one responsible for creating Mother's Day in the United States and the first one was in 1910.  By 1914 it was instituted as a national holiday and became so highly commercialized that Anna Jarvis even called it a "Hallmark holiday".  Don't let the mind games get to you.
