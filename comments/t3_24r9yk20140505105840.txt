Kindly refrain from putting words in my mouth.

My comment refers to the OPs story, in this individual scenario- she enjoyed herself throughout the entire process from start to end, which was all consensual. No part of my comment implies what you are saying it does... if someone consents while drunk and regrets it later, that is called regret, not rape.
