Man chiming in.  a 1/4 sleeve tattoo that wouldn't be visible while wearing just about any form of uniform/dress code applicable shirt...should be your decision.   I've never worked at a place where discreet tattoos were an issue.  If the only objection hubby has is that it might affect future employment, then that is specious at best.


At my current workplace, two of my current supervisory team are females with visible tattoos.   One is a PK and the most conservative person in my department.   She's also the hiring manager.   I work for a multi-billion dollar company with over 12k employees.
