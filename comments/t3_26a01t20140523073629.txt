I can't offer you too much help on what to do in the matter but given she is at a young age, it might be a good idea to explain to her that she is different from her peers and they are responding to her being different with hostility. It will do NOTHING about the bully situation but hopefully she will never ever think that it is because there is something wrong with her. Auditioning for a play? That is awesome! Explain to her that kids are stupid and get jealous and then address the bully situation as best as you can. I like Octoberaeowyn's suggestion to lock down her social media accounts. 

The reason I think this might help is because, up to a certain age, my parents wouldn't let me or my sister watch Bollywood movies. They have entertainment value but are generally really sappy love stories that glorify people with poor morals. These movies are REALLY popular in my country and everyone watches them. You are an outcast if you don't know about the latest one. Since we didn't have movies, we read books. It was awful and I didn't have anyone who would explain to me why people thought reading a thick English book in high school made me a freak (english is not the first language in my country)
