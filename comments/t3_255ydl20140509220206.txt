I also moved to a new city about 18 months ago, and the best thing I've found is to do something regularly to get you out of the house. Show up to the same drop-in yoga/wine/jewelry/knitting/scotch/fly fishing/doggie obedience class every Saturday, become a regular on Friday nights at the local roller rink - anything that interests you enough to do it weekly, where other humans might see you week-to-week.

Just develop a routine. Become a familiar face, and people will eventually approach you, because you will have shown that you're at least some version of stable, and have a consistent, shared interest with them. 

Once that ice is broken, it's a little easier. You can talk about the drama that went down the week before, then the next week you ask if they want to meet up for coffee or something - and slowly you become friends, or best case, they invite you into their existing circle. 

Good luck!!
