You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved, so don't try. 

Ask her over for wine or coffee and a movie (or something you normally do when you hang out together). When she is relaxed and comfortable, ask "Sarah, can we talk about Steve?" 

Don't put down her boyfriend, don't bring up *your* past experiences, just emphasize that you're worried about her safety based on some things she's told you. The key is to ask questions and to *listen*. (ex. "Didn't you tell me that last week, Steve called you a fat cunt?"..."If I was dating someone like Steve, what would you tell me to do?"..."Have you ever thought that Steve might be capable of physical violence?) Don't tell her to leave him, but emphasize that if she ever did, you would help her.

If she gets defensive or shuts down, just end the conversation and say, "I'm sorry to upset you. I just want you to know that I'm there for you, and you can always come to me if you need help or want to talk." 

If you notice signs of bruises or physical abuse, document them (take photos) and call a domestic violence hotline.
