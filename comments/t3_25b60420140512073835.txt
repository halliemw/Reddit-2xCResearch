>Breastmilk doesn't come out like a geyser. 

Not only that, but I've seen plenty of women breastfeeding in public, and they've all been fairly discreet. They're not exactly swinging their tits around and slapping people with them. The most you'll see is a bit of side boob and a kid's head. Oh no, the horrors!
