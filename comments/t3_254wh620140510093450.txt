Let me just add this: we think of 'troll comments' as being made by people explicitly trying to be awful, because they are bad people, and will not change.  However, my view is that many of these comments actually come from young or ignorant people who grew up in a place where these attitudes were considered appropriate/laudable/funny, and they're actually trying to contribute.  I believe that in many of these cases, the act of putting those opinions in a public forum and getting yelled at, mocked, downvoted, and banned for them actually *can* lead to self-reflection, realization, and change.

I've seen it happen.
