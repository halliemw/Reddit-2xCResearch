As a woman completing bachelor's degrees in engineering and science right now in male-dominated classes, I've never experienced any sort of discrimination (even though my specialisations are in fields which historically have the lowest F:M ratios). My experience has been that most people will judge you on your confidence and intelligence rather than your skill. I've not once had a single derogatory comment thrown in my direction in all my three-and-a-half years of math, physics and engineering classes (I do get the occasional 'haha you're a woman' joke, but the guys telling them tend to stop once they see my class marks :P). So it's certainly not inevitable that you'll be discriminated against because of your gender. Hold your head up high, be confident, and you will do just fine.
