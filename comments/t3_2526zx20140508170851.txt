>wouldn't like to hear "you don't get it because you're a man" without a valid explanation for instance

There are many, many things that cannot be genuinely understood without experience.  The experience of being challenged by men on the validity of viewpoints and internal experiences that are obvious to and commonly shared by women but completely alien to anything men can relate to is one women have to deal with constantly, whenever men are around.  As long as a man doesn't understand something, he continues to demand a "valid explanation" as though anything he can't comprehend is invalid.  (Yes, obviously, some men are not like that.  Not very many though, especially here on Reddit, where the social skills are, on average, even worse than in the population at large.)  It's the lack of that need for defensiveness that makes this community worthwhile.

This isn't the women-explaining-obvious-shit-to-men subreddit.  This subreddit is, first and foremost, *for women*.

Now perhaps that isn't what you meant, and if so, I do apologize.  The phrase "valid explanation" in this context makes me see red.
