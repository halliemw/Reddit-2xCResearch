Eeep! Yeah, my doctors have wanted me to switch from the estrogen pills for similar reasons, thus my stint with the minipill. I too get migraines, and recently I've gotten a couple with auras... arg. I'm considering the implant-medication, but I'm worried I'll have the same breast-issue... and I'm scared of losing my chest... It's not much, but it's mine. Friggen... migraines...
