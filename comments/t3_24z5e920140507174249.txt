Your expertise and your ability to move up isn't related to your age. I've seen university grads grow past long time employees within a couple of years after they were hired because they put out quality work. If you want to move up, work harder than other people there, show that you are committed to the company, show that you care about your job and you are not just in it for the money. Take initiative, if you see an inefficiency, try to think of a way to fix it. Always remember, at any point in time, the company has the exact dollar figure that you cost them, and the exact dollar figure that you've made for them in revenues regardless of whether you generated that revenue directly or indirectly. This next part I'm adding in hopes of adding a little bit of credibility to my post. I work in the accounting department of a corporation, and we have workbooks and spreadsheets for years worth of cost vs. revenues for each employee. The cost of each employee is significantly higher than the amount of money that they get in their bank accounts periodically. The cost is their GROSS income plus the employer portion of statutory deductions, plus benefits which include cellphones, cars, overtime, retirement plans etc. 

 I'm not sure why you felt the need to mention that the majority of your coworkers are male, that has absolutely nothing to do with anything. Are you saying that if your workplace was primarily women, you would have a better chance of moving up? In my experience, women in heavily male industries get raises a lot faster than the men because the company wants to hold on to the woman in the company so that they don't get accused of being sexist, so they will pay more.
