Ugh I totally hear you. People argue with me, "oh well they added women to the show." Ugh hello! They added *girlfriends*. The writers are so bad that there are no other roles for women on that show other than girlfriend or a mother figure or an  actual mother.

Yeah and a lot of the science is pretty mainstream too, or they pick really obscure stuff on purpose so that they seem edgy and smart. To me that show is just one big male nerd ego stroke. Bleh.
