I'm overreacting? You're the one who got all offended because someone said "husband hunting" and a mob wasn't immediately formed to squelch it. 

Incidentally, your observations about what gets up-voted in this subreddit do not have enough authority to be taken as facts about this subreddit. You have not demonstrated any expertise on the matter. How is someone like me supposed to tell the difference between your out-of-context meta discussion railing against the community and an observer who's reacting to some internalized slight who wants to support their own biases? There is nothing here to distinguish between the two.

How do I know that you are someone who can tell the difference between receiving down-votes for communicating poorly and receiving them from an unreasonable communal homogeneity?
