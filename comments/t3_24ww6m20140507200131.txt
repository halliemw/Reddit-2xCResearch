Never in my life have I realised how much entitlement this sub-reddit has until this message...  You were in a car (when did outside a car become 'personal space'?).  What happens if he'd be stabbed?  Should he just die?  How about if he thought if he didn't eat tonight he'd die?  Should he just die or try his hand (remember he WAITED UNTIL YOU WERE IN THE CAR)?

Maybe it'd be nicer if all the parts of society you don't agree with could do so out of your vision, right?  I imagine you get annoyed that blacks won't sit at the back of the bus, right - away from your 'DO NOT APPROACH ME' eyes?

In the UK we get embarrassed when we can't give a tramp money.  We don't pretend to feel violated...
