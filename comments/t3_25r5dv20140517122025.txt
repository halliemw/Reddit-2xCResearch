In her job, she probably needs to learn to get over things quickly (or at least, act as if she has - she's an actor, probably wants to keep those skills at the forefront).

I'm guessing that daily life on a movie set can be fraught with experiences that an accomplished actor will not let upset them.

However, I feel badly that in a moment that should have been triumphant for her (and where she might have been a bit anxious, etc), that this jerk did this.  He chose a stunt that could only be pulled on a woman - and possibly, wouldn't even have worked well with any other woman.  

It was *her* moment, for which she worked really hard, and his only accomplishment is leeching off of others' fame and hard work.  

How did this person become famous?  (I've never heard of him; he should be banned from Cannes, etc., for life).
