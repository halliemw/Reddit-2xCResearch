I didn't even click the link for the audio.  I don't appreciate media outlets promoting divisiveness or judgment among women, or anyone for that matter, over appearance (or anything). Life is hard enough without a radio talkshow host weighing in on what you put on your body. 

I seriously hope this sub Reddit becoming a default is not going to bring more of this kind of gross attempted marketing.
