This was absolutely riveting, thank you for sharing it with us. I was nodding along in agreement to most of it, the men talking over you thing was like 'SING IT, SISTER!' :D

Male/female dynamics fascinate me, so it's lovely to hear from someone who's seen both sides. 

A quick question though, feel free to ignore it  - you mention being sexually attracted to women, but you mention a boyfriend. Do you consider yourself gay? Or straight? Or fluid? :)
