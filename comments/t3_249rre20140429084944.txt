I see what you're saying but you can have nice father daughter bonding and not imply sexual connotation(like cotillion). I think the issue the author is trying to point out is that there is a very large part of that culture which devotes itself to prizing a womens virginity above all else. This leads to issues down the road where women may have a negative view of sex because they've been told their whole life it makes them dirty or unclean.

I think the second issue is the that of the father "standing in for the husband" in a metaphorical way. It's the whole men as protectors of women's virginity thing, it's kind of like saying women don't have the autonomy to make those decisions themselves.
