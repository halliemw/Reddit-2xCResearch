>How do you gain respect in a relationship?

You don't GAIN respect, you should demand respect in a relationship.

It sounds like you have been a passive participant in this relationship and it is time for you to stand up for yourself.

Everything is fine in the relationship because he doesn't have to do anything to keep it going, you are the one who is being "the Pleaser" and he is very happy to be the "Receiver"

A common dynamic seen within couples is that one partner tends to please while the other tends to receive (the giver and the taker). 

These opposites attract each other, because they are complementary and each partner needs to develop some of the qualities of the other side. If each partner becomes more one-sided and excessive in giving or taking, the relationship becomes more and more oppressive and unsatisfying. Ideally, both partners give and receive whole-heartedly for the right reasons without any strings attached.

Pleasers need to learn to ask for and receive what they desire from others. There really can be no true giving unless givers take care of themselves and are able to receive as well. They also need to develop the ability to let others take care of themselves on occasion, and to make sure their giving has no sense of reciprocal obligation or neediness attached.

People who are people pleasers do so because they want to be liked â€“ and usually they want to be respected along with this. However the reality is often unfortunately that they in fact lose respect from being so giving. People see people pleasers as pushovers, as doormats and as people with no backbone. Thus they will tend not to think highly of them, or to respect them
