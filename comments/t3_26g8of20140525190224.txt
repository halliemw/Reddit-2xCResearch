There are clearly misogynistic references throughout the manifesto. I think one could make a very credible case that he was a misogynist.

There's a lot of other things too, and there is no doubt much, much more yet to be considered from the crime itself (heck, had they even determined if he'd shot himself by the time this article was written?), let alone all of the mental health interventions. Describing the killings as "misogynist extremism" implies that the misogyny was the root cause of the killings. It's the point behind Michael Moore's "Bowling" straw man: plenty of facts to tie in to the assertion, but every pundit in the world is trying to frame the context before _anyone_ (let alone the pundits) really understands what are the most critical factors.
