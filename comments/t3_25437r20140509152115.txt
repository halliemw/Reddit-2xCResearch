Good for you, I'm just about to do the same thing as well. Doing my last exam on this coming Tuesday. I have massive respect to anyone that comes out the other side and finishes it - people that haven't been students before don't really understand just how much stress, exhaustion, and emotion goes in to completing a degree, no matter what you study. Last year was my final year and I went through a massive bout of depression and got in a pretty bad place, all because I couldn't handle the stress involved, as well as the lack of money and rent/bills, and generally asking myself every day what the point of it all was. So I quit, but came back the next year, which is what I'm finishing now. So I understand how hard it can be to do this kinda stuff. Just think, you'll never have to do another exam or dissertation again!! I'm imagining my graduation like a sort of re-birthing, where I can close that chapter and start a new one, start my life over again living it the way *I* want to. Serious congratulations, and I hope you enjoy all the many chapters to come.
