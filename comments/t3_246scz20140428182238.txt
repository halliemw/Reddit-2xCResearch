It does pass the Bechdel test, I saw it today. There are scenes with two named woman talking about a dog, about the dating scene, about another woman, about decorating, etc. Nothing hugely important, but it definitely does pass.

The main problem is that the plot is about getting revenge on a cheating husband. Any scene that isn't about furthering the plot is extraneous, so most conversations revolve around the cheating husband. You could include lots of scenes unrelated to the plot where the characters philosophize about all sorts, but this is a romcom, not a Tarantino movie.

It really is shitty, though.
