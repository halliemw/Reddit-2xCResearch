I think it might just be people with their knickers in a twist about 2X being default. Everything in the new queue is getting way more downvotes than new posts used to, and comments are also more likely to get downvotes right now. 

Also, a lot of people don't like affirmative action. This article actually mentions a woman saying that she also didnt agree with it, and then interacted with women who really really grateful to see that women could actually be in that kind of position. So you might get a downvote or two from people who hate affirmative action and didn't read the article (so think you're just promoting affirmative action for the sake of it rather than discussing something put in the article.)

Don't worry about it. You're not offensive, and this is the right kind of content for 2X.
