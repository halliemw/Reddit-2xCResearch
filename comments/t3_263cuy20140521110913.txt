I think what you need is a friend. I do not think you are being boring expressing your likes and interests. People are a lot more common than you think. You are overanalyzing the situation and need to just go meet them. I used to like the forced settings, but have grown accustomed to free flow. Those things are definitely enough to start a friendship over. You need to define for yourself what an acquaintance is versus friend.
