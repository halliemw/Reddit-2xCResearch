I've made this post in a few similar threads lately, but have you measured yourself using the guide/calculator at /r/abrathatfits? Often shoulder and back pain can be resolved, or at least reduced, with a better fitting bra. A 32E (10E) is made for someone with an underbust of 32" and a bust of 38", so if your measurements don't match up with those then there may well be a better size for you that could at least help you with the pain in the mean time (I'm definitely not trying to push you away from a reduction if that's what you want!).

I second the suggestion to check out /r/reduction, too :)
