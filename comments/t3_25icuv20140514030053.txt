If you don't consider it cute then maybe you shouldn't have ended your personal experience with "i don't drink these days ;)"

Imagine if someone confessed to you they had flashed people in the past and could have gotten criminally charged for it. And then they would have ended with "well, i am not young and foolish these days ;)" it's flippant and minimizing. 

> and maybe it WAS a drunken mistake

And THIS is my problem. Qualifying it with drunken minimizes the sense if oersonal responsibility. There is no such thing as a drunk mistake. By getting drunk you sign your name to take responsibility of all your actions that you commit while drunk. If andrunk driver kills a person it's not drunken manslaughter it's manslaughter and if anything the drinking is an aggravating factor (you chose to reduce your self control and risked harming others).

So if it was an act done while drunk, it was an act, not a mistake. The mistake he did was to drink and to allow himself to abuse people. And since he sounds like an adult he should know better than that. The drunkedness makes it worse not better than a sober act.
