Narrow view is not what I would use to describe my comment, I made that comment based off past experiences with relationships lending me the perspective to say such a thing. But that said, you're right. All relationships are different and I would never dispute that.

But I would challenge you to make a case how someone can be "happy" in a 0/100 relationship as they talk about how hurt they are with what their SO is saying and doing. OP clearly ain't happy!

I think you're spot on with a relationship works with the amount of give and take that is equal to what both parties want. However, the men who want these 0/100 or 30/70 relationships are usually men with *control issues* which most certainly leads to problems down the line.
