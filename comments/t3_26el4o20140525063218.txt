I wondered the same thing as /u/Abornleader. Then I googled it. 

I was aware of the "Pick-Up Artists" bullshit, but I--apparently falsely--thought it was just a joke, that anyone would see it for what it is, a marketing scheme. And one that preys on the gullibility of its subjects, which are men. I didn't realize there was a subgroup of men who blame their own gullibility for the advertising on it's subjects, women. 

It's really terribly sad that there are human beings who don't understand that other human beings are just that--human beings. It's also sad that they are so desperate for human contact they fall prey to manipulation and fail to see the basic flaw in the premise.

The flaw, of course, is that other human beings won't see the 'manipulations' coming. We're a highly evolved social species, and that means we all, male and female, have a bullshit detector built in.

If the guys who frequent those sites spent less time with each other, stopped viewing other human beings as objects to be manipulated, spent more time in the company of, well, women, and started having actual conversations with them as peers, they'd have much more success at developing relationships and having sex.
