That subreddit makes me sad. Some of those women seem to be in straight up abusive situations but the red pill philosophy had convinced them its the way things are supposed to be. I try to be open minded, Ive got a lot of friends in the bdsm community who are lifestylers but I question how informed consent really is in a red pill relationship because its not fantasy, there are no safewords, no rules to protect the submissive party.
