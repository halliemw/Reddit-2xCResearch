I'm confused as to why someone (in this case a man) would want to feel "powerful" in the relationship in the first place.  How can a person experience a sense of less power (or...powerlessness) unless they felt they should have power over the other person to begin with?  We *are* powerless (always) about others think and feel about us, we depend on grace and love to build relationships, not power.

Anyone can walk away from anyone else at any time.  (This is why I have such a hard time with the institution of marriage - while I truly believe my partner and I are in it for the long run, I also understand that it's not because either of us has power over the other, nor do our circumstances control us).

We are in it because we want to be, and if one of us doesn't want to, it's over.  

(I'm assuming the "powerlessness" mentioned in the article is the writer's own internal sense of things - and look at how many different classes of 'objects' he can feel powerless in regard to...I'd avoid this man like the plague; would not want him as a parent, lover or close family member).  Girlfriend was great to figure this out after 4 months (I was in a relationship with this dynamic for far longer than that and what a mess the break-up was).
