Sure I don't *want* to be a burden, but who ever does?  But not asking for support just to avoid being a burden would seriously hurt me financially.  Anyway, the reason I asked about legal obligation was because I wanted to be fully educated on each of our rights before I presented the idea of him helping me.  Since we've basically been spending the past 2 months waiting to see if I could get financial aid, we hadn't really discussed what would happen if I ended up having to pay.

Anyway, we just talked about it and he agrees with me and thinks it's ridiculous that men don't have any legal obligation- provided that paternity is either proved or accepted.  But you're right, if I were with someone who was resistant to help me while bankrupting myself, I would seriously have to reconsider our relationship.

Thanks for your input!
