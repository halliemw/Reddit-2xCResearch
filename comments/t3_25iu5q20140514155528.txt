I'm 5'10 and all my height is in my legs. That finger tip rule be damned! If I wore shorts in high school, I would get stopped. Every. Damn. Time. It certainly was satisfying to see the look on the teachers face when I put my arms down to show that, not only were my shorts longer than my finger tips, they were longer by a couple inches. Some people don't care, it "looks" indecent, doesn't mean that it is indecent.
