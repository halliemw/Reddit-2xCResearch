I have no problem with women who want to go around topless. I think it should be legal. I'll help fight to make it legal. I just don't, personally, want to do it.

Since these are my personal breasts that we're talking about, I don't think it's anyone's place to tell me whether or not I should cover them. 

That's my point: there's overall standards of society, and then there are the individual, personal choices that people make. I certainly think it should be legal for everyone to wear or not wear a hijab (or, for that matter, a shirt) as they choose.

I also think that attacking women for their choices of clothing -- choices they are making about what parts of their own, personal bodies they want to cover with clothes -- is out of line.
