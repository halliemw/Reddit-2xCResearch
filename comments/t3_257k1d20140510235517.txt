My advice? Always use it for four weeks. My gyno pointed that out to me. You leave it in for four if you want to skip your period, so even if you aren't, just leave it in for four anyways, and then have fewer periods per year and use fewer rings. The three-week thing is just the attempt to make it seem more "natural cycle" stuff; they have four weeks' hormones in them.
