I have a dysfunctional family with a mum who has a crap husband, I used to try and get involved all the time because he treats her like crap in the end I finaly stopped gettong involved because they are going to do what they are going to do and blame was being put on me because I was so involved, so now I just leave them to it. 

At least your mum recognises what a douche this guy is, hopefully she will leave him to rot.
