I'm glad you were able to overcome your past. I grew up in a very sex-negative household, and went off to college last year. My views on sex have done a total 180 the last few months. I no longer see it as evil and unnecessary, only to be done in marriage, never to be enjoyed, only for procreation. I know better now. I'm glad you were able to enjoy yourself!
