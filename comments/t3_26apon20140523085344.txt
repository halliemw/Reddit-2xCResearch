wow I'm so sorry that you will have to go though all of that - it sounds like your doctors think you will come out the other side of this healthy and happy :)


I had the gardisil vaccine  - finished the last one a few weeks ago. IDK how effective it is but I haven't had as many sexual partners as most people my age (due to depression and other life circumstances etc)
