Why not intelligently argue your position in the form of posts or comments, or message the mods about it? I feel like this is a bit of an overreaction to such a change. Yes, new people will be coming into this sub and reading about women's issues, but that doesn't mean they will all be misogynistic trolls. Why not give the change a chance first before resorting to scare tactics?
