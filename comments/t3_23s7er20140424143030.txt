She dove in chest down with her arms and legs close to her centre of mass, her attempt to correct this while on top of the crowd is why she started to flip upside down.  She should of had her arms and legs "starfished" out and chest to the sky to maintain any sort of balance.

Crowdsurfing chest down isn't a good idea for anyone and doing so in a dress isn't the best choice either - especially on top of fans who are by definition fanatical about her.
