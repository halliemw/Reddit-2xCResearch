Where the heck did I say it increased? Oh wait, I didn't. Just because it doesn't change, doesn't mean others are entitled to use it freely whilst telling them it's none of their business. 

She can grow up and tell them/ask them about using it, realize they'll ask if she says nothing and be willing to tell them,  or pay for it herself/get it free at a clinic.
