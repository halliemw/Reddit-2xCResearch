I had the symptoms of PMDD and treated it with birth control (Yaz) for a while and it helped but then found that I had better results with a general anti-depressant (citalopram).  I've been on citalopram for about 5 months now and things have improved dramatically.

Because you are having suicidal thoughts and mentioned other issues ( like not really being comfortable as a woman in the first place and unhappiness at work), I would definitely speak to a professional sooner rather than later.  I was hesitant to talk to my doctor for a long time, but as soon as I did, things got much much better.

Also, please visit /r/suicidewatch if you need someone to talk to immediately.
