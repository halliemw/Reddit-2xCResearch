My mom is so capable with yard work that I always feel like a feeble worm by comparison. I'm not strong enough to get the weed-whacker going on my own without punching myself in the face. 

She comes in with big huge scratches on her arm and is all "Oh I guess I got too close to the tree" and I'm all "Eeeee there's a bee in the grass! I guess I'll finish mowing tomorrow" =.=
