I  have a skyla iud.  It's a  smaller  version  of mirena.
 Insertion was easy,  I'm  not  losing my mind on it like I did on depo,  and  my  body  is  responding well. 
I  cramp  more,  which  sucks but I've heard that it goes away after time. 
 Honestly, I  love  mine and I  sing it's praises whenever I can. I  almost didn't  get mine  because of all the  horror  stories  online  but everyone's body is different.  Ask  your dr  to  use an aerosol local  and a  cervical  block.
