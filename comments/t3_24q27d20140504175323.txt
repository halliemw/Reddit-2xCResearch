Good point, and one that seems to keep coming up in this thread! I should mention though that G and I do not fight often and we connect on almost every aspect of our lives aside from the friends thing. It's so hard to see that we might be incompatible for that reason, don't most couples have one thing they disagree on? I'm not advocating his actions, I'm just curious, you and all the other ladies here have brought up many good things to bring to G's attention! Thank you so much!
