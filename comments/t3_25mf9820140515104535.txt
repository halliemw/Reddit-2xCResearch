22, very girly (in dresses, heels, and makeup whenever I can) and no piercings. Needles terrify me and my older sister had some horrifying experiences with getting hers pierced, so I'm happy without them. When I first met my SO he was surprised that I lacked ear piercings because he likes them on women, but it's hardly a dealbreaker. Plus, I have super sensitive ears that are perfect for sex ;)
