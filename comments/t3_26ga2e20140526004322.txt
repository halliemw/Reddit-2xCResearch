Thank you so much. I'm a guy, and I'm tired of this stupid idea that so many guys have. It perpetrates this annoying idea of "alpha males" that deserve to get all the women and whatnot, an idea that had made me feel bad about myself for a long time due to my shyness. I hate this stupid misogynistic idea about masculinity that they try to pass off with pseudo-biological bullcrap.
