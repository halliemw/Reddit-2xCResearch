She has no idea what she is talking about. I'm studying psychology, and this in not what we learn about handling domestic violence. One of my friend did an internship, her advisor was a psychotherapist (psychoanalysis) who ACTUALLY claimed that rape victims are always to blame as much as their aggressors. She is fired by now, but rather because she was generally speaking a total asshole who wouldn't get along with the doctors.

Long story short, some psychologists are incompetent idiots. I'm so sorry you had to go through this and I hope you will find a more sensitive and professional counsellor :)
