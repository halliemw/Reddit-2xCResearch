Just to be clear, in most states (31 of 50), the age of consent is 16. It's only 18 in twelve states: Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. There is of course variation on certain relationships (ex., teacher-student), and other complicating factors.
