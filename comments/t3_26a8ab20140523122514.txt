Philosophically then a bar shouldn't serve drunk people since they're stealing from them? Hardly seems a good business model. Does that mean I can't consent when I'm depressed, stressed or in any way impaired? What happens if both the guy and I are drunk? Nether can consent...and yet neither are responsible - right?
