Having always lived in the North, "sir/ma'am" has not been part of my vernacular. However, I understand that it's simply a sign of respect in other areas of the country, and would never get "offended" by someone using it. I think the women at the dress fitting just had their offensensitivity hats on. I would have just rolled my eyes if I were you.

I used to laugh when I worked at a deli in Philly - I was 19 and worked along side a woman who must have been in her 70's, one of us would make the sandwich and the other would ring the customer up. People would constantly call her "miss" and me "ma'am". We used to get a good laugh over that!
