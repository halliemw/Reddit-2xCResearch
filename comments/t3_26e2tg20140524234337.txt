I immediately thought of [George Sodini](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Collier_Township_shooting), who went on a shooting spree in a women's aerobics class because he hadn't had sex in 20 years and he felt all women rejected him. Like Rogers, Sodini had tried PUA, hiring coaches to help him and going to seminars. He really hated women and thought of them as evil sluts who put out for everyone but him. This was five years ago.
