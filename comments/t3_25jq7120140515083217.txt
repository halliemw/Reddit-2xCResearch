I think there are two aspects to feminism: female empowerment, and gender equality. To start with, females needed a whole lot of empowerment to even hope for equality. That's what feminism gave them. Now that they're more empowered, I feel like it's time to focus on gender equality, and to do that, you need a movement that approaches balance from all sides of the equation, not just one, as feminism does.
