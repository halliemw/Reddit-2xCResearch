I think you're halfway there already just by having such clarity as to both the source of your concerns and your awareness that there are loads of great people (women included) out there. 

Maybe talk to someone? Or perhaps someone here has some good book recommendations. Not my area of experience (although now you mention it, a very similar incident might indicate a reason for my own isolation, so thanks).
