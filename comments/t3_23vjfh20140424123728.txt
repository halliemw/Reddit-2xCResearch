Can I ask a question? Is that you specifically need that KIND of birth control or is it that you need specifically Seasonique and not the generic?

Two things: The generic of Seasonique (apparently) does the same thing for your endometriosis. If your doctor does not believe that to be the case, they will need to write your insurance a letter of medical necessity for them to specifically cover Seasonique for your birth control instead of the generic.

If that is not the case but you simply prefer Seasonique to the generic (but your doctor would be fine with you taking the generic too), then unfortunately you will not find ANY insurance that will cover the brand-name for free. Switching insurance won't help here, because they are not legally required to cover it if there is a generic alternative unless your doctor specifically states it as necessary. (Typically, doctors will not write these as the generic active ingredient will function the same unless there is an outlying issue - for example, if you were allergic to gluten and the generic version used gluten as a filler, they might write a letter to your insurance for the brand name).

Hope that helps a bit.
