Okay, obviously the stuff that guy said in the interview was inexcusable and shitty.  Not professional and clearly misguided.

But... I could hardly focus on that because of how entitled and, for lack of a gentler word, pathetic the author comes across.  Her breakdown of what an informal interview is... I assume some of her commentary is facetious, but seriously?  And she actually calls job-hunting announcing to a room "Does anyone know anyone who's good at their job?"  She goes to a tiny hardcore Christian school, gets a very non-lucrative degree, spends and entire year rent-free working out of her field not even job-seraching, and finally after someone hands her a pity favor she begrudgingly goes to meet with this professional...

And then spends the entire time mocking the office, the professionals who work there, and assuming a shitload of sexist things about the companies before her interviewer even opens his mouth.

And to top it all off, she ends the article writing about how she quit THREE jobs in a row and can proudly say she now has "little to no professional contact with men".  Girl, I think the fact that you have been surviving for years on other people's pity and playing the entitled victim through all of it speaks a lot more of your capabilities than the fact that you got yourself your own diet coke.
