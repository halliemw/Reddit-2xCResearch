I occasionally lurked /r/TwoXChromosomes for a while now. I was surprised today when I realized it's now become a default sub. And not necessarily in a good way. I think the mods and admins looked at becoming default as something positive. And while there will be an influx of interested and thoughtful people who are more aware of this sub now, there will be a huge invasion of people who honestly don't belong here. Because therein lies the whole point that the admins of reddit and the mods of /r/TwoXChromosomes missed & are ignoring. This is supposed to be a safe community for open and honest discussions of all things pertaining to women. I'm not saying having men here will diminish that, I'm saying that taking this smaller sub and putting it daily in every reddit user's feed will irreversibly change the way rules are followed/made and discussions take place. They have taken a community and made it into some agenda-ed voyeuristic statement. Of all my years on reddit, I have never once felt that /r/TwoXChromosomes  was intended to be seen by all. It was a community people subscribed to out of personal decision. It felt like a close group, even toward strangers. Not so much any more.
