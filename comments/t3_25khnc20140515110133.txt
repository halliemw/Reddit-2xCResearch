As a female software engineer, I love this kind of news. I just wish the percentage was higher :( I have definitely had my fair share of sexism in the past 15 years though. My early career was quite rough (e.g. being told girls can't program or that I'm not a "real" programmer). I don't think it's indicative of all companies though. I think that something was fundamentally wrong with the company culture at that time.
