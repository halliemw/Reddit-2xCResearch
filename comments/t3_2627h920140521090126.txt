One thing that girls aren't really told is that THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SAY NO. whether it's a boy asking them to dance at the school dance, or a teacher asking them to stay late without a good reason- teach her that she doesn't have to do something she's uncomfortable with, and to talk to you or another trusted adult about these situations. Tell her that you're always on her side, and she should never be embarrassed to tell you something.
