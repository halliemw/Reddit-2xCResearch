I'm not implying that they choose dumb women, but there are different kinds of people. Some think that having kids is more important than a career, and for men having the luck to meet someone that wants to have kids with them is not something they will pass up. The best thing a man can do to ensure that he has the opportunity to have kids is to be established with a good career that can support a family.
