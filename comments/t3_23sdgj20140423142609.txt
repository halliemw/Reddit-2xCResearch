I play video games, which I think stands for itself. This is why I never do any sort of online-gaming (with the exception of literally one game). In high school, I talked with a few guys who played video games, and they were actually pretty good about not being jerks; I never felt like I was being talked-down to. However, when I was living in a dorm in college, I mentioned that I was considering being a video game designer to a few guys.

One of them said, "Oh... really... what kind of games do you play then?" My standard answer to this is, "Well, I play a lot of genres! I don't really have a favorite," which is true. I mean, how can you answer such a broad question? He asked, "Do you like first-person shooters?" I said, "No. I like third-person shooters and shoot-em-ups, though!" which is also true since I get heavily motion-sick when playing first-person games. He then asked, "Do you like sports games?" I said, "No," because I find them boring. He then gave me a condescending smirk and said, "Well, what other games are there then? Clearly you don't like any games."

Apparently *all* games are now either a FPS or sports game. Nothing else exists. No Mario. No World of Warcraft. No Tetris. No Final Fantasy. No Street Fighter. No Pac-Man. Nothing.
