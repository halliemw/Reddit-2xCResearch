I was never telling anyone to shut up, as i said, there's a different between sharing an opinion and freaking out. agree to disagree. that's fine. It's just the whole 'i dont agree with you, therefore i will downvote you' turning this place into one big circle jerk. It's just frustrating, and someone in reddit that just seems to constantly happen.

> Calm down. This will all work itself out. It's just the internet. 

I don't think im the person you need to be saying this to. I highly doubt i'm the problem here. i reckon i am quite alone in this.
