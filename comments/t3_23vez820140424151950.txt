Naw you can't hard STEM it but at least sociology does studies to get some hard data on it.  And sociology is a science, yeah?  Which means they're part of the "S" in STEM, and if there are studies and statistics, those too are part of the "S."  I'll say as a physics major, there is a theory of gravity, it's just the "why" that scientists aren't so sure on, and yes they are studying why it works, but it's a bit less important than the soft sciences because people are trying to change society.  No one's trying to change gravity.
