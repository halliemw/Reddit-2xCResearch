Don't expect anyone, anymore, to "refer" victims anywhere.  It's sad that the most educated women aren't aware that...they need to go immediately to law enforcement.

At my college, law enforcement acts like LE, and immediately contacts City/Sheriff entities, depending on exactly where the crime was committed, for investigation.  But that's not necessarily typical.

The more a college wants to appear "crime-free" the more they avoid actually turning things over to LE.  At every level.
