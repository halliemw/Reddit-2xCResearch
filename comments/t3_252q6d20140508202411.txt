Well, the answers hear-felt though they may be, are unsatisfying. I'm asking direct questions and getting generic responses that you haven't sought feedback because of brigading, or you're doing what you feel is best. I'm also not getting any sense of a plan on how to engage the community in this decisions, that is again getting dismissed based on issues of brigading or biased votes.

It basically all translates as political double-speak - a reassuring invitation to trust the mod team, when I have said that, specifically, is the problem.
