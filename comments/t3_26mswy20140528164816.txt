I wish I had gold to give you. This whole tragedy has been doubly sad because it has devolved into yet another gender war, when the truth is everyone is just frustrated, scared and confused and we all have completely fucked up ideas about how relationships work. It's heartbreaking because, as you said, we are so close to understanding each other but we can't get over the damn cultural indoctrination.
