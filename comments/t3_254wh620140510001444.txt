Oh, so (and excuse my ignorance here, again, new to the sub due to it's default status) this sub is supposed to be a echo chamber? *edit* And as for taking it somewhere else, where might you suggest one go to see these sorts of conversations? It's unfortunate, but most subs that are dealing with these issues tend to be very hostile to questions and think ignorance=hate when actually ignorance just means you don't know something. And that is what I meant by these "challenges" here in the sub. People coming with questions in regards to things they don't know and getting educated. Also, this could be totally off base here, but I am sensing a little... anger, annoyance, general dismissiveness in your posts in this thread, and I doubt that is helpful to new members trying to gain a wider perspective. Snarkyness is met with a wall of deafness, anything said will not be heard.
