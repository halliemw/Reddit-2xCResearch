it doesn't excuse what he did. but did enable what he did. he was armed with distance, and he was able to use that distance as a weapon against you. you would be better served to not be in a relationship with someone who has that type of weapon, because then they won't be able to use it against you. many people are selfish and inconsiderate. distance makes it harder for you to identify those types of people. so when you have a long distance relationship, you don't know if you are in it with a good person, or a wolf in sheep's clothing. 

it would be in your own best interest to not take that chance.
