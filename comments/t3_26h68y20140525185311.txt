Well, at least you tried. Making pointed statements and asking blunt questions is much easier said than done. Some people just need to learn lessons for themselves before they'll really take it all to heart. It seems unlikely that this relationship will last, and perhaps your words will mean more to her during the emotional fallout that will inevitably come with its ending. I know how frustrating this kind of thing can be, and you're being a good friend by sticking with her even though she's being a bit ridiculous. I wish I could offer better advice, but try to take solace in the fact that you're a good person for caring.
