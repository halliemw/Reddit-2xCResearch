That's how some guys joke around with their friends, however I don't know the details of the other instances of disrespect. This sounds like one of his buddies asked what he was up to, and he gave the response "I'm with my girlfriends and her friends, save me!" It's not an attack on you, it's a preemptive strategy to not get clowned by his friends. 

Depending on the type of friends that he has, there are a few different responses to "I'm hanging out with my girlfriend and her friends." One is along the lines of "That's cool," the other is "getting your toenails painted huh?" In order to avoid the latter response, he adds "save me." 

He may have been enjoying himself, but tells his friends otherwise to avoid ridicule. This particular instance shouldn't be taken personally.
