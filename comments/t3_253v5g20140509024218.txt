Ugh I'm sorry, that sounds awful. I have no clue what to tell you other than to take either a benadryl or an anti-inflammatory like ibuprofin, wrap some ice in a towel or soak in the tub, and then see a doctor ASAP. It sounds like it could be severe dryness or dermatitis as a reaction to your treatments.

Also, will you update and let us know what happens? I care for your own sake and I'm also super curious about what could be causing this since I've never heard of it before. I'm also a little freaked because I've been having similar symptoms like a yeast infection and self-treated even though I didn't test positive for it last time (my doctor said it was okay though because we couldn't figure out what else was wrong and maybe the test was incorrect?). Why do our vaginas have to be so damn fickle and tricky!?!?!

I hope you find some relief and are okay!
