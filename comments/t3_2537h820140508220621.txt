Not all women want the same representatives. Some women reps will have different views just like female voters have different views. Doesn't mean they shouldn't represent a huge part of the population to a higher degree, IMO. Did you enjoy hearing all the men discuss rape, abortion, and birth control like they owned a vagina? I'd rather hear women talk about my issues. But yes, all politicians are bought these days, and our votes are worth nada to the billionaires and CEOs. It's kinda silly.
