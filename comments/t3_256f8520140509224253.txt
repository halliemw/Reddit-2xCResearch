This isn't exactly classic literature, but the ladies in my family have all bonded over a great book, The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood. It was a must-read when I came of age.

More modern but still very interesting is the Wool series by Hugh Howely. It is set in a sort of dystopian future like Hunger Games with a strong female lead. He also has a series, Molly Fyde which is also really good! Check his work out on amazon!

My nieces are both nearing graduation but I have a tradition I started a few years ago.  They come to visit for a few weeks in the summer or I come and get them and we take a trip. We stop at a bookstore at our destination and we look around until we agree on a book. Then we sit around on the beach in coffee shops, at our resort- wherever- and read. Always, talking about the book sparks more conversation about unrelated topics and we just let it take us where it takes us. I have built strong relationships with them this way! My oldest niece is going to be 25, and this year we are going to France for two weeks of girl fun. I already have two copies of A Year in Provence and two copies of A Walk Across France just waiting.

Good luck and please update or PM what you choose!
