Thank you for the clarification john. I have received 100+ combined down votes so far and that's great for my productivity because that will keep me off reddit for awhile.

Now i would really appreciate if you could explain how my thesis is flawed and horrid. In case I was being unclear, I'm not really addressing OP's being groped/touched, but rather goatismycopilot's comment suggesting that OP could wear whatever she wants. This advice is incredibly short-sighted and impractical in my opinion.
