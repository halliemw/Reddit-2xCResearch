I was bullied because school came easily to me, it was a jealousy thing that just turned into a 'because I'm there' reason. I did not say *every* case of bullying is jealousy related, I said this one probably is. Maybe they're bullying her because she is pretty and she's got an acting thing going on. In this specific case I can totally see it being jealousy. Just because it's also a power thing doesn't stop it from also being jealousy.
