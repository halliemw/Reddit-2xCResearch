That's terrible :( I'm realizing the same things about my university more and more as graduation nears (already getting emails to an institution to which I'm financially indebted to for 'senior class gift' donations?!) I try to focused on my personal growth, liberation, and learning I've done in the past four years and how proud my family is of me and my accomplishments here. Congratulations on your degree and I hope you're able to celebrate with your family rain or shine!
