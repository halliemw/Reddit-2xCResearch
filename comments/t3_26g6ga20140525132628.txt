Asshole dudes who don't want to even try don't *need* an excuse to get off and fall asleep... and if they're that shitty a partner, don't be with them! Easy enough. 

Meanwhile, dudes who think that the woman *must* come *every time* regardless of the woman in particular... really fucking suck for women who can't reliably orgasm. And it's not a problem that can just be chalked up to assholes being assholes, because it is really born of good intentions, so "stop seeing them" isn't necessarily a good fix. They could be a great dude otherwise. 

It's not misinformation, it's just wrong for *you*, which is solved by *talking to your sexual partners*. For me, it's totally true. I absolutely cannot and will not come every time, nor do I need to or even desperately want to (it would be NICE, but... eh). I have had sex utterly ruined before by men who would not accept that as the final word. And I still love the fuck out of sex either way. The idea that there are women who are happy to have sex without orgasming may be wrong for you, but it's right for me. It's not misinformation.
