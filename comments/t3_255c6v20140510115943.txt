I don't see it as QuestionableQuery wanting to defend weak women. That would involve a level of patronization that I don't see at all in his posts. I think he's just trying to help protect the quality of 2X and is genuinely asking how. He can do the same things that we women are doing - sustaining mature, supportive discussions and reporting trolls.
