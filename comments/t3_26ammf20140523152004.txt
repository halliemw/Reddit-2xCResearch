It's a very complex and gray area. It has a lot to do with the man's ability to self-regulate, but I don't think that it's really all that important. 

I think we should be rarely concerned with criminal liability; I'm looking for what's best for the parties involved. If this man needs more treatment and more supervision it'll be good for him and for other students at the college. If the institution isn't going to do what is necessary then criminal proceedings will hopefully mandate the care that he needs.
