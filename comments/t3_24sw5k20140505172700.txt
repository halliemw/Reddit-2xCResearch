I am trying. (I'm eating red wine cake right now :) ) It is really disorienting. Much more than I anticipated. But just knowing that while i'm sitting here waiting for him to curl up next to me or tell me he loves me he is out with another girl. He is forgetting everything of the last 7 years because it is easier to just jump in to something else- something that he doesn't have to feel guilty about. That at least puts things into perspective. I was the good. And maybe this girl can be good too but something makes me think she is just as morally bankrupt as him because she did the exact same thing to her long term boyfriend.
