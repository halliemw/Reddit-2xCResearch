Well, they actually posted a video today of a woman being arrested by the Morality Police. It is horrific. I don't know what the penalty is for the "crime" of showing one's hair in public. 

You might also have seen in the news about the young women without hijab in the "Happy" video? Those three and the four young men involved were all arrested. All but the director of the video have since been released.
