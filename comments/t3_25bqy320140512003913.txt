> I want to know if you ever feel threatened or in danger when walking outside.

Not exactly threatened but very definitely harassed when I was younger. When I was 18 I'd walk home from high school which took about an hour.

People would honk and scream all kinds of nonsense at me as they drove by. "**BALLS, BITCH!!! HAHAHAHA**" is one that stands out in my memory.

Once someone was hiding in some hedges and giggling at me. You can't make this shit up, I mean what the fuck.

I guess I was young and baby faced so I made a tempting target to try and annoy to death.

10 years later I'm bigger and I have a big beard which I'm told makes me somewhat scary looking. A male coworker was telling me what a great guy I was and he didn't know why one of our female coworkers wasn't all over me. Then he paused for a moment and told me the beard was a bit much, though. He said "you look like you could murder someone and then just go eat dinner."

Aside from people just not being aggressive towards me anymore I think I have noticed fear in an instance or two. I was restless a while ago so I decided to go for a walk at three in the morning. A car came to an intersection just as I walked up to it also and instead of stopping at the stop sign they blew right through it. Presumably they didn't want big-scary-beard-man near their car in the dead of night.

I think I prefer it this way. People like me a lot once they get to know me and having people steer clear in public is preferable to "**BALLS, BITCH!!! HAHAHAHA**"

It's probably worth noting that I mostly stick to the suburbs and various other safe areas. I don't venture into urban centers all that often so maybe it would be different if I did.
