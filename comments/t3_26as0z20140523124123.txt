Agreed. Additionally, it's typically okay to delay doing a lot of that house and vehicle maintenance work. Dinner has to be cooked *today*, the produce goes bad after a week, there's only enough clean laundry to last 2 weeks at most. Shit hits the fan if the interior maintenance doesn't get done whereas the lawn growing too tall or the house losing some heat isn't an immediate priority. That flexibility makes a big difference both in stress and allowances for other (perhaps paid) activities.
