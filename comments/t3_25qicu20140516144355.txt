There have always been guys here. Every so often one will come out of lurking and comment "as a guy, I'm genuinely curious..." or post something to help or gain better understanding of a situation regarding a lady in his life. And it's awesome.

We're not a community of women; we're a very mismatched group covering every gender identity, sexual orientation, age, location, and background, all interested in women's issues, experiences, and frustrations. At least that's how I view this sub. Look at our front page: we cover family issues, successes, cute critters, advice, and meta posts about whether or not becoming a default was a good idea.

Going default definitely has its drawbacks. What no one's mentioned is how many *women* have now noticed this sub. Men are becoming more prevalent. And like any good sub, we have trolls. We don't need the guys to fend off these trolls; we just need to downvote and ignore. Don't feed them, don't engage, just report to the mods. And if the mods want the publicity that comes with being a default, they need to step it up and keep this a safe, respectful community redditors can turn to for women-centric talk.
