For my senior prom, I wore the same dress my mom wore to her junior prom (which, coincidentally was made for her by her mother).  The style was a bit outdated, and my shoulders are wider than hers from swimming, so the top part was removed and recreated by a family friend, but I looked great!  http://imgur.com/R99LIYn.jpg
