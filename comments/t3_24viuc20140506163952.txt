Your skin doesn't need exfoliation. It strips away the protective layers, leaving you more vulnerable if you have a contact allergy.  
  
Learned that from my doc after I begged her for more information on what I could do to stop my Nickel allergy from being so bad. No soap, no scrubbing, and only gentle drying with a towel. My skin's never been better.
