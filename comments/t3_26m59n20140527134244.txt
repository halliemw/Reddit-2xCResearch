To that end, I would really suggest finding a place that isn't your house to meet, and offering up some token gift like coffee. Whenever we have housemate meetings at my place, I feed them dinner. Should I have to? No. Am I trying to make them feel guilty? No. I'm trying to make this feel more like a business relationship, and there is a reason business meetings frequently happen over food. 

Also, before you talk to your housemate, take some time to clarify what you want, what is acceptable, and what your deal-breaker is. That way you cannot be taken for a ride on your emotions; you already know what calm-you wants, and you can navigate from there. 

Even if this all blows up in your face and your housemate accuses you of being a heartless, jealous shrew, she's clearly in the wrong here. Trufax, even if you do everything right, there's no guarantee of a great outcome where people and strong feels are involved. <3
