Talk to someone (HR, a supervisor) at your job about sexual harassment. If it happened to you, he's probably coming in and saying stuff like that to other workers. Ask them what their policy is to deal with it the next time (Can you alert a supervisor? Tell the aggressor you're going to call the police?).
