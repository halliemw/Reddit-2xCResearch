What a rubbish situation to be in. Seems like it was made much worse by the very unpleasant nurse and tech. Can't believe she asked you that and didn't even close the door.  

I once went through a slightly similar situation and 3.5yrs later I still feel embarrassed about it. I had given birth only 5 hours earlier and since my newborn was sleeping I managed to fall asleep too. I was deeply asleep (since I had been awake for almost 3 days in labour) and I didn't realise just how heavy post-partum bleeding could be so I ended up leaking through my pad, my pajamas, the chux pads, the bed sheets etc. The blood was everywhere but since it was 2am and the lights were off I didn't realise, I thought I had only leaked a little bit. So I was trying to walk to the bathroom, which was at the end of a very long hallway, half asleep and in complete agony, when a nurse just started *screaming* at me because of the blood. She told me I was a "disgusting, dirty girl" and wouldn't let me have a shower to clean up, I had to use TP only (and wiping a swollen, bruised and stitched up vag and perineum with TP is awful).  

A horrid situation made much worse by a crappy nurse.
