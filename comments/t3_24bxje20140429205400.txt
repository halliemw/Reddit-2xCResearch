I've never taken Plan B but if you search this subreddit, plenty of women have already posted about their experiences taking it. Symptoms vary because they depend on the woman and her body chemistry. You may experience some nausea and a weird menstrual cycle instead of your typical period (it could come early or be delayed depending on what the hormones from Plan B do in your body). The product itself should also list common side effects and any serious side effects that you should see a doctor for.
