Late to the party, but for anybody looking to try a new birth control who is fascinated by these... whatever-they're-calleds, try Orsythia. For whatever reason, it gave me HUGE ones. One time I pulled one out that was about the size of a ping-pong ball. Being a bio major, I was fascinated of course, so I took it to the sink and rinsed it off while unraveling it gently. It was this thin and stained, but was probably once white, "skinlike" layer that spanned the width of my hand. Best experience ever.
