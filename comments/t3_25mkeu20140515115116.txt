Great suggestion. I used to just wrap in tp and put in the trash, but one time I was staying with some male roommates parents and their dog pulled it out of the trash and was eating it. Luckily I happened to be the next person in the bathroom so I cleaned it up. Embarrassment avoided! Until the toilet freaked out and overflowed. I got made fun of for having massive shits, even though I only peed. So the embarrassment was back on. Guy friends are great.
