You're pretty smart. I think you are going about this the right way for the most part. 

I am a 22 y/o male and tbh something like this would be essentially strike one for me. Yes it is serious, although most people understand how snapchat is used, my immediate thought would be that they had probably exchanged nsfw pictures. However, it appears as though he was truly remorseful so I wouldn't dwell on it for too long, an overreaction is potentially as dangerous to a relationship as the action that caused it. 

I'm sure you would appreciate total honesty in the future, so make sure that he doesn't regret being honest with you. 

>I must admit it was pretty satisfying watching a 6'2" semi-athletic manly man type break down and throw himself and his future at my mercy.

Although I understand the sentiment here, the way you describe it is borderline cringeworthy. You express satisfaction, not that the man you say you love is humbling himself to you-for you, but that a man that is, " 6'2" semi-athletic (and the) manly man type," could break down for you. Not only does that highlight some of your own insecurities, but also hints at controlling tendencies.

I hope you don't take this as negative feedback and more as a comment that may inspire you to consider your priorities.

I want to urge you to be *more* confident!  Nothing looks or sounds better on a woman.
