Yeah!  I mean, no one's bought any, but I sell them *in theory*.  I have a [society6 shop, and you can buy art prints and some other odds and ends](http://society6.com/ThriftShopHell/prints).  

I'm not really set up for selling the actual objects yetâ€”not *opposed* to it (I would really like some of them out of my house), I just haven't figured out a good way to do shipping.  But in the future, if there's enough interest, I'll probably set up an etsy shop with the objects themselves.  (Etsy allows "vintage" stuff, right?)
