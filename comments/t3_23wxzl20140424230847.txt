Sometimes the speculums are too large. I don't think it's normal for it to be painful. If the speculum isn't the right size, or the doctor just shoves it in like the OP's did after she expressed pain and was tense, of course it will. I don't think that the norm or that's how the exams should be. 

When I expressed pain during my exams or was tense the doctors stopped and ended the exam or waiting 'til I was more relaxed. They never just pushed through.
