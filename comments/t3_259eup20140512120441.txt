I had just moved to a new city and was completely broke and had - very literally - two friends at the time. I never went out or did a lot because I was either working, or didn't have the money. It seemed necessary to me to not lose either of them. I was embarrassingly desperate for company while in a bad place, so I very much wanted to believe - and did - that he got the point - since he said he did - and wouldn't ever try anything like that again. He invited me over because The Walking Dead was on, and we followed it. I didn't want to have sex with him. I wanted a friend, and to watch TV after work. So I'm not as loose with my morals as you think. Thanks though.
