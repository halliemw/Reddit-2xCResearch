The way I see it is that while it is the woman's body, and I do think that she has all the rights anyone should have over their body, there is also another "body" here that should maybe have rights too? I don't really know the best solution, I am just trying to get as much information as possible to make an educated choice. I think that if the child provides a health risk for the woman then that is a case that should be allowed. Thank you.
