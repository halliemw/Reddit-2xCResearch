It sounds like she has something very stressful going on in her life, and she's taking it out on you.  

This behavior is unusual, it's out of character for her, and she's acting very aggressively over small things (that have never been a problem before) and refusing solutions—something's up.

It's unfortunate that she's taking it out on you—you *definitely* didn't deserve all of that.  And it's unfortunate that she doesn't feel comfortable sharing what's wrong.

She's not acting like herself, so she might need extra support right now.  At the same time, you don't deserve to be treated this way.  

I think you have a choice (or a series of choices) to make about boundaries, and to what extent (if any) you're willing to put up with this kind of abuse until you learn what's going on.
