Jared, the tall awkward Pied Piper employee, seems to be the biz dev guy for their startup. The woman, Monica, is the assistant to the investor and it seems like he was letting her watch over the PP guys a bit to ensure that they were getting their shit done, but now that he's out of town (side note: sadly, the actor passed away, which I think is why they invented that plot about the island) she's able to come to the conference and devote a bit more time to helping them out directly.
