I have another test that I'll do in a week or so. I've considered going to get a blood test or something. I told my boyfriend (he'll be 20 in November), and he told me that I'm over exaggerating and I'm fine. But he still cared about how I was feeling and didn't just rudely brush it off.

Edit: why has my comment gotten downvoted?  Especially on a post I created. Sheesh.
