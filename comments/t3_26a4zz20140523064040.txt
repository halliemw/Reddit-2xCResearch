Ok so I just looked through that period clots thread to search for the apparently HUGE amount of people saying "get this shit off my Reddit" and I found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/252zar/favorite_name_for_endometrial_tissue_period_clots/chde8eg) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/252zar/favorite_name_for_endometrial_tissue_period_clots/chdh1xq) both heavily downvoted and they are pretty much the only comments of that sort I can find, whilst I also found [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/252zar/favorite_name_for_endometrial_tissue_period_clots/chdf8ve) which is upvoted and is pretty much the opposite of what you seem to think went on in that thread.
