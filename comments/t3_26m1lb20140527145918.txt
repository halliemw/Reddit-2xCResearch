Keep going, because we need more people to do the same. What you, and people like you, have done is not yet enough. If you're lucky, some day the people you've helped educate will have contributed to a society in which a woman won't be afraid to walk past you on the street. Until then, unfortunately, women will be clutching their keys, heartbeat at a high pitched whine, while walking at night around big men who could kill them.

I'm sorry that you have to suffer these hurtful things because of the evils of other men.
