They never used the word censor. What they are saying is that in the show murder is shown as terrible, wrong, and possessing long term punishments. However in the show one charecter commits a rape, and it is never brought up or talked about again. Hell forgive me for the SPOILERS, but the person he raped goes on to love him in the books.
