all of these things you're talking about, men producing more and "doing" more, is largely the result of women basically being treated as property for the majority of history. they did not have access to education or enjoy the same rights men did until very recently. of course men wrote more books, men were actually allowed to learn to read! what's your point? that doesn't make women less useful, and it doesn't mean our gender norms are a product of biology, but rather a reflection of culture. women are mothers and men are workers, because it's been that way for most of history so that must mean it's true? bullshit.
