I don't know that I can offer any real advice, but I can offer support. I think your opinions are completely valid, and she would be wise to pay attention to what you have to say.You're completely right, everyone should spend time alone (single) to find out who they are. You simply can't  have an ideal -- not (co)dependent -- relationship unless you're fully aware of yourself as a person. If you can't be happy with yourself, by yourself, you'll ultimately end up relying too strongly on the other person in the relationship.

It's ridiculous that in one relationship she hates baseball, and in the next she's not a real woman unless she loves it. I take strong issue with people who live out false lives on their Facebook pages, and that certainly seems to be what she's doing here. Or is she? Does she even know if she likes baseball? Sounds as if she likes it based on her SO's opinions involving women and baseball.

I wish I could tell you what to do, but I'm basically in your position when it comes to some of my own friendships. Hence, I can relate. I just try to point out, to these people, the obvious questions that arise in such situations. She's an adult, she has to have thought of these things, right? Perhaps her answers to a couple blunt questions will help you figure the situation out, or at least make her think. Moving away with this guy seems like an iffy action at best, I wouldn't consider a few serious questions from a close friend to be out of bounds here.

And yeah, I'm a guy, your post was on the 'Rising' page so I took a stab at an answer ;-)
