Maybe not a save the date, but definitely if she was invited to the shower. So many things can change from when the save the date is sent and the actual wedding. 

Edit: Hmm, so one of my most downvoted comments is about a save the date. Okay. I guess I was just trying to express the idea that the save the date comes so early that so many things can change from the time it's sent to the time the actual invitations go out, which is STILL 6-9 months before the event. I'm not defending OP's "friend" and I feel for OP, because what she's gone through is shitty. But playing devil's advocate, I can see how it's *possible* that one can receive a save the date and not end up getting an invite. I don't think it's fair, and should be discussed with the non-invitee, but shit happens and plans change. Sorry if my different perspective offended you.
