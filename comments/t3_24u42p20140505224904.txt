No way for us to know, but if you call your local office, they may be able to help.

In many areas, PP operates on a sliding scale, so services are typically low or no cost. In other areas, funding isn't robust enough to subsidize services, so the patients pay more. 

If PP can,t help, there's likely a different county health or family health clinic available. Furthermore, your school likely has a clinic as well, which you pay fees for every semester.
