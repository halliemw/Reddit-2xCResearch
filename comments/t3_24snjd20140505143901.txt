I'm sorry but I think you've been more than understanding and passive throughout this ordeal...it is time to get "active", not passive, about it before you end up hating him and yourself all at once...its not fair to either of you to go on like this. Like all the others have said you guys will need outside intervention or its not going to get any better. Tough times are common in a marriage but it sounds like you guys are already off to a rocky start. Good luck with everything and keep us posted.
