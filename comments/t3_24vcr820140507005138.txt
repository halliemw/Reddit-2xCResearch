That's how society views people in general, if you're taller you're more successful. Men who are 6"0-6"2 tend to have more career success and women tend to attracted to men who are in that height range. The shorter a man is the more he is taken less seriously and at certain height range you start to be invisible to women as they no longer even consider you as an option. I'm just saying that this isn't gender specific, it's just an unfortunate part of life. It hits both sexes unfairly.

I don't know, this thread is enlightening. As a man I know what men go through when it comes to their height. I personally am 5"11 (which is a tantalizing curse as it's so close to 6"0), but I know how important height is from a male perspective.

However, I never once considered that women go through anything similar. The average height for a woman in the U.S is 5"4. It sucks that those under that have to go through some of things described in this thread. I mean I've heard of women complaining about short girl problems (having to climb the kitchen counters to reach cupboard for instance) but never in any kind of serious "this actually really sucks" kind of way.
