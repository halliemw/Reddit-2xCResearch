I'm not OP, but I'm just curious about your difficult situation because it relates a little to problems I've had with my mother. Does it ever bother you still that your dad hit you when he knew you had no way out? How did you forgive him for that? Does the anger ever flare back up?

I can understand why a lot of users on this sub have a "cross the line once and you're out" mentality, but I'm also curious about how you came to terms with the situation in your own way. 

(BTW, if any of this is too personal, I understand; please don't feel obligated to answer if so.)
