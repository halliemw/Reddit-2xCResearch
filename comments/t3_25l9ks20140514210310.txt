I'm pretty sure she's just being selfish then. If she's really that bothered by it, then she obviously has some sort of either resentment towards being denied by your crush or still has feelings towards him. In either case, I would be careful of what she might do in the future if she doesn't get over it. In reality, what is more important to you? Is her friendship worth throwing away or is this relationship going to be worth more than that? As a guy, I don't forsee the guy being dumb about it, especially since you've been friends much longer with him than you have with her so I think you should go for it! If she was truly a girlfriend of yours, she would want you to be happy, especially since you're her friend too and she's dating someone that she's happy with as well.
