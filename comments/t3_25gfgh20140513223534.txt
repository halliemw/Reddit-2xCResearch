Some people think she is. I personally don't. Either way, her body type isn't up to the television standard for women, whereas Patrick Wilson is a very good looking man. People have (to a lesser extent, because her romantic interests aren't as classically handsome/because she isn't naked all the time in her show) given Mindy Kaling the same complaint, basically saying that she's not pretty enough of a character to have so many men interested in her.
