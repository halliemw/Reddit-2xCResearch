Well....this isn't exactly new. I was taught in 1974 about girl and boy bikes regarding the bar. Personally, I'd think a step through frame would make better sense for whacking balls on a guy, but that's me. How old is your father? When people grow up with certain standards or information, it can be hard for them to accept change or modernity. I'm sure it's not a whole 'gender-and-sexism-thing' in his mind. He thinks a girl's bike is for his daughter. I guess he'd think a boy bike would work for a son. Don't look too deep into it, I think its pretty straightforward. Besides...you got the bike you wanted, right?

Now if your father DEMANDED you paint it pink, with glitter and tassles on the handlebars and was uncompromising and forced it upon you...then you might have a case. Now, go ride your bike and get off the internet. Internet is for boys, anyway!
