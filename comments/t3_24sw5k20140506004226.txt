This is really similar to how my last relationship ended. It wasn't even close to 7 years though, so I can only imagine how much worse it must be for you. In my situation (2 years later I think?), my ex is still with the girl he had an inappropriate (probably full on cheating but I never got confirmation) relationship with. Obviously time heals the wound but I remind myself all the time what a bullet I dodged and how much these two scumbags deserve each other. The way I think about it is: this man was going to cheat sooner or later and I'm just grateful we didn't get married or have children before it happened. I'm also grateful I eventually found out about it (it had likely been going on for months before my breakup). 

In any event, I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
