>If a man gives up his career he loses his most valuable asset in the pursuit of progeny, if a woman gives up her career she still has the choice to have a child.

If a man is at the point of considering moving cities for a relationship, then it's safe to say his earning potential isn't as important to her as his company. Plus, I don't know that earning potential is the number one attractive thing in a man. 

It's not like by moving cities the man has to give up his career forever. There will be jobs in the new city. 

Obviously it should depend on the couple and the individuals, but it's not necessarily a simple decision and there's no reason for OP to give up her career in this case.
