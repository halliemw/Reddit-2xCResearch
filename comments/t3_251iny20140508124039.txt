I appreciate that. I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted; I fully believe it's more than simply talking to a female but I really was having trouble getting that from your post. Sometimes when we are really emotionally involved in a situation we forget to explain what we think are REALLY OBVIOUS THINGS. It happens to me all the time. I just figured that was what happened here and I was missing the point.
