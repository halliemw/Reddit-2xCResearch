I'm glad you did not make a throw away. You are right, you should not feel bad about saying no. I am proud of you for saying that, thank you. Like others have chimed in, I would just cut the tie. "It would be dishonest of me to pursue anything further. This just is not working out for me, but I wish you well in the future." was my standard line. I tried to make it sound like what was said to me when I got axed from jobs.

No matter what, do not get dragged into the "why" conversation. Frankly, it is nobody's business why. Its your decision, you've made it, you do not have to defend it.
