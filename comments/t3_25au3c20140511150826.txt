Just finding a list of everything that is on the market and what their highlights/claims are; the catalogued on one website. That would be awesome. I have considered the copper IUD based on what I have read about it so far, but not sure if there are other considerations because of my age/peri status. Honestly, would even consider just flat out getting my tubes tied, too. Not the littlest bit interested in having kids. Tried to get my GYN to take care of that 10 years ago and she wouldn't/thought I'd change my mind.
