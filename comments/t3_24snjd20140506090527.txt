Thank you so much. I brought up the idea of therapy to him last night, as well as the possibility that he's having a recurrence of his BP (or at least a more severe swing than usual) and while he wasn't gung-ho about therapy, it definitely got him thinking. I feel like we're moving toward the right direction now.
