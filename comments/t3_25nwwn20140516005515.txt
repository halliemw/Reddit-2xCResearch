Yeah, me too, but I only want to hear it from certain people.

Oh, the dance we play with intimacy/strangeness.  If someone ends up being on the "it's okay to talk about my weight" side of things, I have learned to regard that person as a potential intimate - I'm clearly closer to them in some way than the people who I want to shut up about it.

But I'm also aware that I am apparently inscrutable and I cannot blame others for not knowing what I do and don't consider a compliment.
