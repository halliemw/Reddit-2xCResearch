I'm arguing that there is no law against bullying to be created that can eliminate the majority of bullying without restricting legitimate criticism.  Hopefully I'm wrong, but I still would be highly skeptical that this ideal law would be the one that is written and passed.

Btw, great for you that you misunderstood my position about depression yet again. It is absurd to suggest that depression isn't likely to be a factor in suicide, and noticing such a correlation isn't a claim that "depression = suicide, and depressed people have no agency," a position your first comment falsely characterized me as endorsing.

As to your point about online harassment and courts, such cases can already be brought.  I seriously doubt that most online harassment would be punishable, and it certainly wouldn't be worth the defendants time in any borderline case.  I'd fully support it in such cases where it is morally supported, and where it will hopefully be legally well received, but expanding such laws could lead to more abuse than it prevents.  People have regularly attempted to use harassment laws against journalists, though thankfully these cases are generally judged properly. This is part of the reason why some people in the US will view laws against harassment as undue government intrusion on speech.
