There is a way to track IP addresses... I have no idea how as I'm not tech savy but it is possible.  He can't hide his computer location behind fake profiles.  The only issue I see is if he is using public wi-fi.  Maybe that helps??

I don't know much about restraining orders but do those include internet contact?  If you know who he is and they haven't given you one against him already for his past crimes to you maybe they will give you one now?
