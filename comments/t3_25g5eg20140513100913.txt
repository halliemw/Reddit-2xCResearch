I have one and it works for me, but it worked for me right from the beginning. I don't think it has had any effect on my weight, skin or mood, though none of those were ever great. I don't have periods at all. Before I got the implant I had the depo injection for a few years and I didn't have periods on that either. It sounds like it isn't the right form of birth control for you.
