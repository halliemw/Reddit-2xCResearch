It's ok to miss him and to hurt and to grieve for the relationship you thought it was. It's ok to be hurt by the way he's treated you, which was terrible. But you also need to recognize is that his actions reflect on him, not on you.

Meds take a while to really work, so there's going to be a miserable adjustment period if you've just started them. There's likely to also be a lot of dose tweaking and maybe even some medication switching. If you're feeling unstable right now, you can avoid the hospital by being proactive and calling your therapist to see if you can get an extra session soon. You can also call a suicide hotline or a crisis hotline if you feel like you need immediate support. They won't send you to the hospital. Instead, they'll talk to you and help you back away from the ledge by yourself.

And for what it's worth, you're strong. Depression and mental illness in general is tough, and you're fighting it. That's strength. You're in a pretty painful situation right now, and you recognize that you need a little help. That's strength, not weakness. You've got this, and in a few months, you'll be amazed at how well you're doing. Just stick with it for now, and reach out for help when you need it. You're going to be ok.
