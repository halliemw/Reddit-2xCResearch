I bought this one [here](http://www.amazon.com/IQ-Natural-Glycolic-Chemical-Professional/dp/B003QINZLE/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1400193096&sr=8-8&keywords=glycolic+peel+30) I bought this a year ago and it works really well. Test it out on a small part and gradually add more time to how long it stays on.
