I'm going to be honest: it sounds like you dodged a bullet, because in no way shape or form should you have to subject yourself to someone who is that insanely inconsiderate to the fact that you have thoughts and feelings, let alone shallow enough to make a rain puddle appear as if it were the pacific ocean.
