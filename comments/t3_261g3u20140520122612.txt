I up voted your post there. Hopefully it will be seen. 

I think understand how you are feeling. I've actually dated a guy who was almost exactly like you described your ex, except that he eventually started to beat me. I didn't go to therapy afterwards, because i just felt so good not being with him anymore and I just wanted to move on. 

A year later I started therapy anyway, and it was the best choice I've ever made. I found a therapist who works well with me and she has helped me in ways that are hard to describe. It's been almost ten years and I still see her once a month to check in, but things in my head are kind of "sorted out" now, thanks to our sessions. 

Relationships like the one you had with your ex can impact you on many levels. For me, the confusing part was how smart and charming and well off he was in some ways, while being completely broken in other ways. My only regret is that I didn't leave him sooner. But I left, and that's all that matters now.
