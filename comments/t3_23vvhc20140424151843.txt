With a full ride, that frees you up financially to do some other things...like visit Texas on holidays, or fly them up to see you when they're old enough to fly alone. In the meantime, you don't give up on your dreams. Leaving for school isn't going to make these kids think you don't love them, they know, and they'll understand. When they do get to see you it'll just be that much more special.
