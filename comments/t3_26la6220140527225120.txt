OP, I just did a similar thing. But she had been physically violent with me before (almost strangled me, threw things at me, etc.). I have an order of protection, and getting it allowed me to sleep well again. 

I'm glad to see you have support nearby. I highly recommend you read Captain Awkward's blog posts on the "Darth Vader boyfriend," -- "Luke, he's awful!" "No, I sense the good in him!" "Luke, he blew up a planet to prove a point!" "I feel the goodness deep inside him." "... Luke, he cut off your hand. Your whole hand." 

I've also been reading "Why does he do that?" by Lundy Bancroft, if you message me I'll try to share it with you on Amazon. It explains a lot about a person who has abuse issues-- it's not the drugs, it's not his sad history, it's usually not even mental health-- he has a value system that allows him to treat women like shit. You can't cure it by loving it out of him, by treating him well and being good to him. He is an emotional black hole and will devour you. I'm so glad you got out, I'm proud of you, and you'll be able to trust people again one day.
