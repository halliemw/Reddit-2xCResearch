Me, too. I have pretty heavy periods, as described in the first item, and it was a huge disappointment when I had a really bad reaction to HBC and had to stop after only one pack. I know there are different formulas to try but I'm not ready to potentially repeat my experience with side effects again trying to find the right formula.
