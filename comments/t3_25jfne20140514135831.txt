I see that you are still a law student, but for what it's worth I am more than happy to work around verification that preserves your anonymity. For example, one of our members provided me with a blurred bar card that showed active licensure but censored the name, coupled with a postit showing her username and the date/time so I could verify she had possession of the censored card. I also joined /r/lawyers with a censored business card/bar card combo. So you don't necessarily have to show your bar number and name to become a member.

The truth is there are no guarantees of anonymity on the internet, not matter what precautions you take, and there are no guarantees that /r/LadyLawyers will never ever make a mistake and let the wrong person in. We can only do the best we can do. 

ETA: I've considered whether law students/paralegals might be a good addition too. I think that is something I will put to the community once we get going a little more. The restriction to practicing attorneys is to help avoid people searching for free legal advice and/or job begging, in my mind, but that might be able to be avoided even w/ addition of law students/paralegals. Anyway it's a decision for another day. Thank you for your comment!
