I agree op shouldn't go, but I don't think she should make excuses. Saying the harsh truth would be too hard since they are coworkers, but I'd definitly say something along the lines of "I'm sorry I didn't attend, but obviouly this would have a way too stresssful event for you..." Don't be shy of rubbing it in a little bit... After all, the way they did to you was really not ok in my opinion...
