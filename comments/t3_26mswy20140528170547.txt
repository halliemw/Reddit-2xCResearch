Agreed. I remember watching the episodes and thinking the same thing. Because as soon as Amy and Bernadette are introduced; almost in the same sentence they become love interests/girlfriends. And again; the girlfriends aren't nerdy at all! Amy and Bernadette have doctorates in STEM and that's it. 

All too often a typical episode is 

Opening scene: Leonard and Sheldon's living room, the gang is eating takeout
Sheldon makes a funny joke based on SCIENCE!/his neuroses/mainstream "geeky" things
Cue title credits
Something happens: Men go to Comic-book store/S+L's apartment and play nerdy things
Women go to Penny's apartment and complain about men and get drunk. 
Something is usually then resolved by talking when groups come together
End credits. 

I am serious. Has anyone actually done a Bechdel test on this series? Because even with the introduction of the girlfriend units I still don't think it passes
