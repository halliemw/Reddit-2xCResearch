Minimum wage job or not - a letter to your boss needs a less casual greeting than "Hi"! Most places ask for 2 weeks notice, so you are cutting it a little short here. If you need this person for a reference ever, you want to be as professional and courteous about this as possible. Otherwise, it may not matter, but I try to err on the safe side with these things!
