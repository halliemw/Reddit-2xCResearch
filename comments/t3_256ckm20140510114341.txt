Ohhhhhh man! That is super exciting!!! There's no agent that covers for your agent while he/she is out of town? My agent was out of town when I found this house, so her boss had to draw up the offer paperwork. But, my agent was gone for like 10 days not just the weekend. And portlands market is very fast moving so cute houses get offers the first week they're on the market. (Very stressful). I'm sure that if your market isn't as fast, Monday is just fine though.

Good luck on getting your dream house!!!!!
