Yup, I gave up looking for mine after about 10 years of searching, Turns out I was looking in the wrong area because I personally have a deformity. But its amazing how many girls don't know where to even begin looking.

To add onto this, [Vulvul cancer](http://www.cancervic.org.au/about-cancer/cancer_types/vulval_cancer) is a thing, so ladies, when you check your breasts each month, also grab a hand mirror and have a look down below, get familiar with what it looks like.
