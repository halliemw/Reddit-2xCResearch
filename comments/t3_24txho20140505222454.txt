Do you want to try and salvage the friendship?  If yes, talk to him.  If no, then you don't have to.  Sure you can say "you were completely inappropriate at the party 2 weeks ago and I would appreciate it if you would stay away from me."  If you feel safe enough to.  If not, it is not your job to inform him of his creepy behaviour.  

Drunk is not an excuse.  Autistic is not an excuse.  You know what people with actual social issues do when someone tells them they misstep?  They say sorry and stop doing it.  Because we know we are socially awkward and are trying to correct it.  Being defensive about it just makes him more of a jerk.  Making it all about him when apologizing is again being a jerk.  

>  I feel so unreasonable, because nothing actually happened, and rationally I don’t believe R would have done anything.

Please, please, please listen to your instincts instead of your brain trying to given him the benefit of the doubt.  There is no situation where his intentions are more important than you feeling safe.  

If he has good intentions, like you say, then you can try and talk to him.  "I don't like it when you do x, please stop."  Well-meaning people will go “OMG, I am so sorry” and stop doing the thing to the best of their ability.  Entitled and otherwise not well-meaning people get defensive, demand justifications and/or throw the blame somewhere else.  If they keep doing the bad thing (regardless of what the response was), they’re not so well-intentioned.
