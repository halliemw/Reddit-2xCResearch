I'm so sorry :( It's a horrible feeling to have something stolen from you.

I live in a city where stolen bikes are a very daily occurrence (which is why people buy/ride shitty and/or used bikes). Sigh. I can promise you this likely wasn't even your fault! Bike thieves are tricky bastards.

My suggestion for you, for when you do get another one, is to invest in some locks. And I mean invest! [Abus](http://www.abus.com/) is a great brand for them. Don't spend less than 80-100 on a U-Lock, which you can connect the frame to the thing you're locking your bike to. Then I would also get a flexible lock to wrap around both your wheels and to the thing you're locking to as well.
