Then good riddance. You're only supporting a toxic group, and for as hard as it is to say goodbye, maybe you should consider taking things into your own hands. Contact all those members that left, along with the ones remaining that are uncomfortable and start your OWN group. One with rules of conduct where everyone has a right to feel safe in their space. I honestly have no idea how you put up with this guy, I went to art school where comic art was a degree possible and I knew some guys like the one you're describing, and I'd have chewed them out ages ago for being such sick, sexist pigs.
