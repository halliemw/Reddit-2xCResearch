I know it's frustrating and it sucks but you have to keep going back to the OBGYN describing all of your symptoms in detail for instance; pain-when? where? frequency? Does it move? Describe it. And also tell  them every single about the urine When is it cloudy? When is there blood? How much? What color? Don't be afraid to write this all down and make sure you've told them everything they need to know about what has happen since you finished anti-fungals. Ask for a referral to a urologist.
