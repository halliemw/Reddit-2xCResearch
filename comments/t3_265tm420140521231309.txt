I don't know what your particular guy was doing in the hot tub, but when I only use the hot tub after working out and I do something a bit like that.

What I'm actually doing under the water is this:

and I twist my body so that the water jet is pulsing directly onto the area I'm stretching. After a while, I'll swap sides.

I also do this, under the water too:

and a variation of this, where I face the wall, and push my chest into the water jets:

I do leg stretches along the ledge too, which usually mean I'm side on to the jets, like the hurdler's stretch. The hot tub is absolute magic for aching muscles and it's definitely improved my recovery time!

Then again, the guy in your hot tub might well have just been masturbating!
