My SO does this all the time. One second we're talking about asking someone to hang out, next thing I know there's 8 people playing board games in my living room. 

He's never meant anything malicious by it, he just likes socializing. I'm fine with it sometimes but other times I just want to be with one or two other people at most. I've talked to him about it before and he's always understanding. 

Just say that you don't mean anything bad on his dad or anything (I assume you don't) but you would have just wanted to know ahead of time.
