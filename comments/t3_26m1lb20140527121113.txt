So the author states that Men who aren't rapists, etc...are still part of the problem if we don't do anything. I've heard this before, but they never follow up and give us some examples of WHAT we could be doing. I'll offer to walk my female colleagues to their cars if we work late but beyond that we can regular guys do to help with issues like #YesAllWomen?
