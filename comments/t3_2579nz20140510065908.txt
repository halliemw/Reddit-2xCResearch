You are right that poem was a threat designed to make you feel guilty and suck you in. Just ignore it and don't respond. It seems encouraging that he is still avoiding you at school, if that changes you might have to confront him and make a complaint at the school. Don't feel disgusting, this is NOT your fault. Sorry, I just told you how you should not feel, my intention was to point out that you are blameless, he chose to target you.

edit; sub par grammar, not enough coffee.
