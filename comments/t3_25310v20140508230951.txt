As a guy, I would love a job that offered that perk.

That said.

I think making a mandatory part of training for either gender is pretty bad form. Ideally I would suggest something like that be scheduled at 5PM (or whatever time your office normally finishes work). That way it's truly an optional perk for anyone who's interested in it and not something that is directly a part of your work day.
