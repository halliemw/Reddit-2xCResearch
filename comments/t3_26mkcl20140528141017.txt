You can make the argument that, all else equal, someone who has not been raped will go through less trauma in this process than someone who has not.  That, however, doesn't necessarily support your assertion that this is why false rape accusations happen.  Firstly, less trauma does not mean no trauma, or that the supposed benefits of being thought to have been raped will somehow outweigh the costs involved in being publicly labeled as a rape victim.  

Secondly, making any claim about false rape is difficult because we don't know how many false rape claims there are.  False rape accusations are exceedingly difficult to measure.  Not only does measuring a false allegation involve proving a negative, but it's complicated by police actions and prejudices, as well as different definitions and different laws across jurisdictions and studies.  For a good explanation, take a look at [this](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=430300&jid=CLJ&volumeId=65&issueId=01&aid=430299) paper.  Sorry, it's paywalled, but [the wiki on the subject](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Rumney_.282006.29) has a decent discussion of some of the problems it reports.  Yet despite these problems, and despite the wringer that someone making an accusation of rape has to go through, the belief that false rape accusations are common persists.  Avoid buying into this belief.  Doing so makes it even harder for someone who has been raped to come forward. 

I understand where you're coming from, and I understand your frustration with having your argument attacked.  The system shouldn't be set up in a way that humiliates those who have been raped.  However, your attack on that system, however well-intentioned, involves the perpetuation of a damaging myth about rape.  Putting the problem in terms of a true:false rape accusation ratio does so inherently.  Don't do that, especially not when there's no way to prove that the thing you're trying to minimize (false rape accusations) occur often at all.
