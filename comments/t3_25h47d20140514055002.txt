You're right, but the only reason *anybody* doesn't break laws/rules is by choice. Our law enforcement is reactionary, not preventative. And while men are more likely to be violent/strong, that doesn't mean that *every* man is going to be violent. Most people have some awareness of this sort of thing, and won't make advances unless it is in a non-threatening, public environment.
