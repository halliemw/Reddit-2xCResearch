I once had my landlord slip an envelope under my door. It said something to the effect of "There has been numerous complaints about the resident 'moving furniture' in the middle of the night and/or 'woodworking'. Please refrain from rearranging your apartment until the afternoon or hammering in the middle of the night." 

So thinly veiled. My girlfriend tried to keep it down, but for reasons I can't comprehend most women can't seem to refrain from moaning. I don't know why men can have sex completely silent but literally every women I've been with absolutely has to moan. Not moaning isn't option.
