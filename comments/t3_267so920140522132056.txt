Mine doesn't really change with eating. It's either bloated when I wake up or it isn't. If it's slightly bloated when I wake up, it seems to gets worse as the day goes on. If it's flatter it tends to stay that way for the day. I've not really noticed it with my cycle, or at least it doesn't seem to connect to it because it's so random. I do get some bloating when I come off my pill for the week or if I'm ever spotting while on the pill, but that's the only connection I have! I'm hoping the probiotics help a bit. Or at least let me rule out a bacterial/digestive issue. :)
