Unfortunately in a lot of cases it has nothing to do with training, it's the law. They *have* to ask, in my state:

 - whether you want to look at the ultrasound
 - whether you want to listen to a heartbeat, if there is one
 - whether you want to know if it's twins.

Coupled with a 72-hour "waiting period" the sole purpose of these laws is to make terminating a pregnancy such a torturous experience that some decide against it. It's unconscionable, but it's the way the laws are because the people who don't care don't pay attention on the whole, and those opposed to safe and legal abortion are so much more vocal.
