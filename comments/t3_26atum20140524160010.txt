Definitely. On my block recently(I live on a very quiet, residential block in Brooklyn) there was some dude just walking up and down the street yelling stupid shit at women on the block(every insult you can think of to call a woman, he was using, ad nauseum). Now, this is not a block full of shrinking violets. The ladies basically said "Man, we aren't looking for shit on this block. This is a quiet block, just leave." and he wouldn't. He started to get more aggressive and started to puff up, walking behind women going back to their apartments and calling them sluts and whatnot. Two of the guys on the block got together and basically told him to leave. He wasn't leaving, so they chased him down the block.

I felt pretty comforted after that. I mean, I knew the block was populated by good people(my neighbors regularly knock on my door to tell me if I'm parked on the wrong side of the block), but it was great to see.
