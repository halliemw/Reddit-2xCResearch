There were two guys at my work discussing rolf harris's recent accusations of molesting women and girls, they were being very flippant and even said that 'any woman can just make up an allegation and BAM you're career's gone'....they said this in the lunch room of a government building while there was a woman standing right next to them, are they just incredibly stupid or is this how people actually feel?

Reading this it seems that this may be a common way of thinking and that is distressing to say the least.
