It's OP, I forgot my throwaway password. anyway, it's actually myself and another girl who work in the design department. She just informed me that last year she filled in at the front desk a few times during lunch breaks when they asked, so our editor told our boss she should be invited to Admin Day. We are more similar to the IT department or the guys who design boats (it's a marine company) then the admins, but none of the guys from there got invited.
