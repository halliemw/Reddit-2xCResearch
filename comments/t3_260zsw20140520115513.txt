/u/PoniesRBitchin mentioned checking out a Unitarian church as a possible spiritual home for the two of you. I would second that and, additionally, recommend you making an appointment to talk to a Unitarian Universalist minister. Because of the openness of UUism, ministers are well versed in many different beliefs and perspectives, and often see couples who are struggling to reconcile very different views.
