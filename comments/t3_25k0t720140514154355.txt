Uhhh... I have a few. Grew up with a lot of people who weren't educated about sex. 

- You can't get pregnant if you're breastfeeding. One of my friends has 2 little girls less than a year apart thanks to this.

- Use the showerhead to squirt hot water up your vagina after sex, it'll kill the sperm. Another friend always did this, got pregnant senior year, didn't understand why her "birth control" failed her.

- If you're pregnant and take your birth control pill accidentally it'll cause an abortion. 

- A teaspoon of vinegar a day will work as birth control. This is from my grandmother. Catholic, wasn't allowed to use contraceptives, thought she was being sneaky about it. She has 5 children and thinks god punished her for trying to get around that.
