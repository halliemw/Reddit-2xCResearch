I would like to add on to this, I'm on medication that will react to having hormones in my bloodstream (lowering the efficiency of both the med *and* the BC), so I have a Mirena and it works swimmingly. The first month or so was a bit hellish because my uterus was doing a bit of a WTF is this DO ALL THE CRAMPING TO EJECT IT, but now its awesome. The hormones stay localized to my uterus (where there are hormones anyway) and I don't have to worry about daily pills or anything. I know I was really nervous about it and as a precaution went on pills for about a month ahead of time to make sure I had no weird reactions to the hormones (getting a thing in and THEN finding out you have reactions would be bad) but I'm glad I did.

I will reiterate though, don't do anything you aren't comfortable with, but also recognize that your boyfriend does also have a vested interest in birth control as well so while he cannot dictate what you do with your body (ie, forcing you), he can dictate what he does with his (ie, deciding he isn't comfortable with sex). Talk about it, be respectful to both of your boundaries, and see what you come up with. You might also want to consider just going in and talking with your doctor about your options. I was already considering the IUD before I went in, but I did not know about the interactions with my other meds and that *drastically* altered my options. They may be able to aleviate some of your concerns as well as give you accurate information for your body and help you decide on something you feel comfortable with.
