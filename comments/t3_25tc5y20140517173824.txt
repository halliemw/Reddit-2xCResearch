I still can't believe this is happening to me. It's been a rollercoaster of emotions. If I distract myself, I feel normal, but the second my thoughts get away from me I think about court, I have flashbacks, I can't stop shaking. This is who I am now and I feel like I'll never be normal again. Especially if he goes free. 

I just wish I wasn't alone. I want to be held and told everything will be okay so badly.
