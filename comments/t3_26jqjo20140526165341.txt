Try finding a club on meetup.com. I've joined one (20 somethings in my city) a few weeks ago and I've met a few people that I consider friends, despite me not knowing them for a long time. I also get along with men more than women, due to my morbid sense of humor, so meetup has been great in the sense that the groups were big enough where if i didn't connect with someone i could move on.

Also when searching for clubs via meetup you don't have to go just by age, you can go for "ladies only". My recommendation is to read the reviews of the group and make sure it's active.
