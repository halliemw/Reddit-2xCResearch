Thank you for sharing this with me! I feel like I direct my neediness and random insecurity at my partner when pmsing as opposed to anger an distress, in fact these days in the days of neediness I tend to try and avoid speaking to him haha. This is all bearing in mind a lot of people tell me how chill I am usually and I don't consider myself insecure at any other time of the month. Cramps have actually calmed down as the mood swings have gotten worse- I started bleeding today and haven't needed any painkillers yet whereas last year only codeine could improve the pain- but to be honest I'd swap them back around if I could! I have heard from a friend magnesium supplements can help with mood swings, I'm going to give them a try and they may also help you!
