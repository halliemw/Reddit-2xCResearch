I am the national average in height, am 25, and have been mistaken for being in high school. My roommate is very short, 25, and same thing. It's more how your face is structured rather than height. At least that's my experience. I say this because my roommate looks very womanly, more than me, but we both have very cute faces, which makes us look young. Try not to freak out and blame your height. I personally just laugh and say thanks. I have quite a few wrinkles (thanks pale skin/genetics!) so I say no harm done.
