The Red Pill does have some... I won't say redeeming qualities, but I think that there are some things that are beneficial.  But their attitudes towards women are straight up unhealthy.  It's one thing to talk about sexism against men, and talk about the shitty things that women do to men in relationships, but their attitudes towards women are awful, and they leave no room for other perspectives whatsoever.  TwoX can be the same way with certain topics, I'm sure, but there is no overarching theme of "men deserve no respect, they don't make good friends, or really even good partners, they're only good for sex, they're completely uninteresting, they *will* lie, cheat and steal from you given the chance, and if they happen to not do any of those things, they are capable of turning on you at any given moment.

TRP can give you good insights, like "Don't put women on a pedestal" and "improve yourself if you want to find someone" and "don't take this kind of shit from women, because you don't need to anymore."  Those are decent takeaways, but I really do think anyone who stays in that sub too long will develop really unhealthy attitudes towards women, whether they want to or not.  It seems to have gotten especially disturbing over the last year, but I don't know if I'm making that up.  And they think anyone against them is "stupid" like most people with a narrow perspective.  It's just too bad that is the kind of "help" men get.
