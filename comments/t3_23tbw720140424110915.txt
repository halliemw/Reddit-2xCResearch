21, veggie for a couple years, Californian, bookworm, travel-obsessed, health and wellness oriented, guilty pleasure tv marathoner. I work a lot and am in college, I don't usually have the time to hang out with my old friends (they live an hour away and have their own busy schedules). I do have time for texting, emails, and phone calls though! I've had more than a couple great friendships start online, pm me if you want to chat!
