I don't really see how this is going to help the subreddit grow. This subreddit, like many others, should stay a relatively small community. Unlike something like /r/askreddit, a lot of the posts here apply to a very small percentage of the Reddit userbase. This subreddit is great for those who can use it for its proper purpose, but isn't for everyone.
