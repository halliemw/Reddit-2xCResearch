I literally JUST watched half of these movies. I found the female protagonists in Mononoke, Laputa, and Howl's excellent examples of well-done female characters. But Nausicaa, maybe because it's one of Miyazaki's earlier films, does a poorer job (I think), mostly because the titular character is the only one in the film to cry at the drop of a hat, and keeps needing to be saved by others. The other female character in the film, Princess Kushana, however, is very reminiscent of later (authoritarian, sometimes masculine) characters like Lady Eboshi and Suliman that are excellently portrayed.
