Because when you step into legal matters, you become an identity - which, unless relevant, has no opinions or thoughts. If everyone could apply that logic, we would see a lot of people wearing masks, hats and all that sort of things into legal pictures (like passports and health insurance). Hell, going even further, since this was (because it changed) law, I could TOTALLY choose not to abide by them and claim religious belief. It would be anarchy. And that's completely ignoring the fact that it also inflicts a negative bias against those who do not practice the religion - a non-Muslim could not pull this shit.
