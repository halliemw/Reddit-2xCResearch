Endometriosis runs in my family too! My mom, grandma, and great grandma have all had it and my mom also had surgery and induced menopause. I'm worried that I have it to. I don't have any suggestions in what to ask - I've been wondering that myself! But good luck :). I'd be very interested in what anyone has to say !
