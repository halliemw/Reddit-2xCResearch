i also don't want children and am your age but i'm afraid of having surgery. Of course pregnancy isn't a worry for me right now because i've never had sex but have you researched the surgery and what it would mean for you hormonally? I am considering it as well but i worry about the side effects, if there are any, and the dangers of an unnecessary surgery.
