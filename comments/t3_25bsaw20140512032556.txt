One day at a time, on breath at a time. For as long as you need. When everything is impossible, take a breath and do what you can. Leave the rest for when you can. 

I'm not a religious person. But of all things that truly helped me when I faced my own loss, a line from The Night Prayer in the New Zealand Book of Prayer became my mantra:

It is night after a long day. 
What has been done has been done; 
what has not been done has not been done. 
Let it be. 

I'm so sorry for your loss. Truly, and from the bottom of my heart. I hope you have support as you rebuild yourself after this loss. Seek help when you need it. Don't be afraid to lean. There are more of us than you realize who will lend a shoulder.
