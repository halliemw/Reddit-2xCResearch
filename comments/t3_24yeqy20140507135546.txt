poverty is associated with violence, inner city areas are rife with poverty, the main demographically affected race by poverty is blacks (http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/poverty-rate-by-raceethnicity/), therefore by correlation black inner city kids = violence. 

Racism means you feel your race is better, I'd say in this situation that it's living situations that define the boyfriend's concern.
