Honestly, a weapon is worse.  She, like most people, is unlikely to fire until it's too late, and he can take it from her.  She's a good person, and she doesn't want to shoot and maybe kill someone unless she absolutely has to, and by the time you know without a doubt, 100% that it's necessary to pull the trigger?  It's way too late.  I'm not calling OP weak, by the way.  This is very normal and honestly a good thing.  It means she's an empathetic human being.

The self-defense classes will make her feel better and stronger, should she get backed into a corner, and less likely to be confined to her home.  They don't mean she'll run out and attack *him*.  Most people are smarter than that.
