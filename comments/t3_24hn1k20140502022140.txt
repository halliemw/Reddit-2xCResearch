I'm a father of 2 in the UK, and in my experience, places will either have baby changing just in the disabled loo, or, if they have baby change in the women's, they also tend to have them in the men's as well. I know Marks and Spencer's does, Ikea does, the local soft play centre does, and our designer outlet centre has a baby changing room (not just a table!) in each bathroom.

Those are the ones I remember off the top of my head, so I'm pretty sure it is quite common these days to put them in both.

Then again, by far the most common arrangement I have encountered is to just put them in the (unisex) disabled loo, which makes sense - after all, disabled loos aren't needed as often as the non-disabled toilets.
