I grew up in a big city. Not as bad as Brooklyn but definitely not the place where you can leave your door unlocked 24/7.

I still don't get super paranoid. I stay aware of what's around me and avoid deliberately dangerous situations, but I think that's a part of living anywhere, male or female.

I never got the whole "I'm scared to walk down the street because I'm paranoid that the people in the cars might be following me" mentality. It just doesn't seem worth it to be worried all the time.
