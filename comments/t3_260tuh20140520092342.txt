I'm fairly certain the whole "crush" phase is mainly caused by hormones during puberty. Obviously people can have crushes after that. I personally have had crushes but I suggest looking into "vegetarian" life styles. Which is quite prevalent in Japan, where the younger generation of males and femals choose not to seek a relationship and focus on their jobs / enjoying life. 

I personally wouldn't worry about it, whether you discover you like men or women you're body will tell you when and what you want.
