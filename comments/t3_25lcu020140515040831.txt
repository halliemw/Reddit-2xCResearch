The reason they're marketed as "girl bikes" is that "boy bikes" are incredibly impractical if you're wearing a skirt, which when these styles of bikes were originally marketed, pretty much all girls wore skirts. I prefer one because of the whole skirt thing as well, though I don't wear them often and right now I have a "boy bike" because it was free and I had two bikes stolen within a year and couldn't afford another bike and a quality lock to prevent thefts. On the one hand, it's bad that they're gendered when there's no reason one gender can't ride either bike, but on the other hand, the reason women might prefer a "girl bike" makes it make sense to gender the marketing a little bit, though I think it should be something more like "good for riding in skirts" in the description. I suspect the gendered bikes have stayed this way in marketing because it gives families with multiple children a (bad) reason not to pass down used bikes to younger siblings and instead buy new.
