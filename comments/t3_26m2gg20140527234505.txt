Holy hell, is your mom my mom?  Mine sounds just like that...

Anyways, I've always said that just because someone gave birth to you doesn't give them the right to be an ass.  My mother is a very emotionally manipulative crap bag. My dad passed away when I was younger, and she resents me for being more like him and, frankly, liking him a lot more. 

I turn into this shell of a person when I talk to her/interact with her in any way. I am stressed and anxious and upset. And I think, if I had that with another person, would I continue that particular relationship?  Absolutely not. So why should it be the same with this older woman who is completely mean to me, just because she gave birth to me?

We are adults, we deserve to be treated with respect.  Frankly, when we were children, we still deserved at least *some* respect.  This person has screwed that up in my life for 25 years, and thus, is losing her own child as a presence in her life.  

Sorry, this turned into a vent session for me.  OP, you are not alone. And do NOT feel like a bad person--there are many of us out there with the same thoughts/feelings/etc about the person who gave birth to us.  

I have a new job, a new boyfriend, a new apartment--I wish dearly I could be like "Look mom, I want to show you my place!" or "I've found someone special" but I can't.  And that's okay! As I get older, it gets easier to just not care.  I used to feel terrible about disliking my own mother.  It gets much easier as you get older.
