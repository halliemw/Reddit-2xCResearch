"Come and take it." is a phase often used in defiance. These days its most commonly used by the pro gun/ 2nd amendment crowd when they talk about how Obama is after their guns.    

As a historic tidbit that relates to Texas, the phrase was written on the Texas battle flag at the Battle of Gonzales.

The latin translation, "Molon labe" is also often used. You're suggestion that the OP is somehow inviting rape seems pretty far off base to me. Its not like she wrote "Molon labia" on her cap...
