That's a defeatist attitude!  Besides, if there's an outcry for it, there is clearly demand, just not from heterosexual guys.  They could be gaining even more audience members by providing more male nudity.  The ones who like it will start watching it and the ones who don't will stop.  But if we were in a room and I was watching it with one of my guy friends and them they start getting upset because there is more male nudity, I would think it would be pretty pathetic and hypocritical of them to not be able to handle that level of male nudity when they expect me to be fine with the fifty pair of tits, ass, and vag in each episode.
