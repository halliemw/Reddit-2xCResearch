Oh hey! I just had a lecture from the scientist working on the vaginal microbiome, and it's potential connections to BV!!

So, it probably means your pH is high and maybe they observed unexpected bacteria, unless they were doing some fancier testing (genetic screening for specific bacteria - don't know if this even exists on a clinical basis for BV). 

To give a bit of background, the bacterial community in the vagina is really stable for some people and not so much for others, and this appears to be related to the species of Lactobacillus present. But you won't necessarily have the same species throughout your lifetime - there can be a whole-scale community shift, for example during and after an infection.

Getting more directly to your question (and this is very much not diagnostic or medical advice). Before I mentioned that the vaginal microbiome has variable stability. So, some populations (potentially the less stable ones) can clinically look like BV (high pH, species that may be regarded as diagnostic for BV) but without any symptoms. Now if this is what's going on with you it may be that you have increased risk of BV, but you'd not necessarily have symptoms again. 

But you should talk with your doctor, because I'm an internet stranger speculating wildly based on science that is too new to actually be part of accepted diagnosis or treatment.
