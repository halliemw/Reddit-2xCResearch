Thanks for your response that was really helpful to hear the reasoning behind it and what it actually is which my doctor failed to do. It's like he doesn't consider me competenr!/intelligent enough to tell me these things almost. 

My symptoms weren't just low energy and no motivation though. Ugh new I should have trusted my instincts but I didn't have the medical knowledge to back it up. I'll see what my PCP can do, thanks for the suggestion.
