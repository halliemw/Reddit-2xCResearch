Yeah, I was clarifying why Gravity could still be considered "feminist," or have great female characters, without passing the Bechdel test :)

>  Then again, I don't see that test as feminist gospel...Sandra Bullock kicks ass in Gravity, but she never talks to another woman.

EDIT to clarify misconceptions: I haven't actually watched Gravity. I was explaining more generally why a movie could still portray women as fully fleshed characters and not pass the Bechdel Test. The quote above seemed to indicate uncertainty as to how the Bechdel Test worked, and I was explaining it in a bit more context.
