This. I think this is why I kept trying to reach out to him and ask him why.

This is the response I got:
"Not manipulative or mean, but your perception is your reality. Things just didn't go your way and you couldn't deal. And I did nothing to make it better. That's it. If you ever want to try again, I'm here. Enjoy your anxiety and whatever other issues you might have. M profile clearly said I was a busy guy. So like I said your perception is your reality."


So, I need to not seek an answer for him, because I will never get one.
