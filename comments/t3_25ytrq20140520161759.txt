This was FIVE FUCKING YEARS AGO. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Seriously though. My desire to not view ONE IMAGE during a presentation FIVE YEARS AGO has really not negatively impacted me in anyway. If that one instance is indicative of me somehow avoiding the issue entirely (which, seeing as I have spent like 2 days talking about it on here, is clearly not the case), then I guess I'm fucked and just don't know it.
