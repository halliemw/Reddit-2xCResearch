Great question.  Not sure why it's downvoted...
I don't think the hair is intrinsically feminine, but a woman can still be feminine with body hair for sure.  

I would LOVE to stop shaving/waxing etc.  I just don't want to endure hearing about it from others.  It's not what people are used to seeing, so I'm just not ready to be the one to break the world-view for everyone. 

I do have one friend that doesn't shave.  People will make little snide comments hear and there but she pulls it off for the most part.  However, everyone agrees that she pulls it off because she has modelesque beauty (she actually was a fashion model for a while).  If someone average looking like me tried it, I know I would endure all kinds of ridicule.
