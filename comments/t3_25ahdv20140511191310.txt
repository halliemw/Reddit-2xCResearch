Ha yeah, this is definitely a good point, it's easy to take intern work for granted because you forget the cool projects you get to work on and feel like you can't take much credit on them if you're just a cog in the wheel, but even at bigger jobs you're going to be working under someone most of the time. I have to admit this thread made me go through my resume and realize that I said I "assisted on research" on a research assistant job, then I realized "wait, I conducted research, what the hell, I'm allowed to say that."
