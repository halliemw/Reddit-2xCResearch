:/ that's tough. However, I have had doctors be really dramatic in the past over things that weren't that serious, so maybe when they elaborate it won't be so bad. Even if it is, you have options. There are specialists you can talk to and groups you can seek out. Find something you love to throw yourself into and become passionate about and maybe it will help you heal. Best of luck.
