Maybe bring a movie or two to let her choose from that you could watch together?  She may be out of kleenex, need cough drops, want some ginger ale, or anything else... It sounds like you want to surprise her, and that's really sweet, but you're probably best off letting her know you're stopping at the store and asking what she personally would like. :)
