Thank you for all of this! I did a quick google search of my username and nothing showed up (my last name is fairly common so there are lots of similar usernames or website titles out there) but I couldn't drag and drop directly from instagram. 

I'm going to leave the account as private for a few weeks and before I open it back up to the public I'll delete some of the pictures, especially those with the comments on them because I don't know how else to delete the comments (unless the harassing user deletes their account). 

As I'm graduating Saturday a nice cold drink was already in order!
