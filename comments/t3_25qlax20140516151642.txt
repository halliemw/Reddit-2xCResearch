I'm not a huge fan. I think it's probably the wrong size for me, and I know there are a ton of other options, but I don't feel like spending the time/money trying to find the right fit.  

If you google, you can find comparisons of the various different brands to help you decide which one to buy if you're going to take the plunge.  

But yeah, it wasn't successful for me - putting it in was easy enough, but I was super aware of it the whole time and never really got comfortable (even after cutting some of the stem off). It held overnight great, but taking it out was stressful too.
