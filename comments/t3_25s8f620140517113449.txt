That's a bit harsh. How would you feel if thousands of people came up to you, in real life, and said: "iammayotte, you look like like shit. Your are fat and your dress is hideous. What were you thinking? Look, your appalling appearance is so shameful it is being discussed in detail on the television and in magazines.". I bet it would have an impact on you. 


And to Sarah Millican's credit, she's going to wear the same bloody dress to the next red carpet event.
