That's fair. I'm not entirely sure what you're using to decide what in the Bible is right and what is wrong, but if it's the same thing you're using to decide those same things in the rest of the world, why is the Bible even necessary in the scheme of things?

Regardless, more power to you for being reasonable and trying to be a compassionate person.
