You seem to struggle with reading comprehension. Not seeing anything in there where it's saying "*men* oppress women". Actually, not seeing anything where it says "*men* do anything". It uses "a social system" as the subject of the sentence. Men are not specifically mentioned anywhere in that paragraph.

"Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction."
