I've got a [Novara Verita](http://www.rei.com/product/837485/novara-verita-bike-2014) in a brown color scheme. She's heavier than my old Trek that got stolen, but I love her anyway. (Note the lack of step-through frame. ;) )

I looked on CostCo's website and unless they have different modesl in store and online, I think [this](http://www.costco.com/Diamondback-Wildwood-26%22-Classic-Men's-Sport-Comfort-Bike-.product.100082568.html) might be your bike. If so, it's a great bike for your needs. Diamondback makes quality bikes.
