After my last break-up, I felt like nothing could make me feel better than reminding myself that no matter how much it hurt, staying with it would only have been worse. You sound like you were a great girlfriend, and you take that with you--all that good is you! Breaking up after years is so disorienting and hard though, so I hope you will take the time and do little things for yourself.
