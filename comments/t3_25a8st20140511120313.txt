Thank you, I will.

I did some research on Endo and didn't realize pushing pre menopause was an option. I have no kids and *absolutely* no interest in having any- so that would actually be nice. No more awful periods, no more worrying about pregnancy etc. The problem with things like that are that you are hard up to find any doc willing to do anything permanent for women as far as making it impossible to reproduce. **My choice- my body**- why do they care? Oh, yeah, they would likely be the doc to see my through a pregnancy wanted or not- so they would be losing out on money... Sorry- it's been an irritating journey...
