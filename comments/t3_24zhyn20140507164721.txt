I'm an only daughter who has a great relationship with my father (not with my mother).

The biggest thing is to be supportive. My dad was (and still is) always, always, always there for me. Whether I was scared of my first day of school, had to drive to karate tournaments in another state on the weekends, had to be at cheer practice at the ass crack of dawn in the summer, or my car broke down on the way back to college, I've always known all I ever have to do is pick up the phone and say, "Daddy, I need you." and everything will be ok, no matter what. 

Another big thing is expectations. My dad always expected me to do my best, no matter what the issue was. He knew when I wasn't doing my best, and he knew when I was and maybe that still wasn't enough. That was the perfect standard to hold me to.

And I think the final thing is don't box her in. Don't expect certain things just because she's a girl. I am a girl who - when younger - played with matchbox cars in the dirt, watched CHIPS, and excelled at karate. Being a female is a hard road to travel sometimes - figuring out how "girly" you are, etc - so just support her and don't box her in to your own expectations of who she is.

You'll do great! And we're here if you need any help in the future.
