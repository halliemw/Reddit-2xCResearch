Wow. So next time my partner comes home trashed and looking to get laid, I'll say no, and tell them in the morning that it would have been wrong for me to have had sex with them while they were drunk. Seriously? It's just sex. It's not like they showed up at my tattoo parlor and I inked them knowing that they were f'd up. Only way I would see this as unmistakably "wrong" would be if the guy in question admitted that the OP didn't seem into it at all but he decided to push anyway. Then he's an ass and she's well rid of him.
