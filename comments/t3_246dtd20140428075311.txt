I'm quite stressed and my students are idiots. And I have to lead them through a seminar for which I'm not really prepared and I'm angry with them for being dicks. And I have had no time to do my research and my supervisor is like "you're going to fail unless you get a move on."

But really that's nothing. You need some time off! And why say yes to anal sex if you're terrified? Better to take a break from sex until you're 100% healthy again.
