That can describe our moderation policy on most subjects though. There's a time and a place for respectful discussion and there's a time and a place for support. If this is true:

>I don't get my feelings hurt easy and I'm not one to lecture others about their decisions. I don't give advice unless someone asks it, and I don't condemn anyone for the decisions that they make.

I think you'll be fine here, we have lots of lively debates and discussions on all sorts of topics ranging from feminism to periods to makeup and everything in between.

Welcome! :)
