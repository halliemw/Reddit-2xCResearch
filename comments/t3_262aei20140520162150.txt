Thanks for posting, you offer some great perspective and a few thought experiments.  

However, at the end of the day, the abortion debate is entirely a legal matter.  I don't like abortions, the concept doesn't make me feel good, and I am not looking for a punchcard.  But, above all, they should be legal, safe, and available.
