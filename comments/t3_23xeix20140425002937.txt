My SO couldn't even fit in two fingers but we had sex no problem once we added lube. Still can't have sex without it, but it's no big deal once you have it on hand! Think about trying to get a too-tight ring of your finger - not a chance when your hands are dry, but wet your finger a little and the ring comes right off.
