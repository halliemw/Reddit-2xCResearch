>I dunno, I think without the whole thrush thing I could have lived my life pretty okay without having to really deal with it.

This is so sad to me. I understand that you have this anxiety, but I feel like it's causing you to really downplay the importance of maintaining your health (both mental and physical), and furthermore to respond in a really defensive way when people offer you their advice. Obviously you don't have to take it, but my feeling most of the people here wouldn't suggest these things if they didn't want to help you with your issue.
