Whatever you do, don't delete the messages. Start a paper trail and get a record of all the interactions between you and him that you can. If he doesn't back off after clearly telling him to you should look into getting a restraining order put in place. 

It might also be a good idea to avoid going out alone at odd hours/places and make sure other people know about it as well. You aren't responsible for his happiness etc, he has obvious issues mentally that he needs addressed professionally.
