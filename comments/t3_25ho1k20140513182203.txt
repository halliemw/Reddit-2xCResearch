how is that a bitch move when you didn't know the hours were given away? Anyways, I believe hard working faithful employees should be given the same respect and loyalty a company expects from them. Essentially giving your livelihood away to a relative is a bitch move on your bosses part, especially considering she didn't even tell you. Keep the hours and stand up for yourself! This talk of drama shouldn't even be a factor in a professional environment, if it is I would immediately contact HR. They are there to help with potential problems such as this one.
