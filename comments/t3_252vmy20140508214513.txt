Something to consider: if he is more devoted to his career than anything else right now, there is a good chance that his mentality will not change even if he marries or has children. Not to say that he wouldn't be loving and all that - but if you marry him and bear his children, it will probably be your responsibility to do all that is needed to tend to family's needs, excluding bread-winning. Any career aspirations you have may become secondary to tending a family for a while.
   Ultimately, if you desire a family and children, you may need to decide what kind of partner you want to grow a family with - one who is most devoted to work, or one who is more devoted to the family and spending time helping you raise kids.
