Husband here. 5 year relationship. 2 kids (3yro and newborn).

I don't clean much. I swipe the floors on a daily basis. I cook dinner and lunch. I prepare my daughter's lunchbox (meal, dessert, snack, fruit, etc.) and her backpack for daycare. I do the dishes occasionally. I clean the upper floor bathroom and the dorms when required. I mow the lawn when needed. I go to the grocery store when needed. I do other on-demand chores (laundry, etc.)

My wife cleans more than I do. She does the dishes on a daily basis. Laundry, lower floor bathroom, deep cleaning, etc. We've argued several hundred times about how I'd need to do more. I agree with her. I'm lazy and she's by far more busy with the baby than I am.

We've never used the argument "you are AVAILABLE and NOT EXHAUSTED". This argument is bullshit. Like you said, he's more efficient (less effort, more results, more time to be *available*).

You're pissed for other stuff. You don't like him quitting his job. You don't like doing chores.

The relationship does not have to be *equal*, it has to be consensual. Discuss and agree on what each one will do. Once you both are OK with how many chores each one should do, the arguments should stop. Unless, of course, you're using the chores as an excuse to bring other stuff up (like him quitting his job).
