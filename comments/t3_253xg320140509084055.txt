Weddings are tough because they make you feel like you have to have people to fill in these cookie cutter roles. But real lives don't look like that- not everyone has an even number of bridesmaids and groomsmen who look great on each other's arm and perfectly behaved little cherubs to bring in the ring and throw the petals. This wedding should be a reflection of your life, not a production for the people you've invited- who, believe me, will not even notice if you don't have attendants on your wedding day.

My parents had no bridal party when they got married, just five year old me to hold my moms hand while they married. I have my best friend and my brother standing for me, and my FH has five people he's asked, and that's okay! I'm just like you, I like a quiet life at home, and I don't have many friends. If I asked more people to stand for me to make an even set, that would cheapen the honor of the two people I have standing for me.

Weddings will make you feel all kinds of inadequacies that don't belong to you in your regular life. If that's what this is, then don't feel bad at all not having attendants if you don't feel right asking people who aren't very special to you. If this is the catalyst making you realize you *do* want to get out there and make more friends, then go for it, but only because it will make you happier- not as a search for people who might be your bridesmaids.
