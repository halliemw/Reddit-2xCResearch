She let him in because he could easily and more angrily climb through her window. You said it right there, "you've never been raped" and "Maybe it's something [you] won't understand unless it happens." I think it's helpful to admit the not understanding rather than dismissing her reaction. It's difficult to put yourself in her shoes and perhaps, sadly I can because I've experienced something similar. I encourage reading the comments and perhaps re-reading the parts where she says that she thinks the cops won't believe her and "If I give him what he wants, maybe he'll go away." 

I don't feel as though I can guess what else was going through her mind, but for me, I definitely thought about protecting my family, my sisters, and if it took putting up with so be it. Also, I was so young I had no idea what was going on before it was too late. Last, but not least, being raised in a culture where the hard topics are avoided, it was easy and expected to keep my mouth shut. I'm currently in the process of being more open and trying to figure my past out, so I can have a better future. I'm taking the baby steps to talk more about my own history to hopefully inspire others to do the same and seek help.
