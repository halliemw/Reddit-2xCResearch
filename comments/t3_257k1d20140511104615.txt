I am one of those weirdos who likes having her period on the pill. It's like a reminder to know I'm still fertile (nope, not menopause yet!) and I tend to get constipated/bloaty if I don't allow the monthly flow (period shits or no shits for me, apparently). 

And having a period gives me an excuse to treat myself for a few daysâ€¦
