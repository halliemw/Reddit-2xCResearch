Yeah, if I'm to be honest, I've been probably feeling this way more often than I'd like lately.

I think part of it is I've been realizing that I don't really fit in with my group of friends. This is a particularly hard pill to swallow because I thought that I finally found my niche when we first met and started hanging out. But the more I get to know them, the more I feel disconnected from them. I don't really know many people outside of them though, so I've just been feeling really lonely...
