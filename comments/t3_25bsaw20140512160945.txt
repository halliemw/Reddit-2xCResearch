It is a game, but we can't know all the pieces. The feeling of control we achieve by threatening our own life comes with a large price. And without overworking the metaphor excessively, it could be a losing move. If we play that card, who knows. Metaphysically, it could be wrong, but it also requires us to ignore everything that brought us to this point, and I mean every person who survived against ridiculous odds since half a million years ago. None of this would matter to me, I enjoyed playing with my mortality, until my daughter came along. Now, life is an obligation, even that option of dying without fear is gone. but rather ironically, it is an even bigger sacrifice to live. But therein lies the truth of my rather wordy correspondence: Life requires meaning. and since true love of self is the requires self realisation, I think you love your ego. but that is not such a trustworthy ally. I guess the only reason to struggle on is because the "option" to do so requires life. and I promise myself not to die as an old man crapping myself in a hospital bed. I am happy with that compromise.
