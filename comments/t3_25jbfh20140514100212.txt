Oh I didn't mean to say I get upset about it. It is just one of those nit picking things that annoy me when I notice it.

Good woman is extremely common here in Ireland, and I just don't understand why they have to change it to girl for me.

And I do realise I'm complaining about people trying to be nice. First world problem or what? :)
