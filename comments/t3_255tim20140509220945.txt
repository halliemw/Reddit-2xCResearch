Having also recently had a IUD placed and knowing the pain of those cramps, there are far worse things you could have said than my uterus hurts.
For instance, "I want to rip out my uterus right now" "My uterus feels like it wants to squeeze right out of me" "My uterus hurts right now and the worst part about it is that every time I get a cramp like this I also bleed a little and I forgot to put on a panty liner this morning"
Also, this may sound weird, but I've started having my boyfriend do raspberries on my pelvis just below my muffin top and it totally stops the cramps. It's totally surprising and totally effective - similar but better than a heat pad.
