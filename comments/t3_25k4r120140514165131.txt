you also said that you never though abortion would be in the cards for you. All I'm saying is that what you thought would be right for you might be different with the new reality you're facing. None of the choices in front of you are easy ones. Take some time talk with those closest to you. Gather whatever support you need. You'll know what's right in the end and no one else can know that. Take some quiet time to yourself to listen deeply to the still small voice within and you'll then know whatever choice you make it's the right one for you and that's all that matters
