I went to Catholic school and we had a similar issue. I have found that the internet is a much more useful place for sex-ed.
Top recommendations of mine are: [Laci Green](http://youtube.com/user/lacigreen), [Hannah Witton](http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9F1F564D609CBD67), and [Sexplainations](http://www.youtube.com/user/sexplanations)

I understand that most of you are probably educated on the topic, but I think it is good to spread these kinds of things.
