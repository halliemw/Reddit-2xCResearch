I saw in one of your other posts the concern of having children and passing it on, from what my doctor told me you can get your eggs removed and checked to make sure they don't carry it. I always thought I wouldn't because I don't want them to deal with this, but being able to know if they will/won't its awesome! 

The one way I deal with having to get my breasts removed is just think that they are one day going to try to kill me so I don't want them on me. I never really cared about them, I try to look on the positive and say hey I get a free boob job and no one can say shit about it! You have to turn the really shit situation into something positive! 

As one of the people posted up top check out force and they have meets and a message board all the women are very helpful and kind!
