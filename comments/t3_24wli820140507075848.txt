To be honest, I don't think those messages were that bad within the context that they were said. Much of what you say is simply not true. They did apologise, and they never told anyone to 'F off'. They told a few people that if they didn't appreciate the types of posts that BM made, they should probably unfollow the FB page. I think the first 12 hrs or so were a knee-jerk reaction in defence of their poster, and then they wizened up and did the right thing when it comes to customer service - posted a proper apology admitting fault.  
When it comes to companies, I don't have any issues with them - I have never seen anyone complain about their returns/customer service before today, and have in fact heard much praise. They post customer pics, showing women of all sizes and body shapes in their products. They are very socially interactive with their customer base. I think this whole thing was just a brain fart on the part of BM management.   
Problem being, I think a large portion of the community(or perhaps just the more vocal ones?) love picking up their pitchforks. I am in a few of the fb bm groups, and the absolute ridiculous things they complain and rant about would blow your mind.   
Not saying that this is all the bm community's fault either. Just that BM brain fart + explosive community = social media nightmare.
