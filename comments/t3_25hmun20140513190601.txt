I've seen "privilegesplaining" used as a more general term to cover any time someone from a privileged status explains the life experiences of someone not in a privileged status to them, or [assumes that that person cannot be a reliable source](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/08/problem-men-explaining-things-rebecca-solnit). In that regard, if a woman was in a privileged status over a man, then you could have womansplaining.
