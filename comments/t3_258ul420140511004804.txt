We had a similar abstinence talk in 7th or 8th grade, and the speaker used velcro gloves... I don't think the point was that they lost their stickiness, just that they made a terrible ripping sound when they pulled apart (i.e., it hurts to break up with someone you had sex with). But he did compare virginity to a gift, and once you give your "gift" away, you can't get it back. What I did really respect about his talk, though, was that he made a point of saying that if someone takes your "gift," you haven't really lost it. So at least some abstinence speakers will acknowledge that rape and molestation don't take away your worth.
