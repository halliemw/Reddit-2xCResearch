My mother, while extremely controlling , didn't go as far as OPs father did in terms of violence. I felt that the only action that I needed to take was simply removing myself from the situation. I went with my SO and a friend to get my things while she was there, and while quite uncomfortable, I never felt like I was in any danger at that point. Even now our relationship can be inconsistent, but I'm always free to come back to my own space now. She probably wouldn't be willing to have any relationship with me had I called her in for DV, but as I said, I didn't feel the need to do anything other than remove myself.
