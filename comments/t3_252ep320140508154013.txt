I was 13 and in the middle of French class when I got mine. I instantly knew what it was so I was pretty excited. When I got to the bathroom I was disappointed that it was brownish red instead of red. I didn't tell my mom for a long time because I was kinda unsure that it was my period because it wasn't red, but when I did I also had to go tell my dad. I was so embarrassed, but he was so excited for me that I ended up becoming really comfortable about it. I think every dad should react like this because it actually made us so much closer to each other. 

I should clarify that I was so excited because I didn't know that cramping would feel like I was dying (I have a tilted uterus which makes the pain almost unbearable) and because I thought that meant I was going to grow boobs soon. It's been 11 years and I'm still waiting...
