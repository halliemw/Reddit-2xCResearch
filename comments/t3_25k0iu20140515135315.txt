For me, the problem would be the pamphlet on abstinence. The medical stuff is fine, by all means advise on methods of protection and the consequences. 

However, to suggest that you shouldn't be having sex at all, that just doesn't sit right with me. I live in the U.K. and I've never had any medical professional tell me not to have sex, because it's a healthy, normal thing to do, as long as you're adequately protected.
