If you ask me, a good female character can be almost anything. She can be strong, or a coward, or emotional, or stoic, or needy, or independent, and still be a legitimate person and interesting character. As long as she's defined by her own characteristics, and not solely by the needs or actions of other characters. As long as she's a person, rather than just a prop.
