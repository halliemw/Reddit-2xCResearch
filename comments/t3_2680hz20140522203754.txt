Hmm I was going to suggest wearing a ring to avoid getting hit on but I guess that doesn't work too well.  Still might be worth a try though; it could help a bit.  

In response to OP's example with the guy texting her, it probably would've been best to not contact him at all.  He gave her his number with the intent of dating or at least sex, I wouldn't have expected the possibility of friendship.
