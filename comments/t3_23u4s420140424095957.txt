I would just stay optimistic until you know for sure.  If you don't get asked to return for further interviews, apply yourself to another opportunity.  Expectation management, my dear!  You aren't always going to nail the interview.  You sound very capable, though, and I think that with a little more practice you will impress someone who will be willing to give you a great job.  Keep your head up and good luck! :)
