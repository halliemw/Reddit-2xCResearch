Not always true... I have similar straight/fine/thin hair (though I let it grow longish and keep a brush with me so it doesn't get too stringy) and I got a perm a few years back. They had to double the amount of ...stuff(?) they put in for double the usual time and the perm fell out well within 2 weeks. I was back to straight hair. 

I feel your pain.
