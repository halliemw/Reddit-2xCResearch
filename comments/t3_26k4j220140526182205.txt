I just wanted to correct some facts, I hope that isnt inappropriate. 

At 5'4 and 120 lbs, you would have a BMI of 20.6, which is considered to be in the normal range, not underweight. At 5'4 and 150 lbs, you'd have a BMI of 25.7, which is just slightly into the overweight range. [Obviously there are various critiques of BMI.]

Check out the [body gallery](http://www.mybodygallery.com/) - you can enter your height and weight. There are some very attractive ladies who are 5'4 and 150 lbs.
