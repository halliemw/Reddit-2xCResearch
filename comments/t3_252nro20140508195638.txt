> It's ok, that's what a real human being looks like

Right, that's all I'm saying. Saying you look sickly would mean that there's something inherently wrong with your face as it is. Whether your complexion is grayish or porcelain or blackberry, it's your skin own tone. 

>I feel more confident when I'm wearing some foundation and eye liner. Also, I feel like saying one look is better than the other isn't very feminist or empowering. 

These two sentences directly contradict each other. If you mean I was saying one was better than the other, I didn't. You're the one drawing the sickly bare/better makeup parallel.

Wear makeup if you like, or don't, or do sometimes but not others, but your face only looks 'sickly' in comparison to what makeup makes you look like. If you never wore it, you wouldn't think you look anything other than totally normal.
