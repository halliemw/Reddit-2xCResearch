You said "Using your beliefs to vote for the person who will force other people to follow said beliefs."  I guess my point was that I don't see having the option to choose abortion as being forced into anything because you have options:  have one, or don't.   But electing representatives who would eliminate that choice DOES force people to follow a specific set of beliefs which the mother may or may not share.  

Regarding non-viable pregnancies:  Some people out there would be happy to elect representatives who would eliminate all abortions except for those that are life threatening for the mother.  There are lots of fetal abnormalities that won't threaten the mother's life but the child, if it lives through birth, will almost certainly die soon after, and those few brief moments of life would be painful.  I'm not a doctor and have no personal experience with these situations but don't believe that currently, in the USA, a woman would not be given the option of abortion in such a situation. *see edit below*  But as you said, in a democracy, we have the right to vote to eliminate this option and that WOULD force people to follow this one set of beliefs--whereas having the option doesn't back anybody into a corner, you can make the best decision for your own situation.

EDITED TO ADD:  [Here](http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf) is a very enlightening guide to the rules on abortions state-by-state.  *41 states prohibit abortions, generally except when necessary to protect the womanâ€™s life or 
health, after a specified point in pregnancy, most often fetal viability.* - so if you find out after the point of viability that your fetus is profoundly malformed, but this is not threatening the mother's life, the mother may not be given the option to abort.
