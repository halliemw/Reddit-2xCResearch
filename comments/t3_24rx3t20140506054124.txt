> I am slightly over 40, and I've been chatting online since the early 1990s. It is only about 5 years ago I started feeling like online culture was getting hostile to women.

I got my first rape threats on Usenet in the mid-90's. I modded a group hierarchy, among with 2 male colleagues, and some guys would bully and threaten me, clumsily edit pictures of me they found, etc. I do agree it's more prevalent now but it has existed before.
