I had a baby, became a single mother when we split up, and later got pregnant when two methods of birth control failed! (Condom and sponge, this should date me a bit.) I was not in a place I could even afford a healthy pregnancy without taking food out of my daughter's mouth, so I decided to terminate the pregnancy. The person I was in a relationship with at the time respected my choice, and helped me out driving me back and forth and going to doctor's visits with me. I went on to have a lovely child (with him!) We've been married over ten years now) and don't regret the decision. 

I had one other time where I used Plan B very shortly after we were married (he knew) when we had an accidental condom break and I was a little worried about possibilities. I just wasn't ready to change our family in two ways so abruptly, since we didn't live together until after the marriage. (Custody agreement, again dating myself.)

Good luck with your decision, personally I think you should let him know, because you're gonna need someone to know where you are and what you're doing just in case something happens like a reaction to the anesthesia or some hithero (really, brain? *Hithero?*) undiagnosed condition crops up- then he might find out at the absolute worst possible time for him to make decisions regarding your care.
