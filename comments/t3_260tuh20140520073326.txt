Yeah, and in my case the 'boys people said were hot' were also the ones that tended to pick on me so it was weird, like I just didn't get it. Still don't, if someone turns out to be an ass it pretty much nixes any potential attraction I have. 

I see, I think that may have been why the online dating approach didn't quite work. Since on that people tend to want to escalate things quickly when at that point I'm more like 'Well, I'd like to get to know the person first actually' 

That's probably part of it, like I can think of traits I like but they can be a bit over the place at least physically, it's like if I find someone attractive I just do.
