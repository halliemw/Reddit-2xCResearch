I started having sharp pains in the first couple weeks after having my mirena put in, and I was super worried because I did NOT want to have it removed because until then I has no problems. I went to the doctor and they did an ultrasound and the pain ended up being a cyst that occurred because basically my ovaries were kinda freaking out for the first month after going off of hormonal birth control pills. But the IUD itself was totally fine and the cyst went away and I've had no problems since that, my body just needed to settle down.
