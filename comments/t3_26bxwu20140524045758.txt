You realize it's that stupid mentality that continues these actions? The whole "men will be men and want to have sex always" or "she was asking for it with what she was wearing" arguments are huge loads of shit, and that's what you're advocating. You're defending that. This is a woman who was walking down the street and was harassed by multiple men; that's disgusting. Why don't you address that instead of attacking OP?
