I don't know yet, I just know that I'm almost at 5 years with my current SO and we've had a rocky road. I don't know for sure that I would want to marry him if he asked tomorrow, and I don't know if I'll ever know. Hearing so many stories from people who just *knew* makes me think it'll never work out for me. 

I was engaged to someone who I absolutely *knew* I was meant to be with, and it was a highly abusive relationship that I'm much better for being out of.
