I've been studying for one exam for the majority of the last 2 weeks, and it's tomorrow.  I'll be lucky if I can get about 50% on it.  Luckily, in this class, a 50 is about average.  It's just so demoralizing.  And I've got another exam Thursday that I haven't started studying for because of the first one.
