Ugh! It makes me so mad to hear that your counselor said that! In case you decide you want to find a better counselor, I just wanted to let you know that there are counselors who specialize in domestic violence. You can usually find them through your local dv hotline or dv shelter. And a lot of places have support groups for people in your situation. It can be so nice to meet others who've been there! 


Also wanted to say that I admire your strength in getting out of that situation.  Thank you for sharing your story.
