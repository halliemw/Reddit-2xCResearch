I don't think that's the case. I mean in this particular example his family also thought a discussion should've happened before the cat was bought. I find it bizarre that the first reaction a lot of the people here is "give the cat away", like it's some kind of disposable plant. owning a pet is a lot of responsibility. for someone who doesn't want kids like myself, a pet is the closest thing to a kid I'll ever have. It's not something I take lightly. 


I mean obviously the conversation didn't happen like "oh thanks. but talk to me next time."
