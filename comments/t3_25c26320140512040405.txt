To be honest I'm not pro-feminism in the "we are equal" kind of way. I'm not a man. I don't want to be treated as one. I'm just against being treated as inferior because I'm a woman. That being said, it was not something you planned or premeditated, it just happened and well, it worked out for you. It's not something to feel proud of but not embarrassed either. If your work is actually worth your raise, you have nothing to be ashamed of.
