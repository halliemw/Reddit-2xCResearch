Switching from soda/ juice to water can lead to this exact thing.  All that soda can make you bloat and make you look heavier. 

The pill obviously can mess with your hormones a bit. As well as if you're using the same scale at the same time of day. I never grew up with a scale, but when my sister came home from school she had hers (I'd step on it every time I walked by just because) and my weight could fluctuate up to 4lbs in a day. So you never know.
