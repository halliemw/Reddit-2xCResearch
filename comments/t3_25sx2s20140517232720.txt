I know what the word means, thanks.

Sorry, but that's just what academia does, it's not an internet theme you're seeing but it has it's roots in the epistemological discussions of academia that's overflowed on to the internet. People like having these discussions, that's why they keep happening.

Since there's no single meaning for a word, so there is no way to simply claim a word as a constant. Like a tree, it has it's roots but is has many branches.
