I was just trying to point out that getting good grades in a class doesn't necessarily mean high aptitude in a subject. Girls aren't exactly filling up USAMO or USAPho even though they're both only based on a test. People who earn good grades should definitely feel good about themselves, and I'm sure many are very smart. But the success of girls is suspect when they consistently do worse on tests yet somehow still end up with higher grades.
