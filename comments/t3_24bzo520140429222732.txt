I don't think high school grades are a very good indicator of knowledge. Yes an A student is almost always better than a D student but there's a lot more going on with grades than tests. Girls probably do homework, participate, and build relationships (or kissup) more than boys do. A guy with a 100 test average that's incredible at physics but doesn't do homework and sleeps in class will most likely get a worse grade than a girl with a 90 test average who does all her homework and tries really hard in class. In my experience girls are better students but guys are more knowledgeable. Grades are a fickle thing.
