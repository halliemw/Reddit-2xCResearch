I have this (actually, something like 40% of people do to varying degrees) and there are a few things you can do to treat it. I like to use Amlactin or Lac-Hydrin as an all over body lotion. They both have lactic acid which helps soothe skin, as well as helps skin to exfoliate and are specifically designed for KP and related conditions. The only downside to them is that they're not cures, so you have to keep using the lotion to keep the KP at bay. A dermatologist might have other suggestions for something more long-term.
