I met a gentleman on a networking website who thought he had a way with women.  We actually exchanged a few messages before he got creepy.  

He was convinced that if I went to dinner with him I would want to "drink his piss for dessert."  Mind you, I'm not trying to diss on someone's legitimate sexual fetish, but I demurred because I wasn't interested in doing that with someone on the first date, if at all.  So he kept saying things like, "Yeah, we'll go wherever you like... and then you'll drink my piss."  That was the creepiest come-on I've ever heard.

The follow-up is that when I wouldn't agree to that activity and kept refusing to commit to a date because of his behavior he sent me a scathing, horribly-spelled follow-up message about how I couldn't be bothered to "roll my sausage fingers across the keyboard to reply" and how I had probably "shacked back up with my loser ex."  That message was somewhat long and contained more charming insults.  I'm sure it's still in my inbox somewhere, but needless to say he got blocked.  

I feel bad for even continuing the conversation once it got too weird.  It's definitely not like getting cat-called in the street because I didn't just duck my head and try to ignore him the first time it happened.  Stupid me, thinking that someone might respect my wishes when I tell them I'm not interested in something!
