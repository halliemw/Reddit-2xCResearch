The older I get, the more often I have to pluck hairs from my chin, face, *ahem* nipple area. :(

It's like every few months a new few new hairs sprout up somewhere in appropriate. 

On the plus side, it feels really good to yank a hair out of your chin with just your finger tips. A little mini sense of accomplishment!
