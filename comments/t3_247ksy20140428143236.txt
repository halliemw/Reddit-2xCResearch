Seems like it could almost be misinterpreted to just send a card or present in this situation. Are you close enough to maybe go to lunch or dinner and treat it as a girls day?  I am always iffy about even saying happy Mother's Day to people (even if she is a step-mom) just because you never know who could be struggling with infertility or desire to be child free and be offended.
