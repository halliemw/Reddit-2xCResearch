You can't "make" misogyny work, that's why this is a horrible idea -- it just makes 2xc a target for the vitriol that already permeates the rest of Reddit. Women are here because they want to stay away from it! Inviting hateful and/or ignorant types in for a cup of tea isn't going to humanize them, it actively degrades this space supposedly for women by forcing every rando that signs up for Reddit into subscribing.
