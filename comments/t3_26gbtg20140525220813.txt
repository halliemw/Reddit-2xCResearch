I think that's an extremely simplistic way of looking at it. I've tried hanging out with him because we were friends for 4 years before dating for 1.5 years, and I wanted that friendship back. I've had sex with him - in the enthusiastic way, back when we were FWB - both because I missed having sex and because I had feelings for him still. I called off that arrangement because the feelings were one-sided and I didn't want to keep putting myself in that position. Since then, I've been badgered many, many times each time we've tried hanging out, and I've caved out of guilt/thinking saying no would end my attempts at being a friend/low-self esteem etc.
