I'm 21 and never had them pierced. When I was younger I really wanted them done, but my mom wanted me to wait. When I got old enough to make the decision for myself, I decided I really didn't want them pierced. 

I have tiny ears and even smaller earlobes, so I'm guessing that most earrings would just look over-sized on me anyway.
