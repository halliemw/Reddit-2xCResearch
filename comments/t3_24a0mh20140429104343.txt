This makes me SO furious. I'm studying to be a nurse. I'm working hard and can barely afford it and incompetent idiots like these nurses are wasting their education and effort. SHE'S HEAVILY SEDATED IN THE ICU!!! WHY would they let him in, against hospital policy and the mother's orders? "Hmm..these rules MUST be in place for a reason! Nah, go ahead in! And shut the door!"


Honestly. And WHY would he think it's okay to just hop on and have sex with her when she's in and out of consciousness? "Hey baby, wake up! No? Okay, let me just pull up your gown like so, move these pesky cords, annnnnnddddd....there we go!" Makes. Me. Furious. He deserves those charges- she was unable to consent and he was trespassing. If someone did that to me or my child, I'd be on a bloody rampage. These days, I don't understand hospitals, nurses, or some men/some people. They're liable. Burn that hospital, fire the administration and ICU ward, and start over.

End rant. Sorry - I'm beyond disgusted.

Edit: To SOME MEN/SOME PEOPLE. Sorry, I got off of work and am now at school without sleep and do my anger at this article was explosive. Sorry if anyone was offended.
