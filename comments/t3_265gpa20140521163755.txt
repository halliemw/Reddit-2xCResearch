As a non shut-in, it feels super awkward and tense if you realize your roommate is running to their room, scurries out of the kitchen as soon as you arrive, and makes sure to take the back door out if you have friends hanging out in the living room.

Not sure if you meant that you're that kind of shut-in, but, for me that's why.
