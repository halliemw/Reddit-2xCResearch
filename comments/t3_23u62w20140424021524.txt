Hi OP, welcome to the great white north! Have you considered working through your traumas with a social worker/psychologist/psychiatrist? Your innate fear of doctors is understandable, but unfortunately it sounds like it is also damaging. I wouldn't want to give you any trouble for not going, because that would just be counterproductive and cruel. 

However, I do urge you to keep looking and start working on your mental health. I wouldn't be worrying that there's anything wrong with you, but when you do feel ready you should go. Start setting small goals for yourself. You don't have to jump right in with a full physical either. You could go and meet the doctor, get your blood pressure taken and all that first and then decide if you're ready to continue at another appointment. It's great that you don't have a family history but unfortunately the vast majority of cancers (90%) are spontaneous. With that said, they also mostly happen in the elderly so don't freak out. Catching things early is key though! 

Something else that might help you is that a lot of male GPs are now hiring female nurse practitioners who can perform physicals. That's what I do with my doctor! I see him to talk about my overall health, prescriptions and my mental health progress. I then make an appointment with the NP for physicals (about every two years I think they recommend, or whenever you're concerned obviously). It made me much more comfortable for my first 'big girl' checkup.
