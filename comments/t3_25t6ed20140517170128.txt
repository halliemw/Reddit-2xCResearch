If you're feeling a little immature you could always spend the week cockblocking him. Tell him you want to go with him to meet his friend (in a totally innocent way) and call him if he goes somewhere without you.

Realistically though there's not much you can do. Go and be awkward, confront him, or stay home. He probably knows your mom figured it out.
