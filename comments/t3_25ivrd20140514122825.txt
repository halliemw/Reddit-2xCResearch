>  It's like they take these ideas and apply them to other people and not themselves...

This is a big thing for me with this essay. This gentleman is obviously wrong and has some real problems, but when I read it I thought some of his thinking and writing was on the right track. What really screwed him up in my reading was the part where he applied all these concepts of kindness and respect of others to everyone outside of himself. 

People should be better to others, but if you're waiting on everyone around you to treat you in the ideal way before you take that leap yourself, you're making it so you never have to grow because you already have an excuse. Her cutting you off doesn't excuse you ignoring her requests repeatedly. A childhood of abuse might help explain but certainly doesn't excuse one's later abuse of others. At some point, we all have to be the bigger person because we will all be hurt by others.
