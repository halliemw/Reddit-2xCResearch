Thanks! I've interviewed people before, and I think it can be easy to forget what it's like to be in the candidate's position. I think my interviewers understood that I was nervous, but it was still up to me to sell myself to them. I still have my fingers crossed. I'll find out if they want to move forward tomorrow.
