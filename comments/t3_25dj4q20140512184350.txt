This is an example of the kind of problems that arise with any rights/equality movement. People go overboard in accepting aspects of the culture that are not appropriate when you are attempting equality.

More than a decade ago, homosexuals often could not be picky if they wanted to be who they are. The need for subtlety and the limited interactions with anyone who might consider homosexual relations forced them to be very vigilant about seizing an opportunity when it arrises, often ignoring moral or ethical concerns. It wasn't right then either, but much like a starving person cannibalizing a dead corpse to survive it was understandable and eventually part of popular gay culture.

The problem with the rights movement is that people confuse these aspects of the culture with part of their identity when it is not acceptable nor correct. Now that people can be more open it's no longer about survival it's about tradition, and one that is wrong.

The same kind of thing happened with both the black rights movement and the feminist movement, and people are quick with labels like misogynist, racist and homophobe, but when your goal is equal RIGHTS you need to keep that in mind. It is not right for a gay man to hit on a taken boyfriend, nor is it ok for him to grab your ass or boobs purely because he's homosexual.
