Affectionate kink! D/s play, but rather than referring to the sub like they're some disgusting piece of meat, they actually compliment the person. "You look so beautiful like that", "I know you can (difficult sex act), baby. Try harder", etc. Give orgasms. More talking in general during sex beyond "oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck, yeahhhhh". Bleh. 

Sensual. Kink between people who actually like each other, and who care about the other's pleasure would be fantastic.
