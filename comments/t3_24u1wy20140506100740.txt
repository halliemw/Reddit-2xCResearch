Yeah, that's a lot. I think it's important your parents go, but you are not a parent, you are her sister. Attending these events should be a treat for her (and for you), but not something she feels entitled to. You can support her without going every time (once a semester is nice enough). It's also basic that she learn she needs to give you notice.


I'm surprised people are saying you should attend all or most of these events. If you want to thats wonderful, but you're not neglecting your sister by having your own list of things to do. Maybe she'll be disappointed, but she should learn to appreciate people being around rather than demanding attention be paid to her---especially because she has the attention of her parents!
