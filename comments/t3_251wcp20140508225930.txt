Most people have actually been cool when I gender-correct (I go through phases where I do or don't correct; the times I do correct it's because I know we're out there in force and I want other women to know they're not alone), but it might also just be that the place I typically hang out on Reddit is generally pretty accepting and open-minded. I do notice that when someone trolly disagrees with me somewhere near a gender-leak in my comment history, I'll get more menacing and creepy "you don't belong here" type replies.
