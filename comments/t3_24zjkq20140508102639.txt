It IS important, thank you for posting it, it's just sad that it's getting downvotes enough to be near invisible. There's probably a lot of women who won't see this now who would have benefitted from it.

As of now it's only at plus 4 with a whopping 220 downvotes. Gosh **fellas**, what's the problem? Why wouldn't you want abused women to learn more about their partners and their situation?
