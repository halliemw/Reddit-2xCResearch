Ugh that guy sounds like such a creep!  I'm really glad to hear that you don't blame yourself for this - our society can be so awful in attributing blame to victims.  It's horrible how some people feel so entitled to intimate/sexual contact just because someone else seems to have expressed an interest in them.
