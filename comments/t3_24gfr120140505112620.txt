I know *about* the Illuminati, in the sense that I know some people think there's this secret group of powerful rich people pulling the strings and keeping everyone else down.

I don't know that there *is* an Illuminati, though. 

That's the difference between knowing about something and knowing something. There are a lot of jokes that are funny if you know women are [insert misogynistic statement here] but aren't funny if you just know that some people think [misogynistic statement].

Whether or not you think that a meta-joke is a good example of a classic joke for the purposes of this conversation is definitely a matter of opinion, so there didn't seem much point in going further with that.
