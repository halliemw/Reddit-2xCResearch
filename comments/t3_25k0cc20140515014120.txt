I had dental pain come out of nowhere (seemingly of course) after a healthy checkup. My bf has been so kind taking care of me. Today I had my appt (yay my tooth had an extra root hiding that wasn't dealt with during the previous root canal), & I felt like garbage. Bf made dinner for me, & he was so patient as I weakly whined about the pain after the anesthesia wore off.

I know this is a normal thing in relationships & all. But the crappier you feel, the more awesome the good stuff feels. I'm so grateful.
