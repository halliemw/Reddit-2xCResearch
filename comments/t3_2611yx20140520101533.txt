Yikes.  Well, my current boss hates me and she always makes stuff up and says I did it. She doesn't have anything to fire me on, even though I'm sure she would if she could, which is honestly why I'm quitting in June.

When it comes to truly terrible and catty bosses like that, it either takes time (like a year) to warm up in their favor, or you leave.  I put 18 months into this job, and it's only gotten worse, so I'm out.
