Your sarcasm isn't an especially effective way to explain yourself because I have no idea what the scope of your experiences are nor how they even apply to your prior statements. So you somehow know depression. Great for you I guess? 
 
Freedom of speech is not an absolute right, although it is held in very high regard in the U.S. It is a qualified and refined right, "right or wrong." There are reasons why U.S. society has determined, for example, that child pornography is not protected speech, even if a person gets such pictures of a child from a different country entirely. 

In certain cases of online harassment, where the U.S. has jurisdiction over its own citizens, why should a court/jury not be allowed to determine whether such speech is protected, after a specific law is properly written and passed to that effect? This is why laws are created, no? 

Deleting accounts is an option, yes, but there is an argument to be made that such an action restricts another person's freedom of expression. Blocking people is also an option, yes. In some limited circumstances, however, additional legal action may be warranted if allowed.
