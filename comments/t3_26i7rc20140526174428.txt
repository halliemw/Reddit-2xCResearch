It sounds as if the admins are more comfortable dismissing legitimate concerns and harassment on this sub as sensationalized attention seeking than they are listening to the feedback the users of this sub have been giving. I would personally like to see the sub to have more mods to address the legitimate concerns of users on this sub. Yes, there will be false reports, but telling women 'not to worry their pretty little heads' over trolls because they're fake is insulting.
