It has so many prose to it, I go to to a school with uniforms, a few times a day we have days where we can ware whatever we want, most of the girls hate it as they are under pressure to look good and it takes them a lot longer in the morning to get  ready, I really don't understand why so many schools don't use uniforms in the US, they aren't even that expensive.
