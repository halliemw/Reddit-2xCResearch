As far as how to do it, [this](http://ask.metafilter.com/88726/How-do-I-let-someone-down-easy#1305651) advice by Metafilter's Miko is great:

>I was once on the receiving end of a similar "just not that into you" one-sided breakup, and to this day I still say it was the best breakup I ever had. The guy handled it nobly and masterfully and he should give lessons in how to do it. He emphasized a few points which helped it go down easier:

>1. There's certainly nothing wrong with you - we are a great match in a lot of ways - you're smart, attractive, fun to be with, etc (list positive qualities) 
2. But for whatever reason, I'm not feeling strongly enough about this, and I know that it's important to me to have that strong connection by now
3. You deserve real feeling and enthusiasm and for whatever reason I can't deliver it right now.
4. I don't want to be in your way and prevent you experiencing the fabulous life you will soon be living when you are with someone who is ready for you right now, and knowing that's not me I think its' best to free you up
6. I really really really really struggled with this decision because I like you and don't want to hurt you. I didn't make it lightly but I feel sure it's the right thing. 
7. Do you have any questions for me? 

>It's basically "it's not you, it's me," but with lots of cushioning. The trick seems to be: make it clear that the decision isn't negotiable and you're not wishy-washy on it, but also make it clear that there's nothing wrong with them and there's a lot of really great stuff about them. So it's more "it's not you, it's not me, it's just not a fit, and I was able to see that more clearly when I had a few days away to think about us."

It's perfectly okay to just not be that into someone, even if they're theoretically a great fit.
