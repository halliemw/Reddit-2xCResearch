You are facing probably the biggest challenge of your family's life with amazing dignity, grace, and strength. I don't have any specific advice for you as to what would help your wife and kids, but I'm a big believer in hospice care; my advice to you would be to research hospice groups in your area and find one that resonates with you, should use choose that road at the very end. The hospice organization should have resources for your family as well (grief counseling, etc) and can go a long way towards taking some of the worry and responsibility off your wife's shoulders, letting her and your kids just spend time with you in those last weeks/months.
