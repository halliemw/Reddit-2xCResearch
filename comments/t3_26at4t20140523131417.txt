that makes sense. I dunno, ive had female managers before and it feels as if when i am being requested to do a task its like they asking their kids to make their beds. My current boss who is female is awesome with delegation, she doesnt ask. She tells me she needs something done, but not in a tone of voice that she uses when shes talking to a child.
