I'm a short girl here,4'11, 23 yo and about 140 lbs, and reading this makes me feel just less alone about the short women struggles! To build on the clothing issues anyone else have the problem where all normal shirts are inappropriately low-cut and so it's all "HELLO CLEAVAGE"? I seriously only buy pretty bras because I know the whole world and their mother will probably be seeing them. Also it sucks to feel like you're paying an extra cost with every piece of clothing you buy because you have to mod it.

Also losing weight just sucks. When I calculate how many calories a day I should be eating to lose about a pound to two pounds a week, it's like a thousand calories which is functionally starvation, so basically I have to work-out hardcore every day. womp womp.

Finally, carrying things anywhere is the worst, I legitimately trip on things I'm carrying all the time because I either can't get my arms around it or when I'm carrying it's so low to the ground I flat-tire myself. I seriously get the bicep workout of my life carrying my groceries home. So yeah being all sizes comes with their own ups and downs I'm sure, but y'know I only have to live through my own, so it's nice to find people who get it.
