The act is sexual assault regardless of what she thinks. Sexual assault means violating someone's body by touch withiout permission. This happened. 

And it's widely recognized that victims of sexual crimes should not be told what to or pushed to do it (like told she SHOULD go to the police) as this is yet another act of not respecting her choices. Going to te police is not a guarantee of having evidence for the crime and the process can be violating in and of itself.  My attitude to victims of any sexual crime is to support them no matter what they want to do. They are not required to sacrifice their peace of mind for social safety.
