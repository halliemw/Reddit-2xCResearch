I would think its exactly what a "not guilty by reason of insanity" plea would be based on. Not "temporary insanity" just "insanity" - the problem with using this defence is you don't get jail for a defined period if they accept this, you get committed to an asylum indefinitely until the doctors decide you are safe to release. For something like this, that won't be easy and it's entirely possible that you could stay locked up forever
