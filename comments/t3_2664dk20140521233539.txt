A breastfeeding mother should not have to cover up because nursing is not an obsenity. A baby is being fed. And not only do people generally not like eating with a blanket over their face, and bottle fed babies do not have to "cover up," but in a very practical sense some babies don't tolerate a cover at all. 

The fact is nursing without a cover is usually quite discreet and typically doesn't even expose that much skin.
