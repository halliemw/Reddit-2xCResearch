This is a very good point. I knew some girls that were too friendly with their mothers when they were in high school. One girl even did drugs with her mother (smoked weed/took hallucinogenics) which I couldn't imagine doing with *my* mom at all! This woman is, from what I know, not in a great situation now either.
