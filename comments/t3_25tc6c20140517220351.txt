Almost certainly they don't have a degree based on what you've said. The second question

> Was it school rules cited as the reasoning or state law? 

Just meant to ask if them seeming to favor him was based on university policy, or if they were saying that he was legally (not just internal to the university) favored. The former is better for you legally, but the latter isn't a big deal either, since they aren't a jury, lawyers, etc. Don't sweat it either way.

Some schools have a way to access free legal counseling, so you may wish to search online and see if something like that is available. This is likely to be separate from the University's internal conduct/integrity group. You can ask that person for help finding a lawyer, and how to go about it. But be aware that they may act with the university's interests in mind, so don't let them dissuade you from getting outside legal advice.
