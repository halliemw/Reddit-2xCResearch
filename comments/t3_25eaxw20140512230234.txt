A month passed between you expressing your decision to have the abortion and the procedure itself? That's very unlike where I live. The gap is less than a week.  And no counseling was on offer?  

I'm sorry for you, OP. I hope you can find peace with this. If you have access to any kind of decent one-on-one psychological counseling, I hope you'll give it a try (if you aren't already, of course). 

Loss and regret are a natural part of life, it's something many people can relate to. If nothing else I'm glad we're here for you.
