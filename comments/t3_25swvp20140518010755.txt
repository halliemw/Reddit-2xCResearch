If by "ad hominem" you intend to refer to the fallacy that goes by that name, you've misused it.

An ad hominem fallacy occurs when your argument (or position) is judged as being poor in virtue of who you are. As when someone dismisses the arguments about the rightness or wrongness of killing from a convicted murderer, on the basis that they are a convicted murderer. As when someone dismisses arguments about feminism in virtue of the arguments being made by a man.

The fallacy is not committed, as in the case of /u/Nora_Oie's post, when someone judges you based on the argument (or position) you express.

In short, the directionality matters. An ad hominem fallacy goes from person to argument (or position) not from argument (position) to person.

On a separate matter, while I find your general thesis both horrid and flawed, that you have received so many downvotes seems to evidence an intellectual dishonesty (of the downvoters). However horrid and flawed your comments are on, they are on topic and responsive. Your general thesis, moreover, is shared by at least by a significant majority so we who are opposed could be grateful for your articulation of it. In this way your posts are important contributions to the discussion.
