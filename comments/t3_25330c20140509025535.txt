Your not every trans person. I don't know your experiences and if you are trans and have faced that sort of shift treatment in a interview ( and many other crap situations) I'm sorry. It sickens me that there is so little fairness

Edit: just to clarify that top line there cause its eternally vague. I'm just saying that different people will have experienced different things with in that community some may well have had positive interview experiences ( I hope)
