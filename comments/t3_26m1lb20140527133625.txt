I disagree with your example of another context and I don't think that it's as comparable as you claim. In the original tweet you have female on guard from male, or marginalized on guard from privileged; in your example you have privileged on guard from marginalized. If race is comparable (which I don't think it is) you would have something more like, "No, not all whites are racists, but all blacks have to navigate a world where those who are look the same as those who aren't." And I think that is still a valid point, but, I'll say again, a completely different conversation.
