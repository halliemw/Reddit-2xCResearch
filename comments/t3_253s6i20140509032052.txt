My natural tearing with the second birth, despite being catastrophic, healed up faster and easier then the episiotomy I got with the first kid. 

If I hadn't refused an epidural I'm sure I would have ended up with a how did the doctor put it.. a slash and dash?  An emergency c-section. 

I'm a little foggy on the fine details. There was a lot of blood loss. So much that while the baby was cleared to go home the next day, I wasn't. I left that afternoon ama.

I was thankfully at an amazing hospital with an amazing team of doctors.
