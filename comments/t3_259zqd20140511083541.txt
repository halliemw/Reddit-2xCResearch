This is something I struggle with a bit, even if it often feels more like just intrusive thoughts and not just what I think or feel.

What I do which helps me a lot, is take some time to think about who I am, what sort of person I want to be, etc etc. Sometimes I'll even write a little journal about it. No judgement, no comparisons with other, just a raw assessment of my own internal state and values. Treat it almost meditatively.

I don't know why this helps me more than just saying "I have nothing to be bothered by," but it does. Maybe just a bit more detail, a bit more grasp of myself and who I am.
