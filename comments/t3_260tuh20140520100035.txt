Don't worry about any of this.  Meet new people outside your circle, go on dates not to seek a BF but to meet someone new and have a good time.  Continue to see people who you feel like spending more time with and discard the ones you don't.  

online dating really goes as fast as you want.  If your wanting the get to know you phase spend more time talking to them on the phone, even if after the first few dates.  Or choose date locations where it doesn't move past your comfort level, don't go to their house for dinner or movies if your not ready for where that could lead. 

And lastly there is no such thing as the one, everyone person you will meet has flaws, you just have to determine what you feel to be a flaw you can live with and the ones you feel are more than you can handle.  For example I have a lot of girl friends who say they never want to date a cheater, but they are willing to take someone back who they have dated for 5 months who cheated.  Well if you overlook cheating, then a cheater is someone your willing to date.
