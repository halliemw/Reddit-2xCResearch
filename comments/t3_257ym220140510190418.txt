Its not an uncommon reaction, though. I worked over summer as an activities instructor at a farm, and was in charge of taking the groups through rifle shooting. I didn't get any 'cute' comments, but I had a lot of guys who refused to listen to my instructions because they assumed they knew more than me because they bought hunting magazines. 

More often than not, the women shot better, even if they hadn't shot before, because they did everything I told them, rather than trying to show off to their mates.
