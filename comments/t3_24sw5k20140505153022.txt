This isn't your fault, nor is it something you could've stopped. You sound like a wonderful person. This is going to sound unbelievably stupid right now, but *you are going to get over this.* It'll take time, pain and tears but one day you will be over this mess and you're going to find someone who's worth your love. Take all the time you need, spend some quality time with your friends, pamper yourself, wipe the slate clean of him and don't be too hard on yourself. He is a selfish piece of shit who wasn't good enough for you (and that's an understatement). You're worth ten of him.
