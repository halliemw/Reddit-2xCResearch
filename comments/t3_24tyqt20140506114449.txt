It's not really controversial that Hep C can be transmitted sexually.  However, it is fairly hard to transmit, and isn't included in the standard  STI screen.

My sister lived with undiagnosed Hep C through most of her life (from a tainted blood transfusion as an infant, most likely).  You wouldn't BELIEVE the fuss the clinic kicked up when I asked to be tested (we'd gotten into our share of bloody fights as kids, shared razors as teens, etc); you'd think I was asking to be tested for a third eyeball.  They kept on insisting there was no reason to get tested, as Hep C is basically impossible to pass except through shared needles or risky sexual behaviour.
