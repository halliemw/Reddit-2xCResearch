Oh my gosh, what a crazy asshole!  I would do some breathing exercises, try to meditate or relax because it sounds like you're in panic mode and you'll need a clear head to consider your options. 

What you can do now is take an hour to meditate, Google or youtube will have guided ones.   Clear your head honey,  freaking out just causes more problems
