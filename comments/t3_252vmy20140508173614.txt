Hey I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through. 

I was in a relationship and one of the big reasons we broke up was neither of us wanting to make major sacrifices in our careers at the age of 23. There were other reasons too - maybe if our relationship had been great in all other respects we could have given it a try. He stayed for his job, I moved for my PhD.

Now I'm in a relationship with another PhD student, and I could really see myself spending my life with him. Which means that we will most likely have a Two-Body Problem to face again in 3-5 years, and any time one of us changes jobs for the rest of our lives. It's not easy having two people in high-powered jobs in a relationship, and that's a big reason for discrepancies in gender ratios in these kinds of careers.

Just because you don't feel as strongly about your professional goals doesn't mean your goals are also important and worthwhile reasons to make sacrifices for. I don't think you should feel guilty about wanting to get a PhD in a field you love.

I remember thinking "wow I invested a lot of time in this relationship, and I want to have children some day, it will be years before I'm as close to anyone else, how long have I postponed having children because of breaking up?" Maybe you're going through that kind of thing too? 

I think this kind of break-up is really hard to get over, because you can always second guess it, and wonder "what if?" It's not like he was an asshole or had very different views on children than you or something. 

Anyways, I don't really have any advice, but I just wanted to say, I can relate, and I'm happy to chat with you if you need some support :)
