So one article and a lot of armchair psychologists are saying he was "mentally ill," with very little (if any) qualified commentary on exactly how - there are a lot of mental illnesses and disorders out there. 

Saying this happened ONLY because he was !crazy! is not helpful, nor accurate, especially since there are *many* mentally ill people, [even people with a psychotic disorder](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26pkri/would_am_i_the_only_women_whos_not_oppressed_have/chtftks), who harm no one, let alone go on killing sprees.

Focus on what you *know* to be true, not on assumptions.

FWIW, I do not disagree that we should have better focus on mental health in the U.S. I absolutely do.
