So you want to report it to...what...get him in trouble?  Get him kicked off the faculty at 65 years old?

Do you think he's a genuinely bad person, or do you think he's just a product of an older generation who doesn't quite realize he's being inappropriate?

Why do you handle it in a nice, mature, grown-up manner and make an appointment with him to tell him that some of the things he says can come across as demeaning toward women and didn't make you feel great.

That sure sounds like a better approach than possibly ruining his life, just when he is close to retirement.  Do you think he's such a bad person that you want to take actions that could ruin his life?
