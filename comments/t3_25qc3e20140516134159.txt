I run into this a lot. Sidenote: I have to admit I never ever ever button all the way to the top. It gives you this monoboob look that isn't flattering. Opening up the top few buttons (enough for a V shape, not enough for cleavage) is usually a lot more flattering.

*However*, I've found the problem generally persists even if you unbutton the top couple of buttons. Marks & Sparks do pretty good (and affordable) minimiser bras. They're not 'binders' but do redistribute the boobage a bit to help with the button thing. These might work as they can reduce by a cup size, and they're not hideously uncomfortable.

Edit: m&s and Zara both do camis that are 'shaping' i.e. Squish you a bit. This can make the difference if it is an 'almost' shirt.
