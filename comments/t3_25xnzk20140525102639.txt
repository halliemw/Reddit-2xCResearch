I mainly meant everyone should dismiss that section, not just females. The gems are found elsewhere.

Anime is, I agree, much worse probably in most areas regarding sexism, but it's also odd in that they have some great female character driven shows that are also loaded with fanservice. 

I only say that most probably don't actually read the comics because it's just probably true, people like to jump into comic discussions as if they've been fans all their lives when they only started liking superheroes when Raimi made a decent Spider-Man. That's not me being dismissive of females, that's me being dismissive of people who do that kind of stuff. People who watched Dr Who for one season but own the merchandise and spread memes around, or go about how much they love Iron Man when they didn't even know he existed pre-Downey Jr. That kind of stuff. OP surely knows what she's talking about, but people are gonna jump in here talking about the movies and a few covers they've seen without even knowing the first thing about comics.

I'm not a guy jumping in trying to defend men, I'm a comic geek jumping in to defend comics. I'm not going to tell artists not to draw them that way if that's how they want to draw them, and that would be the only realistic solution to the problem other than wait out the cultural shift and get some more females into illustrating comics. 

Sad to hear that about I, Vampire, I was just thinking of trying that out. It's hard to find good vampire fiction that isn't influenced by the Twilight trend of turning into a teen romance.
