Wow, such a gorgeous sari!!  
I got a sundress that used to be my mums when she was a teenager (so its about 35 years old).  When I was growing up, it used to be my favourite outfit on her.  Its a little threadbare, has a few random paint stains and needs a bit of TLC, but its one of my favourite dresses. Every time I wear it I think of her and smile.
