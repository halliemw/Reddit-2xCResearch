We were reminiscing at work today about a man who physically attacked two co-workers, not over a break-up, but over a difference of opinion.  This was 20 years ago.  It took awhile to get him fired/retired (I think he decided to retire early).  The number of people (men and women) in the room who had had him go all Combat on them was rather large (as in, all the people in the room who had met him).

It was a woman who finally was encouraged to pursue a case against him (the management wanted him out, they coaxed her into reporting his behavior - he injured her while trying to grab a male coworker by the throat).  I don't think she's ever really gotten over all the feelings involved in that year long investigation.  

In this case, several people refused to agree with the man, and that set him off.
