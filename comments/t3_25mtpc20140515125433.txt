Yes. Much MUCH safer. UV light definitively causes skin cancer. Mystic only really impacts dead skin, so it doesn't penetrate deeply enough into your body to cause cancer. 

Just don't inhale it while you're in there. It only lasts about 10 seconds, so you shouldn't have a problem holding your breath that long.
