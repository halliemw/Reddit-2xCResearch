My SO of almost 6 years won't touch me if I am intoxicated. Not even if I tell him before I drink that I will want sex later. He just says "you're too drunk, let's see how you feel in the morning" if I smoke he just tells me its time for bed now and cuddles me to sleep. I want sloppy drunk sex at least once, just to say I had it, but he says it feels like he is taking advantage of me.
