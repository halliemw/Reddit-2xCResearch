Definitely tell your professors - all of them. (Your grades shouldn't have to suffer!) And tell your academic advisor so they know what's going on. Professors are a lot nicer and understanding than you think.  
At my school, if you're going through a rough patch, a professor can give you an "incomplete," you come back next semester when you're doing better, take your final, and then life goes back to normal. See if your school has a similar option.
