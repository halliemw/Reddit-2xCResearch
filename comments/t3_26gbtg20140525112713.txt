Coercive sex?

There's a lot of disagreement over how to classify this sort of thing.  The trouble with sexual coercion is that it's hard to really define in specific and objective terms. Does any pressure at all constitute coercion? Because no decision is ever made completely free of any outside pressure or influence. What if two people are in a long-term relationship and the lack of sex is making one of them unhappy? Are they not allowed to discuss this with their partner? If they do, they're surely putting some amount of pressure on that partner to have sex more often, but what's the alternative? Should they just up and stop returning their partner's calls one day? Just walk out and never say why?

Sexual coercion can be more clear cut. Like someone who badgers their partner relentlessly until they finally give in. But it can also be more morally ambiguous. Like someone who genuinely feels rejected when turned down for sex, and shows it in a way that makes their partner feel guilty.

I do think that coercion can be morally rape, but only if involves some deliberate attempt to create an unreasonable amount of pressure on your partner. Some behaviors can create unintentional pressure (like doing something nice for your partner and having that cause them to feel like they owe you), and other behaviors can create pressure as a by-product of something done for a more legitimate reason (like discussing your unhappiness with the lack of sex in your relationship). Basically, it's hard to draw an objective line, and criminalizing it would be very difficult for that reason.
