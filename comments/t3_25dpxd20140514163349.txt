I got my IUD inserted on Monday (the 12th). I've never been pregnant before and I was on my period. BUT THAT HURT. 

My doctor was talking to me between measuring my cervix and the actual insertion and telling me that it feels a lot like a contraction, as she's had both a child and an IUD. I didn't say it out loud, but I remembering thinking "HOLY SHIT. If that's what a contraction feels like I am NEVER having a baby. Just take my uterus out now!"

I had taken 4 ibuprofen (800mg) and an Ativan. That fucking hurt. And I wanted to pass out. I practice Mindfulness and applied breathing techniques to ease the pain of the insertion.
