I can see where you are coming from, but have you considered that most dress codes don't necessarily address tight or revealing outfits for men because men tend to not wear them? Also, that this is partially because general dress codes and society at large already expects and often makes men to wear more layers? 

This could be leading to why men are not directly addressed as having to "cover up" because they might distract women, or do you believe women do not and would not be distracted by attractive men in revealing or tight clothing? 

Therefore it might be dealing with human sexuality by addressing the main symptom, due to current trends, while also enforcing equal standards, as I'm sure the males would also not be allowed to wear such short, tight, or revealing clothing?
