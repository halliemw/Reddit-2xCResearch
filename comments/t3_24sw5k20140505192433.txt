I understand. When my marriage ended a year ago, I was convinced everything ever had been my fault, even though there had been signs things were as much him as they were me. It's taken me months, but I'm finally at a place where I can look back and say "Yeah, I may have been wrong about him, but I knew I was. Next time, I'll trust my instincts." and move forward. It's not easy, but you'll get there. I started a blog I keep private just to help me work through it all. Feel free to message me if you want to talk.
