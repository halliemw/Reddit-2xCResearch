Usually I just change mine, but if i know I'm stuck without a new one for a bit and I really have to go, I do this: Wet your finger a bit from the sink or your saliva and make the end of the string a bit wet, then gently pull string up and tuck between folds. The moisture will let it cling to your skin a bit but will usually dry by the time you're done. Avoid running it in front of your urethra in case you pee and push the string out.
