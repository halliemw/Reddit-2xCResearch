That moment is terrifying!!!!! Thanks for the comradery. When my results came up negative I really didn't believe the result. And I already had a whole plan of action if it was positive. For the negative result I was all, "Huh? What now?" since I was so convinced I was preggo. But thankfully, my period has decided to start SIX days late! It is most definitely a good lesson for me. Whewwwwwwwwww.
