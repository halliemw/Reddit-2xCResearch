Remind yourself that the discomfort you are feeling is temporary. The first thing you should do is find a place to live with roommates. Ask some friends/check craigslist, etc. Once you have that in place, start looking for a job. Don't be so picky on the job, as you can trade up. You will feel much more comfortable once you start bringing in enough money to pay your bills. The next couple months will be hard, but you can do it and it will only get easier as these pieces fall into place. Maybe you can try reaching out to some of your old friends. It may seem awkward, but it doesn't hurt to try and might help take your mind off him. Good luck.
