Jobs with intense hours are very heavily biased towards men in almost all cases.  Law, investment banking, surgery, culinary.  Culinary jobs (that aren't personal chef and perhaps catering in some cases) are an odd duck on that list- they have both low pay and 80+ hour weeks.  You'd think that putting in twice full-time would merit significant pay, but that's just not how things go in the restaurant kitchen.

Since women tend to prefer jobs with life balance these jobs tend to be avoided by women and once a strong gender bias exists it becomes entrenched, be it women in nursing or men in the restaurant kitchen.  Add in the fact that there is little prestige and pay to balance the lifestyle issues and you have a place that doesn't have much draw.
