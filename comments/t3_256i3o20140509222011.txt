Offer to look after a niece or nephew for a little while. That will give you a good idea of whether caring for kids is something you enjoy or want to do 24/7. Try an afternoon, take them to the zoo or something. If that goes well, arrange a weekend stay.

Me, I'm looking forward to being the cool aunt when my nieces and nephews are old enough to be interesting.
