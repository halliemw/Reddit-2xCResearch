I had the same first thought that there could be something else going on. It's one thing to be freaked out and withdrawn as you realize how people are starting to look at you, but the clinging to her uncle's arm and suddenly needing to leave and go home make her sound like she was really panicked. Of course, I hope I'm wrong, but it makes me worry that she's getting harassed by someone in particular, or, god forbid, is recalling a traumatic experience.
In either case, the advice above is good. I would start a conversation with her, emphasize that none of this is her fault, and look into self defense classes. But also make sure she knows that you can help, if there is a bigger problem.
