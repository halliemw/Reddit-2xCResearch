I have an alternate suggestion for your network. Part of the problem with a safe list, is that it can be scammed in either direction. That is you could have women set up fake safe houses, but you could also have anti-abortion activists browse the network and attack the safe houses as well.

A third option might be to set up another safe contact. So if a women needs to visit a clinic in a particular city, match her with both a safe home and a safe contact for both. If either the women holding safe house or the women seeking medical care has an issue, they can reach out to the third women for help.

You could also make a rule about that both parties must contact the third person during the visit and after the visit. That way if something is wrong the third women can immediately contact the police with the relevant details.
