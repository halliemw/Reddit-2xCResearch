Yes, but there's a difference between irritatingly arbitrary and blatant gender discrimination.  

I have fine blonde hair and I find it to be obnoxiously high maintenance.  It doesn't hold clips or styles well, everything just falls out after a little bit because it's too slippery.  My boyfriend is in the army and all he has to do is buzz it every couple of weeks, it takes 5 minutes and he's set for quite awhile.  Women should at least have that option!
