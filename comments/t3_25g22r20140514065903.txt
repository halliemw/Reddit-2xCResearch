Yes, it's exposure to estrogen that has been shown to increase the odds of developing breast or ovarian cancer. You're not exposed to that hormone (or at least in smaller quantities) during pregnancy or lactation. I believe every year of breastfeeding equals ~4% less chance of developing breast cancer over your lifetime.
