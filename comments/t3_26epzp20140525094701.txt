And they're gendered BEFORE they day they're born (see: setting up a pink room for a girl, blue for boy). So unless you can raise a baby in a situation where absolutely no one is gendering them you can't really say shit about whether or not they're being influenced to buy what society tells them is for them and avoid what society tells them is not for them. Blue/pink aisles are in depth marketing strategies, pretending they have no affect is being deliberately obtuse.
