I probably shouldn't give out the details online because I don't want to be arrested, so I prolly shoulda kept my mouth shut. Let's just say I actively misrepresented some things in order for everything to go smoothly, and sorta kinda perjured myself and committed fraud. A tinsy bit. For like, really good reasons.

Let's just say hypothetically in order for the abortion to be free (instead of literally thousands of dollars) certain things needed to be in place, and the person who needed the abortion did not qualify for it to be covered. Though, hypothetically, they would have one month (just one!) later, but at that point it would have been too far into the pregnancy and we would need to go to a different clinic where it wouldn't be free anyway.

So I, hypothetically, just sped things along a bit through deceit and identity fraud. I was pretty reckless in my teens but honestly I'd do it all over agains. Hypothetically.

Edit:
Dear Downvoters: much love, I know your hearts are in the right places, like with insurance companies instead of scared, unprepared, and poor young adults. :)
