The OG comment is deleted, so I have no idea what you are responding to, but as someone who has two parents with extensive training in karate, one of which taught me, over years, different self-defense techniques, this on top of a few quarters of in-class self-defense and karate classes myself ... in a real situation you can almost be guaranteed to toss all of that out the window.

After all of that I was still thrown around a man's house for 45 minutes, shocked, dazed, confused, completely helpless, and nowhere near strong enough to defend myself. Additionally, he was so drunk that anything I did try to do had absolutely no effect.

Yes, it is good to train girls to not get raped, better to just be able to defend themselves, avoid those situations as best they can, recognize when things are about go south, etc., and it is even better to train boys to not rape. To understand from an early age what consent means, in ALL circumstances, and to shed the "boys will be boys" mentality that so many young men are being raised in.

However, not being trained in self-defense does not automatically equal "just taking it like a good girl." Especially considering that no amount of physical training can prepare you for the mental shock of actually being attacked.
