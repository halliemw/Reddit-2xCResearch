Absolutely, and I understand the sentiment.  My advice was more about what to do if you find yourself in the situation again, but I can understand how sensitive a topic it is, loaded with all kinds of connotations that could be inferred even if not implied.

I've been on a metacognition kick lately, trying to teach teenagers how to think about their patterns of behavior to better equip them with identifying and improving negative habits.  I should have gone more in depth in my comment, and not leave so much room for interpretation.  I'm sorry you've had to deal with it, too.  Its frighteningly common.
