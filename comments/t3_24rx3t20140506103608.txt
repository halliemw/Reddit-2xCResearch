>The definition of "feminism" you provided was as similarly terse as that which I provided, so if there is some problem with the provision of terse definitions it applies just as much to yours.

It's not the brevity of the definition you provided that I complained about. The definition you provided was simply lacking important details, just as the definition of the republican party was lacking important details. An omission in a definition does not mean what is omitted is not true.

>Right, so you do acknowledge this understanding that was different to the one you initially provided.

It *was* different. In the past. Tense is important. 

> Feminism ***IS*** about the advancement of women.

vs

> Feminism ***USED TO BE*** about ending the differences in rights (achieving equality) between the sexes.

See the difference?

>Conceptually, yes, but you do also accept that feminism was the first movement to care about gender equality?

I do accept it, but I don't see its relevance.

Do you accept that things change? It is not uncommon for any organization of people to stray from their original intent when they become mainstream or achieve some sort of power, be it political or otherwise. That is what I am saying has happened here.

>Loud voices carry the meaning of a movement in the mind of those that wrongly generalise from those minority loud voices to the whole movement.

Are you British?

So, you think it's wrong to generalize conservatives based on what Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, Todd Akin, and Sarah Palin have said?

>One, don't generalise from the loud voices to the whole group.

How can I not?

>Two, denounce views from those that identify as feminists that say sexist or male deprecating things as not being feminists.

And when I do that, I get downvoted into oblivion among feminists. Feminists, as with most groups, generally push away anything they think they might disagree with.

>Three, don't blindly accept what is evidently a lazy list of quotes generally taken out of context, misquoted, or entirely fabricated that do not represent the author's intent. Instead, attribute the quote to a source that we can, at least in principle, verify for ourselves.

The two works of fiction you mentioned are actual books with those quotes. How can feminism in one hand denounce violence against women in books, tv, and movies as perpetuating rape culture and in the other hand write things against men and say "it's just fiction"?

Also, the clarification of the David Angier quote doesn't make it any better. If someone files a false report, that is a crime. Period. If that report removes someone else's freedom even for a short time, that is an egregious crime against that person. Using the possibility that people might not report legitimate crimes because false reports are prosecuted is offensive at the very least and is tantamount to a criminal act in and of itself.
