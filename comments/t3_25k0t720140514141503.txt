I didn't think IUD's were scary when I went to high school, but after reading some of the stories... Some about the tremendous pain, another about a girl who had a hormonal IUD placed in, and had a sudden surge of emotions that basically made her crazy until she raced herself to the doctor in hysterics to have it taken out.

Also, someone I know had a lung embolism which was supposedly caused by the nuvaring she used.
