Periods are all pretty crazy different. Mine used to be 7 days of straight bleeding when I was a teenager. Now several years later, they've become a few days of heavy bleeding then like one day of light bleeding and then some spotting. I was on bc for awhile there, but I'm not sure if that's what caused the change or if it was just part of how my body is doing things now.
