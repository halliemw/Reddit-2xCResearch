My first and only experience with XBox chatting was when the first XBox  had just come out, and my best friend's brother got one and had a headset. I was twelve and was really into video games, and her brother let me try it out. I don't even remember what game I was playing, but it was moderately violent. (I was already an old hand at violent games because my Dad gave me Turok: Dinosaur Hunter when I was seven. OH, DAD.) 

Some guy said something about how girls wouldn't like this game, and I said, "Well, I like it and I'm a girl," which was apparently like having a badge on your chest that says "PLEASE ASK ME ABOUT MY VAGINA!"

I was *twelve*. Ugh.
