I don't understand what people are angry at her about, if they consider the context. She works, she understands what it's like to work and be a mom, and she is saying that she feels like she is a better parent when she has time to spend with her kids. She is not parenting (or parenting very little) when she is working or away, so why wouldn't she be happy to have time off?

Same with some dads. When they have more time to spend with their kids, they probably feel like better parents.

It doesn't mean a full time working parent is a bad parent, but nobody can deny it's good to spend as much time as we can afford to spend, raising our children.
