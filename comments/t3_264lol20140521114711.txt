I work for a mid-size software company which is a division of a very large Fortune 500 company.

They will take this VERY SERIOUSLY.

My boss told me he would support me completely and would stand behind me and support my claims because he's heard this guy call others nicknames (though nothing racist or sexual). My boss was shocked at the nicknames I've heard. 

I just talked to another female coworker about this and she told me about a comment that she observed this manager say to another male manager, in front of her. I asked her if I could bring it up in my meeting with the VP and she said yes. So... who else has heard him say inappropriate things? I'm willing to guess, quite a few people.
