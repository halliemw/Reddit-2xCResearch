Women protect their body and, increasingly in the United States where legal abortions are being challenged, their freedom of choosing whether or not they want children.

While assuming all women are on birth control is partly assuming they have the responsibility, a lot of them - including me - are reaping benefits from it that goes well beyond not getting pregnant. From most reactions so far, women would not forego their own active methods if there was male contraception, but a shared responsibility would indeed be appreciated.
