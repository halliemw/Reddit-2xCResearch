Okay, I'm back.

For my dissertation project, I interviewed 30 pregnant or recently-pregnant (had given birth in the last 12 months) women who had, at some point in their pregnancies, used alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs (including illegal substances but also misuse of over-the-counter or prescription meds). I asked them to tell me their "life stories" or "personal myths" (not in that language, of course) and then asked them about key scenes from their lives, like low points, high points, turning points, childhood memories, etc. Then I asked them about some motherhood stuff, like their experiences as mothers and with their own mothers, who their motherhood role models were, where they learned how to be mothers, what they thought "good mothers" did/how "good mothers" behaved, ummm... oh, and then stuff about their experiences seeking and receiving substance abuse treatment and medical care, any barriers they encountered, how they navigated the medical, social service and criminal justice agencies they encountered, etc.

Beyond the theoretical stuff I was exploring in the dissertation, I tried to get at a lot of practical things. Relevant to the TN law, I found:

* The women I interviewed, especially the ones using what we'd consider "hard" drugs (like cocaine, heroin, meth) often had *horrific* histories of trauma and abuse. They were often homeless at a young age. 18 of 30 women in my study were victims of childhood sexual abuse, usually by fathers, stepfathers or other male relatives. Many women had gone on to be teenage or adult victims of sexual and physical abuse.

* Access to reproductive health care, especially abortion, was a big issue. Some of the women in my study were in extreme financial distress. When they found themselves pregnant, several women in the study wanted to get an abortion - one never wanted children and felt she was too young and unprepared to parent, another had three young children already and was struggling to pay her bills. These women wanted abortions but couldn't get the $570-ish together in time. The first girl I mentioned had a boyfriend who promised to get the money but then he didn't, and by the time all that was clear, it was too late for the abortion. She said they tried having him punch her in the stomach and throw her down stairs to cause a miscarriage but it didn't work. The second woman I mentioned, who had three kids already, just said "You can't get an abortion if you can't pay your light bill." I felt like this really represented the situation many women faced: at least if they had the child, they could get some social services to help with food and clothing. As pregnant women, they were kinda SOL.

* Treatment is more complicated than the public thinks. For starters, what is "treatment"? Many types of treatment are not very effective - I'm not an addiction specialist, but I can say that many treatment programs have HIGH rates of relapse. It's part of the addiction cycle, and many women in the study who HAD managed to quit said that it was just a matter of them being ready to do so - they could go to as many treatment programs the court could send them to, but if they weren't "ready," it didn't stick. Methadone treatment was a really good option for women who were using opiates, but it doesn't work for women who use other substances - those women usually ended up quitting by themselves (or not quitting). What became obvious as I went through the interviews was that there is only ONE residential treatment facility in my state that will accept pregnant women. Once the women in my study were pregnant, they were pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place: they needed to get treatment to stop using, but they couldn't find a treatment facility to take them (or they couldn't afford it, or had nobody to watch their older children, or had no transportation to get there, or didn't know how to find a facility) - but because they were pregnant, people would turn them away. Some women wanted to go cold-turkey and just have a doctor watch them while they detoxed, but doctors and nurses didn't want the liability, because withdrawal from some substances can cause miscarriage.

* People often police the decision of poor, substance-using women to have children. Some of the women in my study mentioned why they wanted to be mothers. For the women who mentioned it, they talked about how their children are the *only people* they have in this world. These women came, as I said, from backgrounds of trauma and abuse. Some of them had no relationships with family members anymore. It was really touching but heartbreaking when one mother explained to me that she intentionally got pregnant at 15 just "to have somebody who would love me and who I could love back."

* Another interesting thing I found was that several women had come into contact with the CJ system and faced consequences for their drug use *because they had been victims of intimate partner violence*. For example, one woman was pregnant and smoking marijuana - it was her way of self-medicating her depression and anxiety because she was trapped in a violent relationship. One night, she and her boyfriend got into an argument about him leaving his pornographic magazines where her children could find them, and he started hitting her. Her neighbors called the police, and when they showed up, they drug-tested her. She tested positive for THC. She was living in public housing at the time, so she got evicted (because of the police call - IPV victims are supposed to be protected, but nope), and the next day CPS showed up and took all of her children and put them in foster care. When she had her baby a few weeks later, they took him immediately and put him in foster care, too. It took her a YEAR to get her kids back - for marijuana use! Stories like this made women in my study hesitant to rely on the police for help, because they felt it was just as likely that they would suffer even *more* for having invited the police into their lives.
