I reckon you should stick with it for a bit. I've had mine since Sept 2012 and I had a couple of weird periods in the first months - one very light one a month after insertion, and one that lasted almost a month the following Feb. But since then nothing at all, and I used to get such heavy periods that I'd pass out and be anaemic a lot. Now I'm menstruation free for well over a year :) so letting your body get used to it seems to be a good idea.

Also if you're bad at remembering to take the pill, stay away from that - my not so wonderful experience of teenage pregnancy followed my complete uselessness on that front.
