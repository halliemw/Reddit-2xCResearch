I'm tall - 5'11" - so my options are selected accordingly. 

I love [eShakti](http://www.eshakti.com) - I have a dress that I ordered to my measurements and it fits like a dream. Staggeringly flattering. I've seen a couple of people on reddit who had complaints about quality, but I love what I've ordered from there.

I've got a couple of shirts and two pairs of pants from [Long Tall Sally](http://www.longtallsally.com). 

I get a lot of my t-shirts from Old Navy, honestly - they also come in Tall. I love their vintage v-neck t-shirts, I have a boatneck striped shirt of theirs that's years old and still looking good. 

Oh, and I got an awesome dress from [Dorothy Perkins](http://www.dorothyperkins.com). It's a UK shop but they ship to the US and the prices are totally reasonable.
