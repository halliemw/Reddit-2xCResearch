> When the other party has to closure to give you, it's unfair to expect them to invest in you emotionally when they're in the process of detaching. They don't owe you closure

Well, the not wanting to invest emotionally part when they are detaching makes some sense, but I am not so sure about the conclusion they don't owe you closure. 

Push the principle to the extreme. A couple is together and is happy. Then, one of the partners just leaves one day, at least as far as the other partner is concerned. Is that decision necessarily valid? Is closure really not required? 

Does you answer change whether it is the woman or the man who left? Does it change is they are married? Does it change if they have kids? 

I can't see that you are going to argue that it is valid under such circumstances, or there are a lot of dead beat parents who get off the hook because they decided that it was the right thing to do and that would all that would matter. 

And if it is not valid under those circumstances, then ....
