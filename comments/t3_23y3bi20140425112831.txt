I agree with all of you. You have to be happy with the pic to some point or you wouldn't post it, would you?
I, myself, am not pretty and skinny. I am curvy but not large. I am not happy with myself and I one day hope to be. I'm one of those people that can't accept compliments because I don't believe them. 
But at the end of the day, when I've picked apart everything I don't like about myself, I can honestly say I am grateful. I can walk, I can run, I can drive, I can have children, I can love.
Recently, I have found someone that loves me. I don't know what he sees in me but I smile now. I'm getting better with myself. 
Anyone who is making a healthier change for themselves, I wish you the very best. 
Anyone who is struggling with loving themselves, I wish I could hug you.
