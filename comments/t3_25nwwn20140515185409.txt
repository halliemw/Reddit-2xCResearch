I think it's clear that these comments were passive and by no means malicious or meant as a negative thought. Some people notice a difference in others appearance and, in seeing so, assume it was intentional and they're building up your self esteem in letting you know they see whatever hard work you may have been doing to achieve whatever difference they see. 

The blonde comment however... I'm sure that'll just be similar in that you've made a change and they're trying to let you know that your choice is a good one by complimenting and agreeing with your choice.

That being said, I agree with the other comments- don't bring up weight unless the person being discussed does first, that way you can't fuck up nor offend anyone.
