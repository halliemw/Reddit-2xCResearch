Avoid contact with the uncle at all possible. When you absolutely can't avoid being around him, have a buddy system: make sure it's never just you and him, and that you have at least one family member around that understands how creepy and wrong his behavior is.


Also, how old is your sister? Your uncle's behavior is extremely disconcerting. If she's a minor, she should never be left alone with him.
