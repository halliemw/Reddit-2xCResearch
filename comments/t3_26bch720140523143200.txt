I wouldn't even constitute it as a punishment, it's nothing more than sexual assault, I see that is what you meant but the wording sounds sympathetic. The punishment would be something decided by the parents or teacher and nothing anywhere near what actually happened, if a girl grabbed a guys butt then a group of them held her down and kicked her repeatedly in the crotch then it's not a punishment at all, it's a crime.
