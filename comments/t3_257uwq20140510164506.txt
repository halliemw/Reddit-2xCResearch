I am a big advocate for business/business casual dress in schools. Not because if a girl shows shoulder the world will collapse from teenage hormones overdrive or anything. I just think it would be nice if high school, maybe middle school, kids learn how to dress in the professional world. I don't think many of them understand that even sure a basic retail job you need to be presentable for the interview. And business casual can still be fun and fashionable.
