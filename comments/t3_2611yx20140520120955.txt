My experience working along side women is "different".  The women I work with are intelligent, capable, and mostly engineers and / or programmers.  Easy as heck to work with, no mess, no fuss.  

That being said, the administrative type women in the office are the bane of most people's existence. Nice to you on the level but will not hesitate to stab you in the back.  Sounds like the bunch you're stuck with.

My advise is to ignore these toxic elements as much as you can.  Find other people in the company who you are better apt to socialize with.
