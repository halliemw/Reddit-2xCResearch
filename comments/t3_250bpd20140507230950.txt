On the other hand, no one would send her home if she walked in wearing a ratty sweatshirt, pajama pants, and slippers (a common look at that school).  It's considered more appropriate because she is covered up.  But a cute outfit isn't appropriate because she's tall and her skirt is showing?

I totally get your argument and agree that dress codes partially prepare kids for professional dress, but I do love playing devil's advocate!
