If you have a gun, never post on Facebook or Twitter that you have one. You are advertising to the world that you have a weapon for them to come steal from you. 

I had a very good friend go through the same thing. They posted multiple pictures of their gun collection on Facebook and Twitter until one day when the hubby stepped out for literally 10 minutes, some guys kicked in thier front door and held a gun to her head and asked for all her guns. 

Yes my story may be uncommon but it seems like pretty good advice, to avoid advertising you have guns in the house.
