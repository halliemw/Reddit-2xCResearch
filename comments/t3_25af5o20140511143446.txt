I'm choosing to not have children.  I try to say that it is because I'm just not wired that way, but I think it goes back to exactly what you said.  "The anguish I felt ends with me."  I'm terrified of leaving behind a child who knows me only through photos and fading memories.

Wishing you the absolute best.
