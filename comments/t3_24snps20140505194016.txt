I kinda get this too. Honestly I don't care anymore. I like dresses, jeans, my short hair, my very visible tattoos, comics, makeup, etc. Most people's understanding of gender is incredibly limited. Gender is not a binary. It is a spectrum and a performance. I can wear my husbands jeans one day and my favorite sundress the next. People also want to conflate gender and sexuality. "If someone presents as not-strictly feminine, they must be trying to present as hetero-masculine!" Nope. Sorry. Try again. Though misconceptions can also act as really nice filters for stupid people.
