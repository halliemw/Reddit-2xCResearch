I've never really been sure how much is due to genuine internal conflict vs people SAYING how you're supposed to regret it for life and never be able to reconcile the guilt.

Seems to me that if simply did it and moved on with your life, this message implies you're secretly a cruel, heartless psychopath by not being devastated by your decision.  Because everyone else regrets it for life, right?
