It's not your fault that you were raped. That having been said, I think you need to end the relationship and take care of your problems for both your sakes.

Showing up after self-cutting and asking your boyfriend to make concessions that he clearly didn't want to make is emotional blackmail. It is a horrible thing to do.

Please, get yourself help and abstain from relationships until you are better and in a position to handle them.
