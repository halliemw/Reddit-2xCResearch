People are naturally territorial, men and women. In your case, it seems like you're dealing with women being territorial. I'm in the same boat as you! My problem with SOME (not all!!) women, is that they're hard to trust, as well as maintain a regular friendship with them. However, I also have trust issues with some male friends, because I'm sometimes unsure of their intentions with our friendship. It all depends which situation you're dealing with. 

I wonder if you're just around a more difficult crowd at the moment. I have one group of friends and all the "new" girls are so friendly. Especially if you welcome them personally. Asking them questions, including them in your interests and conversations. We all get along great, and I love it, but sometimes it really does take that extra effort. 

Just try to look passed the biased "bitchiness and drama" because I assure you not all females are like that, just like how not all men are pigs. You just have to look in the right places for each of them.

When I said I was in the same boat as you, I meant I don't have many female friends. Literally I can think of only 2 I hang out with regularly, both great people. I wish I had more girl friends, but hey, life goes on and falls into place how it does, and you just have to accept it. I have fears of rejection, so it's tough for me to make new friends, but slowly but surely, it happens.
