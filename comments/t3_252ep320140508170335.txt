I was in the fourth grade and was raised in a considerably conservative Muslim household. My mother never educated me on such matters, really. So one night before bed, I go to pee, as usual... except there are like two lines of blood going down the toilet bowl and I am petrified. I remember my initial reaction was wondering if I had somehow gotten bitten by a bug (???). Teach your daughters about periods, folks.

My mother thought it was super strange that I had started bleeding so early, and was convinced that Allah was "punishing me," et cetera. She had a way of making me paranoid about literally everything. I was told not to tell anyone that I had my period-- because she feared people would be judgmental about how early I had gotten it. I remember hanging out with my closest cousin one afternoon and having "leaked." I was terrified of her finding out-- because of the fear my mother instilled in me about people finding out. I would go out of my way to conceal pads in trashcans, etc. These weren't the best years of my life.
