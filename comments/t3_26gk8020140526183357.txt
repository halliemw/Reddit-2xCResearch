So are you saying "fraternizing" with students is wrong?  Because when school is out, there are tons of students (of all sexes) who want to hang out with teachers.  There are clubs, extra-curriculars and tutoring and some students manage to spend a lot of time with a particular teacher.  I think that's fine.

It's the teacher who must hold the boundary.  "It just happened" is not a good enough excuse.  Teachers who are at "rock bottom" need assistance themselves, of course, as you suggest.
