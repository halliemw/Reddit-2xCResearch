I in no way think that they should not have included the content. However, since this particular incident I have seen many student presentations (undergrad and grad) that included disturbing material, and 9 times out of 10 the presenter would say something to the effect of "The next image is pretty messed up". The fact that no one in this group thought that an image of a dead woman with her dress pulled up and a bayonet shoved into her vagina would fall into this category is strange, to say the least.
Look, I am not asking that material be censored. I am not even asking that someone ask for my consent before showing me such material. I am simply asking that I be told that it is going to happen.
