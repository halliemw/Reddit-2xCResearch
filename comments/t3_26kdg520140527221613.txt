Lol, neither can I! :D But it wasn't just the eyebrow thing that helped her, though. On the whole, she acted like there was nothing notable about her, except for her love for football, friendships, etc. So I think the surrounding boys felt stupid saying something. In our context, the teasing only continued when there was a reaction. So slightly-chubby little me got teased a lot because I turned red and gaspy, while my friend with adult-sized boobs got absolutely nothing because she responded to everything with "So?" or "And?"

Good point about boob reduction for the future, just in case things don't work out between you and your boobs. I hope you give them a chance though. (then again, mine are a/aa, so I have boob envy)
