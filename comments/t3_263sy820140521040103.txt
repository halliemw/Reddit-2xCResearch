Personally, I think it's somewhere in the middle. It's totally fair for you to have priorities and boundaries for your relationships, and if you're expressing them at the beginning (and reiterating them), then your partner should know what's expected of them. If they then begin making romantic advances, they've breached the contract - kick 'em to the curb.

On the other hand, what's not fair is to demand that they don't have emotions about you. If they become more enamoured than they expected, that's not their fault. If they begin to express that to you, they're over the line - but they can't help feeling how they feel. And sure, maybe you can HOPE that someday someone will be honest with you about having that feeling, and be the one to do the splitting up, but that's really unrealistic. If someone is romantically attracted to you, and you've said you want to keep it strictly sexual, _of course_ they're going to be afraid to bring it up to you - they don't want to lose the connection you DO have.

Overall, if you don't want to be "deceptive," you should make sure you're not sending them any confusing signals with your behavior. But in my opinion, the type of relationship you're looking for is extremely rare. The "fuck buddy" set up rarely leaves both parties satisfied. Someone almost always gets hurt in the end.

Edit: and yes, it is your responsibility to end these relationships. If you're the one setting up an ultimatum, it's your responsibility to uphold it.
