I got mine on Hallowe'en too. I was twelve. I've always been a big reader and I had been reading teen lit since I was nine or ten years old, so I knew enough that I wasn't surprised or freaked out. My mom gave me some pads and told me to be discreet about throwing them away, and the next time I went to the library I read a bunch of medical books on the subject. After that I think I knew more than my mom did.
