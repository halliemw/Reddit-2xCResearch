It really sucks when your life gets turned upside down by such things, but everything works out.  
  
Stay strong, stay the course. You'll be alright and will find ways to do what you need to.  
  
Your mum needs to work her own shit out. If your dad is abusing her, then she needs to leave of her own free will. You can't feel guilty over something that is outside your control and *not in any way your fault*.
