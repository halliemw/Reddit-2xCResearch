I don't understand why the hell everything is downvoted here. Anywyas, the reason why I asked is that if you know the causes that trigger it the first step is done- you know what to fix. There are two good ways to deal with it that I can think of now. First, learn how to stop caring so much about what other people think and compare yourself with them. Go to /r/stoicism and read some stoic philosophers. Trust me, it's worth it! Second: if your weight is bothering you, make a program for yourself to go to the gym, start slowly and have lots and lots of patience with yourself. Remember that you deserve to be happy and healthy and most of all learn to like yourself for who you are.
