So someone proposes one question, seeing a 17% drop in men's DUI arrests and a 20% rise in women's DUI arrests and tries to explore that question, your response is 'What about the men?"

Yes, society needs to examine the entire problem, but it is perfectly okay to have one article on this part of the data involving women. It's not a competition ("bigger story").


If you want to start a discussion about men's statistics, the report is linked in the article. http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/33tabledatadecoverviewpdf

Also, the article, if you read it, does discuss men comparatively, including when it comes to the numbers of drunk driving fatalities, which have decreased on both sides.
