Gurl...prepare yourself for some tears with BSW. It is so damn good, but keep the tissue box handy because it is one of the rawest films I've ever watched. It is one of the few films that manages to be both exhilarating as well as devastating. I constantly re-watch [this opening sequence of the movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZYd5MOHXck) because it always makes me smile/happy cry!
