I started my period when I was 9.5 (though I don't know when I began the early stages- I'm gonna guess about 8 or so? I didn't really notice) as did my mom and grandma, so it wasn't terribly strange. The only advice I can give is to make sure you actually discuss these sensitive topics instead of awkwardly dancing around them. Being the first in the grade to start puberty was really awkward and it would have been nice to know someone was willing to actually talk about things that were happening to my body rather than guess or look up worst-case scenarios online. It doesn't make for a confident, well-adjusted adult. 

If you're really concerned, maybe your mom should discus it with your sisters pediatrician. On the off chance there's a problem with the rate of her development, the doctor can offer answers.
