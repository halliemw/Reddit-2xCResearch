I think teaching about body image and the media would be valuable, a la [Killing Us Softly](http://www.mediaed.org/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=241). Kids that age often absorb media messages without questioning them, so critical thinking about media and advertising is pretty important. 

I also think stress management is a great skill to teach kids that age. Mindful meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, breathing, stretching, etc. Healthy stress management can reduce risk of more high-risk coping mechanisms like cutting, purging, hair-pulling/picking, etc.
