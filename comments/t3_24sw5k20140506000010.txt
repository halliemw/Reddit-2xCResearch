In my mind a one off sexual experience is significantly less damaging than a sustained emotional connection that leads to him calling it off with me and immediately jumping into a long term, committed relationship with her. I can sure tell you that it hurts more.

He made the conscious decision to pursue something that pulled him away from the person he claimed to love, support and want.  He put someone else before me. Even after I expressed concern about it.
