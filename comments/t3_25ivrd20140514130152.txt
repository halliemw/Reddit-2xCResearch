It's worse than that -- Gene Balk (/u/GeneBalk) at the Seattle Times did the research. This guy wrote an article about it without giving any credit to Mr. Balk.

The more I read from this guy, the more obvious it is why he isn't getting dates. I'm a young woman in Seattle, I know about the dating scene, and I know a guy like this is going to get at most one date. I'm kind of surprised Ms 4 Months put up with him that long.
