I mean, I agree that's it's ridiculous that users here are part of the problem. I agree that it is good to know what's going on. 

The wording of their post was shitty, though. If the point is to give a better picture of what's happening, then it was kind of unnecessary to include quantitative data - we only really needed qualifiers. They could just have said, "here's a thing that's happening, so be aware that some of the complaints your hearing might not be honest." Instead, they threw out a bogus number, and said something like, "take all these complaints with a HUGE grain of salt." What the fuck is that? "Most of you all are liars, so don't trust anyone." Not. Helpful.

They might have gone back to correct it, or made later comments amending it, but the damage is done. Even here in this comments section, you see people invoking the "only four legitimate reports of harassment" thing, despite the mods and admins pointing out that it's not at all representative the whole picture.

It was a poor decision, and the repercussions of that decision are going to echo around in here until this bullshit clears up. The bullshit won't clear up until bans start getting passed around more freely, imo.
