When my husband and I were dating he had a shitty old Mustang that he pined over. He spent every free moment with that stupid car. He sold it at one point. It made me so resentful and upset that all of his spare time was in the garage. I lived over an hour away and would drive out to see him and he would be with his car. Mind you if he was able to balance time with the car and me I wouldn't care but he wasn't able to do that.

The 401k thing is concerning to me, especially seeing as you are financially responsible. Remember this if you ever get engaged.
