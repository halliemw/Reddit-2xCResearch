Your hair dryer will not work with just a plug converter UNLESS your hair dryer has a 110/220 switch on it.  If it does, you can move it to the 220 position and use it while in Europe.

Your hair dryer won't even work with a little voltage transformer from Radio Shack or wherever -- you need a major duty transformer to be able to use something like that.

Your phone charger, laptop charger, etc. should work fine with just a plug converter -- make sure to pay attention to whether your laptop has a 3-prong plug though, because that can be a pain to deal with if your plug converter won't fit with it.

Bring a box of bandaids in case you aren't used to walking as much as you will while on vacation.

Be super careful about pickpockets.  There are a lot of them in the big cities in Italy, and they're very good.  If someone tries to hand you bird seed to feed birds in a public square -- run away.  They are just trying to get you to raise your arms up so someone else can bump into you can more easily rob you.

Learn the phrase "vino di casa" (no idea if I spelled that right...).  It basically means "house wine".  Most places you can just order the house red and it will be just fine.

Plan plenty in advance for things like visiting the Colosseum -- lines are very long.

If you can afford to, buy an unlocked Android phone like the Moto G off of the Google Play website (under $200).  Get yourself a pre-paid sim card with data on the first day you're over there, and you'll have access to the internet, Google searching, Google maps, etc. -- it will make your trip a whole lot easier, and really isn't that expensive (well, the phone is a bit expensive at a little under $200...and the sim/plan will cost you another $40 or $50...but you can use the phone on future trips).
