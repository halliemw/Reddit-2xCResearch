I was about to reply, then decided to see if someone had answered you already. /u/katinabox did a nice job, probably better than I could have :)

Sometimes there are situations where the person who has lived the experience will have a perspective that has been honed by years of such experiences of varying degree to a very accurate instrument. Telling them that they have it wrong is not productive, and makes this space less supportive.

If in doubt, assume the person's experience is accurate and their opinions on what was happening are probably correct, offer advice or criticisms of their actions with that assumption as the base. When people offer advice but start with the assumption that your perception of the situation is wrong, it devolves into unproductive arguments.
