You're not alone. A lot of people have been in your shoes before, myself included- in fact, my most recent breakup was just a couple months ago.

There *is* a light at the end of the tunnel. It *will* get better. For my very first difficult breakup with the person I was in love with many many years ago, I felt like I was shredded to pieces. I couldn't sleep, eat, and I lost the will to do anything. Despite what people told me, I absolutely thought that it would never get better, that my life was "over".

And yet, here I am. It's been years and I don't think of him at all. After that breakup, I was wrecked every time his name was mentioned. Now, I feel nothing. If I had traveled back in time to the past and told myself back then that I would be fine in the future, past me would've *never* believed it. But it's true. I'm here, and I'm feeling absolutely fine.

...Well, maybe not *too* fine, just because I got dumped from my newest relationship just a couple months ago. And even now, I'm definitely still heartbroken from this recent one, because so much had happened between us. Yet, every time I feel heartbroken, I look back to the past and think about how wrecked I was back then too. But I remind myself that if I recovered from that first breakup, I will recover again. It's still a little hard to believe now, but it was also hard to believe then. But it will happen. And it will happen to you too. Sometimes, it's true that time is the only thing that will help, however there are many things you can do to accelerate it- delete him entirely from your life, start new activities, go to new places, hang out with family and friends, and simply replace your old memories with new memories, which, as long as you keep living, you will.

You will be fine, because you *are* stronger than that. :)
