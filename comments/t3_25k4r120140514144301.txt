No one here can (or should) tell you what to do. Ultimately, the choice is yours, and that's both a daunting and liberating thing. There are pros and cons to either option, as I'm sure you're well aware.  

On the one hand, you have the cost and dangers of carrying, giving birth to, and raising a child on your own, and on the other, you face a medical procedure shrouded in stigma. And both have positives as well.   

I think ultimately you're going to have to just trust yourself - no one knows you and what's best for you better.  

If you have any specific questions about abortion or pregnancy or child birth, definitely ask those and maybe people can point you toward resources or information you need.
