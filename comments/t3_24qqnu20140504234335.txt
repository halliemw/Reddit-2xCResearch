Yeah, it's just hard to bring up topics like this. He gets mad, I get even more restrictions, and then it just lose/lose for everyone.

Luckily, I lived outside my home for all of undergrad and my masters degree program, so I've been able to gain more independence over the last 5 years. It's just when I return home, I suddenly lose all privileges and it's back to square one where I have to ask to go out. It's really frustrating because it feels like I regress every time I go back home...which is why I never went back home much during undergrad even though I lived an hour away.
