I've heard it said on this subreddit before... $1 is an extremely cheap price for sanity :). Plus, you can get multipacks of tests on amazon for way cheaper than that. It's not a bad idea just to keep one or two of those around for reassurance, particularly since stress can cause you to be late even without sex.
