Honestly, it is shit that men should know anyway so they know what their wives, mothers and daughters go through. It helps everyone be a little more compassionate. I go out of my way to learn what men go through so I understand the pressures my boyfriend and brother face and it helped my relationship with them and helped me understand why they behave in certain ways.
