Hey, here is a website:

sometimes it helps to see what ACTUAL women's bodies look like and not edited ones. I felt kind of the same as you did so I did a bit of lookin' around and realised I was worrying about nothing. 

I actually went on gonewild for a bit, to see actual real people look like without their photos edited etc. That helped too.


Long story short I now feel pretty great about all of my body, sometimes you can't just love it right away you just need to learn to appreciate it. I still forget sometimes.
