She says that she wears head phones already. I completely understand and agree with the idea that we can control how we feel way more than we can control the world, but I don't think that will help OP at the moment. The thing about pervasive street harassment is that the crude comments can be a lot easier to shrug off, because that person is obviously an asshole. It's the smaller things and their constant presence that can wear someone down. Being grabbed and groped and felt up when you're just walking down the side walk can be much worse than a crude comment. Having cars and people intentionally following you around can create a low level feeling of fear that is extremely hard to shake, and with good reason. OP mentioned both being groped and being followed in her opening post. Asking her what bothers her about what people say is a little bit un-empathetic, if you ask me. I think she makes it clear that it's not the specific comments, but the constant state of harassment that she must negotiate just to live her life.
