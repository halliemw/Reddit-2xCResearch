I get what you're saying and I don't totally disagree, but then I would argue that there are plenty of infants in other countries that need to be adopted, so I'm still against giving babies up for adoption if it can be avoided. I know a lot of people probably don't share my view, I just tend to think that abortion is often the best option when a woman doesn't think she's prepared to have a child.
