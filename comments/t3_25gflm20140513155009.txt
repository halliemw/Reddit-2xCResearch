When over 1/3 of a country suffers from a health condition, I start to look at environmental factors and education. I'm pretty sure 1/3 of our country isn't just lazy slobs, so what is it that's causing an obesity crisis of this magnitude? What are we not doing that we should be doing? I'd start with poor food availability for one, poor education, poor healthcare, a lack of safe places for exercise in many communities, and possibly some environmental and epigenetic factors. There's proof of leptin resistance in obese individuals, which is something we have a hard time quantifying and no way of treating right now. What's causing that? I'm inclined to think it's epigenetic or perhaps crosstalk with a different signaling pathway that's shutting down the downstream effectors of the leptin receptor, but right now we don't know and without that knowledge, we can't diagnose or treat the issue. Without a good way to get an accurate diagnosis, we have no way of quantifying how large the problem is.
