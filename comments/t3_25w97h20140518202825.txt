It's not your fault that he is depressed & it's not his fault that you have anxiety issues.  It sounds like both of you need counseling to work through your issues.  Neither of you are healthy & that is creating an unhealthy relationship dynamic.  

You ask what you should do when you are freaking out over the dysfunctional relationship- it is completely within your power to end the cycle.  Get out of this relationship & work on healing yourself.  If he also gets help, there might be a chance in the future for a healthier relationship.  If you continue the cycle, the chances will be greatly reduced for having a healthy relationship with him.
