>I am less likely to trust men in general and am sadly reduced to evaluating men walking past me on the street to see if they present a threat. The last thing I want to do is to reduce someone to their gender, but it is a method of self-protection.

I wish more guys understood this. It's not that I think you're a predator. It's that you *could be* a predator, and I have no way of knowing whether you are or not, so if I'm alone and feeling vulnerable, I'm going to try to avoid you. It's not personal. It's that I really don't feel like getting catcalled, groped, or kissed against my will again, or worse.
