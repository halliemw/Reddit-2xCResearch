As for owning a gun, you say you are not comfortable with it and that's totally fine. Having a firearm is a last line of defense and takes a lot of time to get used to. People think just because you have a pistol in your hand now means your invincible and that's so far from the truth. You'd have better luck using a tazer if they are legal in your state since with this device. You could use it immediately and without regret since the odds of the voltage being fatal is really low.
