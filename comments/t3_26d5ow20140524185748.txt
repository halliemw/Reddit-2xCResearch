If you'd like to learn more about your cycle, there are ways to do that, usually used by women trying to get pregnant - tracking basal body temperature (your temperature rises when you ovulate, and stays high until a day or two before your period), tracking cervical mucus or cervical position, etc. It's not necessary, but if you're worried about irregular periods, it could give you some understanding of what's going on.

That said, I agree with others here that it's probably normal, and birth control pills would probably help.
