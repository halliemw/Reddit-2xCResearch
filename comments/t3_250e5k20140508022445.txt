This is an AWFUL article for the following reasons:

1) Dreadlocks have always been banned, they just weren't banned by AR-670-1.  AR-670-1 was updated to include the ban on dreadlocks

2) Cornrows weren't banned.  That's not a factual statement.

Cornrows were reduced in allowable with so people can't look like[ Riley from the boondocks](http://i.imgur.com/XbjvTUO.jpg) 

3) the only hairstyle that was previously allowable that has been banned is twists.  [Twists were banned because they interfere with wear of the uniform](http://i.imgur.com/jX63xMo.jpg)

4) if they want to shave their heads like the men, they are allowed.  If the men want to bop around on the weekend looking like Kat Williams they have to wear a wig.  Female soldiers still have considerably more leeway in hair styling than male soldiers
