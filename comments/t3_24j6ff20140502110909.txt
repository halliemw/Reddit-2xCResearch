So I've seen this go down multiple times and while it's antecedent it has been enough of a trend that it likely holds. I also work in marketing, internet based, where you see wild swings in success.  What I have seen with my women colleges and a few friends who have had this arrangement is that everything remains hunky dory until the woman starts seeing real success...when her pay is 3,4,5,10 times better than her husbands. At some point it becomes pointless for the husband to hold down a 35-50k job when she is making close to 200k and the decision is made for the husband to quit and focus on the family and be a stay at home dad. Shortly after this, especially so if her success continues to climb, resentment starts to build as while she is seeing a high level of success she isn't seeing the fruits of that labor as her income is divided between two adults and a family. So the awesome vacation destinations, expensive material goods, and sophisticated/wild nights out never materialize. Around this time is usually when the man starts to be treated like one of the children or a pet. This is what really struck me as every time I would go over to a persons house or out to dinner there was this dude attached to my friend who is "Yes Dear"ing his way through the evening. This is generally when the convention affairs start or the woman eventually realizes she could be much more successful AND finally enjoy the fruits of her labor if she were to create a power couple with someone her financial and professional equal and the marriage ends up in divorce. Mid life crisis only exasperates this. It happens with men too though they are more likely to cheat than to look for a social equal.
