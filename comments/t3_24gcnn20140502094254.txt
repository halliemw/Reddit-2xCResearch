I feel like a lot of those don't so much reflect growing up *boys* but simply growing up. Like, you could plug the main character as a girl and it wouldn't change too much. But I'm not familiar with all of them. I mean, I don't like that so many of the big name coming of age stories are always from a boy pov. Idk.
