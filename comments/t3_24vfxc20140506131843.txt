Not really. Chest/back hair especially isn't my thing. My boyfriend has a small "treasure trail" leading to his groin and virtually nothing else and I love it. OTOH I have a friend who dated a guy who was kinda ugly and a jerk for a good month longer than she should have because she loved his full luscious body hair *that much*.

People get too hung up on being universally attractive. What's important is finding a partner who is specifically attracted to *you*.
