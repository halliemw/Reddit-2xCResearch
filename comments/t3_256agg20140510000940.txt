I have to say, although I am sure the mods are working hard to curtail the trolls, the general atmosphere in this sub since becoming default really seems to have taken a dark turn. 

I've just spent some time going over the last few pages of posts and the amount of anger and hate both in the post content and in the comments is really troubling. 

Although I'm sure becoming default will bring in a lot of new faces and new ideas I have to wonder at what cost.
