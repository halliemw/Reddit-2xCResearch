I should have been more specific about xenoestrogens like BPA and phytoestrogens like [soy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074428/). But they act the same way, as an endocrine disruptor.

Edit: I'll see if I can find it again but I found another article in my search that says the concern about increased phytoestrogens in soy has to do with GMO soy. This might explain the lack of precocious puberty in Asian populations, though I think I read on another page that the age is dropping in Asian populations as well. I'll look around and see if I can  find my source for that.



Edit: Phytoestrogens may have health benefits for older women but it doesn't mean they can't cause early puberty in young girls. Especially with GMO soy.
