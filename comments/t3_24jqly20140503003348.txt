Same with the nipples. It actually makes me slightly uncomfortable when my SO plays with them, like he were playing with one of my toes or something (it just seems weird to me). And they hurt during moon sickness.

I can bend my fingers at the top knuckle and bend my thumbs backwards - the right one I can lay flat to my wrist, backwards (I can get both flat to my wrists forwards). 

I CAN'T tube or twist my tongue. Everyone else seems to be able to...
