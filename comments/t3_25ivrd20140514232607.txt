From whose point of view?

Doesn't that go to the heart of the problem behind this essay? The guy thinks he did everything right, and isn't happy. He seems to think he acted properly both during the relationship and during the breakup.

If you want to say he is "wrong", ok, but that kind of just begs the question.
