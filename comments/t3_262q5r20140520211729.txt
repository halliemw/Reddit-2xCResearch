why though? all telling him does is potentially ruin his day. he can do nothing about it one way or the other aside from the slim possibility of violence against OP, the merest threat of which makes me disinclined to recommend that avenue at all.

the possible outcomes of telling this guy simply aren't worth the risk

don't tell him: nothing happens. 

tell him: he's ok with it, he makes a big deal out of it, he uses it as something to yell at her about later, or he uses it as an excuse to beat her up, he could even pretend to be cool with it and then change his mind about the whole thing, fer Christsakes he could tell her *grandma* about it, he could use it to publicly shame her in person or on the internet, he could do a lot of damage and from what I've heard here I don't trust him not to.

there's too much risk, not enough reward.  I'm a firm believer in the truth, but in this case telling the truth to that guy could get OP hurt, and that's not ok.
