I think Sansa will be a dark horse. No one survives that long in King's Landing without being savvy. She was really good at telling Lysa what she wanted to hear, too. And I think you've similarly probably developed a lot of coping mechanisms and armor you don't know you have. 

Honestly? It might be worth looking into therapy. A lot of shrinks and therapists are terrible, but a lot are also good at what they do. Learning to trust yourself isn't something you can do overnight, and you will have to do that before you can start discerning the motives of other people. That's not to say you should spend time with a psych you don't like, but you could at least look into some different kinds of therapy and see if one of them seems like a good starting point. (If you haven't already.)
