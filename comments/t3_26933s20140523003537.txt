By "inappropriate" I meant within context. There are certain contexts in which that sort of behavior would not be a problem. But that it would be appropriate in any context is highly unlikely. Living within a society means that adults are expected to reasonably be able to identify when things are or are not appropriate. No one expects this to be executed perfectly each and every time, but believe it or not, humans are actually quite capable of picking up what has been deemed a social norm or more. That's where tact comes into play. I'm not saying no one gets to have their sexual fantasies, no matter how fucked up they may seem to me. All I'm saying is if you're going to make them explicit to other people, do your best to ensure that it's the right time and place. If you don't, you're tactless, and that's your prerogative, but you'll face whatever consequences there may be then.
