Ok, so financial incentive can explain why some subways in the UK are now serving halal meat.

Your original statement was that thinking the ROI were somehow now allowing FGM to happen was not unwarranted because Subway in the UK is sometimes serving halal meat. I don't understand how you got from FGM in Ireland to Halal meat in the UK.
