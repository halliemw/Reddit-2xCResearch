There's the small statistical probability of the pill failing, but otherwise, it seems doubtful you would be pregnant. You said there was a bit of yeast infection type discharge with the spotting? You could have a yeast infection that's irritated your cervix and caused the spotting. Could even be the reason for the 'heavy' feeling. Honestly, if I were you I would try not to worry unless you're late. Even of the pill were failing, given 'normal' menstrual cycles, you'd just be ovulating around now, not at the end of your period.
