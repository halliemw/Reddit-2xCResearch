Yes. Though, I wouldn't use the word crazy or insane. More like, very young and a bit naive. You said your mom is wise to a fault, and because of this you are afraid of tell her. Maybe because you secretly know it's not a wise decision? There is no need to rush into such a huge life event. If you are truly meant to be together, then spending a little more time with each other as boyfriend/girlfriend shouldn't be a deal breaker. 

No sex before marriage, no living together before marriage, sounds like you both come from fairly conservative upbringings. If you want to do those things with your boyfriend, but feel marriage is the only way to accomplish that, perhaps that is why you both feel so eager to jump into things. 

These are just the opinions of a random 30-something lady on the internet who knows absolutely nothing about your or your boyfriend's life, experiences, ambitions, or temperament. I do, however, know a great deal about relationships and the changes you will undergo in your 20's. Ultimately, you are going to do whatever you want to do, and rightfully so. You both are still very young, your brains are still developing, your hormones are like the mighty Amazon, and things just seem like they can't happen fast enough. My advice is to give it a little more time. If it's true love, then time will only strengthen it.
