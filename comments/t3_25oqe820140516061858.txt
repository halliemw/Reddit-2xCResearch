I had a similar situation to what you describe. In my rape, it was a lady cop who spoke with me after the incident. I was calm (numb, really) telling her the details, showing her the emails where the guy had threatened to hurt my entire family if I didn't comply, etc. She responded that emails could be forged, that I seemed too calm, etc. When she interviewed my rapist, he was smiling and charming and said how it had been consensual (during the act, he had screamed at me to "move around more" and "act like I liked it" because I was just lying there crying, but of course he denied all that). In the end, the cop told me I had no case, and not to waste the police's time anymore. They had no interest in actually helping me. I felt completely powerless. So yeah, I know my own story is just one story, but the cops were definitely not bending over backwards to help.
