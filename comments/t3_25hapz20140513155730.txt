I don't think he is doing anything wrong exactly (aside from forgetting your anniversary), but it does sound like you both have incompatible lifestyles and/or lifestyle expectations. It may be a simple matter of bringing it up to him and seeing if he is willing to compromise. You're not out of line for having different needs than he does, but communication of those needs is key. 

Did you give him something for the anniversary and still haven't gotten anything, or are you waiting for him to bring it up before you exchange gifts? He might not be aware that there is a problem at all.
