I'd say dump him then.  Money wise, you are making due, and you can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  You're daughter is youmg, but in a few years, she is going to start to understand that she is a burden on him, and no chiild should ever feel that.  Get him out of your lives while he's willing before the situation becomes toxic.

I went kinda through the oppisite when my mom and dad split when I was three.  She moved halfway across the country and refused to let my dad see me.  As a result, my father and I have a very akward relationship.  I love him dearly, but he and his side of the family are practically strangers.  It's sad, and didn't have to be that way.
