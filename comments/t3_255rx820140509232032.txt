Yes! I was in my thirties before I finally decided I had better ask the doctor about it. And she was like, "Oh. Yeah. Totally normal. Almost everyone does that. And it's a real mess, b/c a lot of the time people get constipated for a few days before too."

Which is not something to which I had paid attention prior...but she is totally right.
