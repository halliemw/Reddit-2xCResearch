Honestly? Give yourself some time from this situation, not your whole relationship. Tell him he violated your trust and that he needs to make amends if he wants this relationship to continue. If it was me and my bf? I'd keep an eye out for any weird behavior from him and do couples therapy. I suggest therapy because if my partner violated my trust to the level of me questioning the relationship, after so much together,  I'd make damn sure this wasn't working before ending it entirely. 

Emotional and physical affairs do happen. 1 time slip ups also happen.
