I think she took this to be a story of date rape, where you were drugged or unconscious and someone had sex with you, in which case she may be a mandatory reporter, I'm not sure what the laws around adults are. I know when it comes to children and suspected abuse medical workers are mandatory reporters.

In any case, call a pharmacy. Explain that you had a condom failure, then took Plan B, then had another condom failure, and you need to know if you're covered. I'm inclined to say you are, but I'm not an expert on emergency contraception. That should get you a straight answer.

If the police do get involved, they don't have any evidence unless you give them some. Don't tell them you think you had sex when you were unconscious or don't remember, because that's rape. If anything, tell them you forgot a condom and didn't want to admit it or anything. Unless, of course, your boyfriend did have sex with you when you were unconscious, in which case you need to have a very adult conversation about consent and protection and never having this happen again.
