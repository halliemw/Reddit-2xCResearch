You're certainly right. Like I mentioned, I am not offended by being asked out or when guys show an interest in me, the problem really comes with the lack-of-prior knowledge thing. Getting asked to go out romantically rather than to hang out and get to know each other. I know that society doesn't really openly encourage such a thing, but still. I just wish there was a way around it.
