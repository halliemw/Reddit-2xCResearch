I agree!  There was also this negative stigma toward engineering when I was growing up.  A disproportionate amount of girls say things like "I'm so bad at math."  A STEM career is not just sitting at a computer and punching things in your calculator.  You could be working on an oil rig, making artificial organs, constructing bridges, building jet engines, etc.  I was lucky enough to go to an engineering camp for girls when I was little and we did things like look at the biomechanics of wearing high heels and the chemistry behind cosmetics.  There are so many cool things to talk about!
