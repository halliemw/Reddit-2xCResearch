>dose would have just been raised instead of a second opiate administered

I'm not a pharmacist, but there are lots of instances where two pain relief modalities are used because it is more effective and safer than just upping the dose (paracetamol and codeine being a famous one).  Because I am not a pharmacist and don't have the drug sheet in front of me I can't make a guess on the persons level of incapacitation.
