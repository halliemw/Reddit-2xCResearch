I just bought my first girly proper bathing suit ever this weekend, but before that, I seriously just wore dude's swim trunks and a regular old bikini top. I prefer the style, honestly, even when you take my body issues out of the question. I like being a little butch sometimes, I guess. (Plus, it could cover up the shorts tan on your legs, if that's something you're concerned about, though it won't do much to fix it. I can't help in that department, though, as I don't tan.) Also, you don't need to worry about a bikini bottom creeping into your ass crack, which, I don't know, was always a pretty big issue for me and my giant all-consuming ass. 

No one's ever looked at me weirdly for doing it, and I have *no* tan at all. You could probably do a tankini top if you want to cover up the appendicitis scars, though in my experience, people don't seem to care that much? Though I might just have really not-nosy friends.
