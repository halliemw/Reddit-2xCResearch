It was a lot easier for me though, I have to say, because my dad is already partially estranged from my family. Basically my entire family lived on the West Coast, he cheated on my mom for a very long time with another, younger woman and when my mom found out left her for the bimbo and moved to the East to be with his shiny new family, that whole stereotypical story. I tried to be forward-thinking about it because maybe he was just really unhappy and I didn't really know anything about marriage at that age. Two years after he left, I decided to move out east to live with him so I could attend a university prep school right by his house and increase my chances of getting into a good university -- I hadn't been doing well in school but I really wanted to turn that around. 

He had always been violent when we were kids but nothing compared to how he was with this new family. He put on this charade when he was around them and then when it was just him and me, he let all of that pent-up frustration from living a lie right out onto me. He was too arrogant to deal with his guilt over what he'd done to our family and what he'd given it up for, and he took that right out on me. The second I turned eighteen I was outta there.

Since he lives so far away, and usually only visits my brother and sister once a year, I just have to make sure I'm not at my mom's place when he's in town. Since they don't really have a relationship with him, I'm not forced into having a relationship with him. It's not like I have to sit with him at Easter Dinner or anything. When I have Christmas he's with his other family. Those are experiences you would have to deal with that I haven't.
