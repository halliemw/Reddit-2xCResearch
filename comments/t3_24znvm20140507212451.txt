I have been on reddit for a long time. As it became more popular, I often felt attacked and bullied for simply trying to add to a conversation or give a different perpective on one idea or another. So I stopped posting as much and never revealed anything too personal. Then I found TwoX. I joined when it was still a pretty small community but I absolutely loved it. I finally felt free again to comment more freely, and give a little more of myself to strangers. It was so accepting and supportive. Just wonderful. It too gained popularity, but overall I would say the spirit of compassion and support for women was still a strong component of the sub. Please don't misunderstand me though. I'm glad there are new subscribers who might be able to add even more to a pretty damn good sub. But making TwoX a default sub is an obvious mistake. There are people who feel comfortable hiding behind the anonymity of reddit to tear others down for no reason at all other than their own amusement. This is in direct conflict of why this sub is successful. There aren't enough mods in the world to maintain the level of open and honest compassionate discourse that this sub once experienced. I see it even now in this particular thread! Unfortunately, by allowing everyone access it will alienate and silence the positive contributers. And that is very unfortunate.
