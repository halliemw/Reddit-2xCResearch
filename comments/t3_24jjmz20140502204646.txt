Pikes have gotta be Pi Kappa Alphas, right? They are the *worst* frat at any university, I swear. I'm in GA, and at GSU they were known (8-9 years ago) as the morons who wore blackface to a black frat's party (the theme was something about rappers--Pike's actions still terribly ignorant and awful); at UGA, the moron rednecks who tortured, killed, and ate a raccoon that had rabies. They got rabies, too, of course. At GA tech, they're the date rapists.

Why can't we abolish the whole goddamn frat?!
