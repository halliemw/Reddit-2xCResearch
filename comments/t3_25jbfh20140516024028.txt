If he said "good lass" would it have made a difference? I'm really curious.  Good girl/lass is a term of endearment in Ireland. He most likely wasn't meaning to hurt your feelings (I'm from Ireland and date US women). 
We have odd sayings like "cheers". It just means thank you and a drink isn't necessary.
