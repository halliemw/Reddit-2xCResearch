I don't think it's that simple. The way people describe it it's like the thought that they're doing something sneaky is like an itch. You want to scratch it, and if it's nothing then the itch will go away. If it's bad then you've got something gnarly to deal with. But it's not just like "passing thought leading to snooping=doom." We don't hear from tons of people who felt a little funny, snooped, found nothing, and then felt bad and lived happily ever after.
