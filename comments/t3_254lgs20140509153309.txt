I'm French Italian so I got my customary black chin hairs at 18. I'm jealous of your timeline. My body hair just keeps popping up exponentially from there. Plus I have nipple hair, peach fuzz all over my chest, hair on my lower back, hair on my arms, hair everywhere basically. Thankfully the majority of it is very fine and light blonde so it doesn't stick out too bad.
