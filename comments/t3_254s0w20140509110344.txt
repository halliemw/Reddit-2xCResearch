I can't say how much I love this:
>With notable exceptions, society is generally supportive of a girl that likes ice hockey or that is into computers. But a boy who wants a baby doll or plays with a kitchen set is still treated with suspicion and worry â€“ and they know it.

I see so many posts "my daughter likes programming" "my daughter working on cars".  Yay! Yay for a few select women being smart enough to do male things! I'm waiting for the day when "my son organized his sock drawer" or "my son cooked dinner" gets applause too.
