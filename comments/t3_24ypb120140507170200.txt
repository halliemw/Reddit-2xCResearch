Got my wedding dress. For ridiculously cheap and it was custom fit. My shoes were purchased at payless and custom dyed by them for free. Husband wore slacks from old Navy and a button up with a bow tie. 

As for the other expenses. We bought flowers from a distributor and made the bouquets and arrangements ourselves.  All plates and vases were purchased at various antique shops throughout town for less than 50 total. We had a cupcake tree it was the only food bought from a professional, my mom and I made everything else ourselves. The ceremony was free in the church we 'interned'  in, only had to pay our organist. We got a student photographer from our university, she did everything for 250. 

All told we spent about 1000 -  1250.
