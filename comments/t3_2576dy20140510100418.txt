It is the forced circumcision of little girls and young women that is the core of the issue. Some of the leaders of this movement are from these affected countries. Some immigrants from those countries illegally practice it in the US and other western countries. It is NOT the same issue, as male circumcision retains the ability to achieve sexual pleasure while female circumcision is the complete removal of the clitoris and at times and in some areas, the surgical sealing of the vagina until marriage (the frequency of such I cannot speak to). Check out the resources and information at [EqualityNow](http://www.equalitynow.org/) for more than what i can offer off the top of my head. It is not an equitable issue. It is not a matter of outsiders imposing their own beliefs. Young girls run away to avoid this. The imposed inability to derive pleasure from sex in cultures that then ignore women's choice on much broader levels (underage marriage, arranged/forced marriage, legal status of rape) creates the almost unavoidable potential of a lifetime of rape in these girls' future unless they accept their fate and "do their duty" to their marriage, which I would argue is a cruel life in and of itself.  It is a human rights issue, period. That there are women who support it as well DOES NOT make it right.
