3 reasons: 

1) TwoX sees itself as a "supportive" community, where members gather for emotional support rather than "rational" argument.  So oftentimes the OP will post some story for their life and most of the comments will just be like "you go girl!" even if OP acted irrationally or wrongly.  If you buck the trend and try to give more objective advice you are downvoted for not being "supportive." 

2) People here are generally extremely left-wing and unfortunately, very intolerant of opposing opinions.  Anything that even smells vaguely Republican, conservative, traditional, religious, etc... is attacked and downvoted with a mighty fury.  A lot of people on this sub came from those type of right-wing backgrounds and have a lot of resentment for those kinds of ideas and people and will viciously lash out. 

2) TwoX sees itself as a "safe space" in a reddit that it otherwise sees as misogynistic, hateful, "pro-rape," etc...  For that reason, people here see themselves at war with the rest of reddit, as in certain ideas and people.  When those people or ideas come here, they are downvoted as a matter of course, even if they are being respectful or making rational arguments. 

4) People on TwoX are very emotional.  Sorry if that sounds misogynistic, but its true.  A lot of people have suffered a lot of trauma and are quick to lash out.  This place also becomes a sounding board for very emotional topics like feminism and rape, so there isn't a lot of healthy discourse.
