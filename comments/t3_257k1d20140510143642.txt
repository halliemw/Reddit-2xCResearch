I have had a couple kind of antibiotic where the prescriber has warned me to use a back up birth control method.

Also, my pill does not say I need to use a backup if I miss a pill. If I miss TWO PILLS IN A ROW then I need to use a back up. Based on where I am in my pack it gives different directions, I think OP was being overly vague with instructions. I live in the US as well.
