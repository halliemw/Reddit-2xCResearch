I'm going to try to explain it, but I don't know if I can articulate why I disagree with you. If he had said, "I like the look of long hair", it would have been different. Instead, he stated "I like girls with short hair". As a chick, this is annoying. He is objectifying chicks with his language. And [we do think in language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h67k9eEw9AY). Also, the inference is that he would not like *her* with short hair. Did he make a mistake? Yes, but that does not make it okay. He did not acknowledge he made a mistake, and there's no repercussions to him for making a negative statement. So, she is left going "wtf" and depending on her personality, is left with a negative emotion to a positive experience, and he is likely to repeat this mistake. 

I don't know if you're a chick or not, but this is stuff I have to deal with on a *daily* basis, multiple times a day. It gets on my nerve.
