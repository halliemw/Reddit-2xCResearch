Dirt and dust get in there when you walk around! Sweat from your feet can kind of grind it into the shoe. The only thing I have found that helps (but maybe I just have gross feet!) is wearing loafer socks. You can't see them if you get the right pair but they make my flats more comfortable to wear and keep them from smelling or getting dirty so quickly.
