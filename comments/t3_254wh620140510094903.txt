I'll add my two cents here: as an active member of r/atheism, I was very upset when it was taken off the defaults.  At that time, /r/atheism was *flooded* with stories of former-believers who came to Reddit for memes and jokes, were exposed to atheist ideas and world-view because it was a default, slowly realized how silly and unfounded their own theistic beliefs were through the course of this exposure, and in the end became atheists themselves.

I believe, strongly, that all over Reddit, exposure to TwoX will be causing people to slowly become feminists through exactly the same process.  And while this necessarily means the quality of TwoX will drop and it will become less of a safe place, I think it will make Reddit in general a safer place in the long-run.  

Hopefully new safe places can be founded and used in the interim.
