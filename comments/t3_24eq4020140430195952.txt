Thank you! I'm reading expecting better now (yay kindle!) and it's definitely giving me not only a new perspective as a consumer of healthcare as a pregnant person, but as a part if the healthcare system and how I present procedures, treatments and medications to my patients.

I did call my OB's office. I have my first ultrasound next week, they said that they wouldn't really be able to tell anything until then anyways, but if I have pain/cramping/bleeding to call and go to the ED if it's severe. Since my health insurance sucks, even working for a hospital, I have to follow dr's orders and just wait. Probably what's best, but not what makes me feel completely relaxed. Gotta work on that on my own.
