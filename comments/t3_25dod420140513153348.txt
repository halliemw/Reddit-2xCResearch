Seriously, I found out Robin McKinley wrote a few books since I last looked her up and am SO excited to get them in the mail! She's possibly my favorite author. 

I find Harimad-sol and Aerin really interesting. They are clearly different women, but both of them are so strong and capable, it's really neat to see. Add Deerskin (Lissla Lissar) into the mix and you have a really cool demonstration of powerful and human women doing what they have to and changing their worlds.
