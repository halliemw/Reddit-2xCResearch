i think they're trying to point out that many people don't understand they've been sexually assaulted because they see that experience as a violent attack, like being dragged into an alley and raped at gunpoint. not understanding they've been raped means that oftentimes, they blame themselves and feel like they don't have the same resources as rape victims. plus, why would they report their rapist if they think they never got raped? so i think the article is about raising awareness about all the different contexts for rape, especially the less overtly violent ones (since those are most common).
