Wouldn't it be important to know the race and gender of the professors as well though? I mean, it makes sense that if the majority of these professors are white males, they would be more comfortable interacting with other white males. Clearly I have no evidence, but it does seem likely that if the test subject was with a majority Asian male population, that the individuals with the assumed Asian male names would be favored as well. This doesn't necessarily mean that women and those of a racial minority aren't at a disadvantage when contacting professors, but it seems more rational to explain this without assuming prejudice.
