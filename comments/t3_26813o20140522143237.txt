I don't think that people seem to realize that it's a complicated issue.  What you see on TV is a reflection of your culture.  Asking one TV show to change culture is a bit far fetched, but TV shows, as part of culture, are what eventually change culture.  

Also - when we talk about the 'outcry', we're talking about the vocal minority.  Who knows what percentage of viewers this represents.  I would suspect it's not representative of the viewer base.  People who produce TV shows are interested in the popularity of the show, and as this is a mainstream show, they're going to put in what the majority of people want to see.

It's not a 'defeatist' attitude', it's a complicated issue.
