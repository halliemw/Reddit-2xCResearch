You need to let your bosses know what happened and if he ever comes back, they need to throw him out. Also, it's not mean to stand up for yourself. I know we've all been basically conditioned throughout our lives to make other people comfortable at the expense of our own comfort, but you don't have to let men treat you like that.

My advice is do not playfully flirt with guys. I have a coworker who "playfully" hits on me all the time. At first I tried the be playful back, but turn him down thing. It just escalated from there. Now when he does it I don't even react. I just give him a cool, blank stare and wait for him to feel awkward and walk away.
