Talking about it? No, because I talk to people about weird shit all the time. Are you SERIOUSLY considering it? Yes, you are absolutely not making the best decision. I got married way too fast. I professed my feelings for this guy and a week after that, he proposed to me. Three months later, we were married. We had known each other for years, but we only sort of dated for months. It was one of the worst mistakes I ever made and I lost over four years of my life to a piece of trash. Please don't do this. You're young, you're naive, and that infatuation you feel now WILL fade. Trust me, it will and once it's gone, you're so new together that you don't know what's underneath it. You have your whole lives to make this decision, please don't rush into it and end up with bitterness and regret.
