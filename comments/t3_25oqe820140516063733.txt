This thread has been really interesting. When I read this comment, (I'm 19 and female) I was like wait....I don't agree...but when I thought about it, you're so right. Like I can name quite a few nights out with girlfriends where one of us has had a creep come up and harass one or more of us. And now I agree with you.
