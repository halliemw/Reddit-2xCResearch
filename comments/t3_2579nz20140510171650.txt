I've had this situation before but I was living alone and I didn't actually know anything about the guy beyond his first name - he was in one of my college classes and I checked over homework with him once for 15 minutes. I got this super long suicidal text with things like "I'm going to be leaving this world soon" because he saw me with my boyfriend. 

For me, I didn't have resources available like my parents to talk to his parents etc, but I called the campus police and told them about the suicide text and they went to make sure he was okay because I was totally freaking out and believed him. He left me alone after that. I think he realized that those manipulative texts can come with some serious consequences aka police coming to check on you. Also good, if he is seriously suicidal, he can also get some help. 

I'm not sure if police intervention is too extreme or not in your case - I called the campus police not the city police. Maybe parents would be better or maybe the police is the way to go - I'm not entirely sure unfortunately. Definitely don't just ignore the issue though!
