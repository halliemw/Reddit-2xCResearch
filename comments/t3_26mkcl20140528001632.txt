The legal process, if it takes places, happens outside of the workplace. The rapist still gets to go to work every day, sooooo... If the woman has to work with her rapist, they have to go to the committee to deal with the professional consequences of working with someone who assaulted them. (I've had to do this twice. It was as awesome as they describe it!)
