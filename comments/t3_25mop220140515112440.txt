You sound like my gf! I relate to jake a lot, this is a mix of anxiety and being too hard on himself.  

If he's beating himself up it's because he's proud - knows he's capable of better and holds himself to that standard (even if that standard is ridiculous.)

He's angry at himself for his mistakes and that's why he keeps bringing them up.

That is not depression. This can happen with depressed people, but jumping to a mental disorder isn't smart. Telling someone as proud as jake that they have a disorder isn't smart. 

I'm in a similar boat. 

I pay my way, write the news for a top ten market tv station, work another job and will graduate with a degree in tv reporting next week. But what's gotten me to this point is jake's level of self judgement.

A misspelled word or messed up video that airs will seriously ruin my night. It will remind me of every mistake I've made and every newscast I think I've ruined. That happens because I know I'm better than my mistakes and just blowing them off won't fix them.

Another thing-----

Jake thinks he should be able to solve everyone's problems and juggle the world without help. He thinks that's being successful. You need to let him fail, then talk him back up. He will learn he can't do it all eventually.

Some people, I think, need to be shown they can't carry the world. Telling them they can't will only make them want to prove you wrong.

 As a guy, I need my gf to believe in me, not diagnose me. 

EDIT: Also, there's no better way to make a person feel more inferior than telling them they have a condition. It's a bad stigma but a condition/disorder is seen by a lot of people as a weakness. PLEASE don't rely on anonymous redditors to diagnose him.
