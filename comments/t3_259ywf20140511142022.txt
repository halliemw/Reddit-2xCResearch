It happened to me.  Turns out, the bride's father got a hold of the guest list and decided I didn't make the cut.  *His* friends made the list, of course, surprising exactly no one.  :/

Whatever you decide to do, please understand that some things aren't up to the bride, no matter how it *should* be.
