You are correct, they are all different experiences and no more or less valuable/severe. Part of the issue I believe is the self blame, that I wasn't always the best person to her (having been a teenager) and that her constant manipulation made me think that all of this was caused by me.

Thank you for your kind words. I am lucky to have an amazing aunt and both my grandmothers to raise me, teach me, and that I am celebrating today. Enjoy the holiday as much as you can :)
