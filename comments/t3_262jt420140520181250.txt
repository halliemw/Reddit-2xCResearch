Wow, that's tough.  I'm not sure that anyone here can tell you what to do or make you feel better about either outcome.  It's a more difficult decision than I've ever had to face in my life.  I have the utmost respect for the thought you are putting into this, and I hope you find peace with whichever decision you make.
