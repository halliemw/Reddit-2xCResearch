Thank you. I think I needed to hear this.

It's just very difficult to make time for things other than work when all you feel like doing is sleeping off apathy and hopelessness. It's a chore to even go outside. My current environment is toxic to my mental health and I'm trying my best to save up so I can get out of it, but it's happening so slowly that sometimes I feel like giving up. And then I look in the mirror, and I'm only reminded of another reason why I want to go back to bed.

I'm just afraid of how much a psychologist is going to cost and of how any medication I might take will react with both BC and my brain. My mother had to be retained and hospitalized when she tried medication for her depression. The thought of getting so bad that I have to be hospitalized terrifies me.
