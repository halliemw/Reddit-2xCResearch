I had my first wax done with hard wax and although it definitely stung, I wouldn't say it was super painful. I went to a European Wax Center and enjoyed the experience, for the most part. I would recommend not doing your wax a week or so before your period--the one time I did, it hurt much, much worse than usual. I mentioned it to the esthetician and she said, anecdotally, many women tend to have more pain during the week leading up to their period. No real idea why. 

Hope you have a positive experience!
