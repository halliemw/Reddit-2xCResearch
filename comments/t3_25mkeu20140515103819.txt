Hopefully they don't have to touch it?  The people I hang out with usually keep their trash in disposable plastic bags.  On top of that, I usually carry extra toilet paper with me so I can wrap it up many times.  I have never *ever* left an exposed  tampon, pad, or visibly soiled toilet paper on anybody's trash.
