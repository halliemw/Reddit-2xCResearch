positive affirmations sound silly and idk if they really work but still, negative thinking has a huge effect on your mood and mental state.  If you start thinking and reacting positively to things, you can at least improve your mood, mental health, and self esteem.  idk about positive affirmations but positive thinking methods are  used in cognitive behavioral therapy.
