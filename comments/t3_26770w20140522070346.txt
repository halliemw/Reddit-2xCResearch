Oh no :( this sort of thing worries me. My husband is a teacher and he loves his students, but can be a bit unconventional and non-PC at times. He is a very new teacher and I don't feel he has the seniority to do/say some of the things he does... But it's just how he is. I only hope he doesn't get fired someday for saying something he shouldn't have. He also isn't in the English dept clique... The dept head hates his guts and is always talking trash about him. They're a very gossipy bunch, the English department...

Sorry about your job.
