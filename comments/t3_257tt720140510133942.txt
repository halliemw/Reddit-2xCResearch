I'm so sorry that that operation didn't work out as well as you'd hoped :( I wish you all the best with your recovery! 

Remember, medical nutrition drinks are your friend if you can't eat enough. If you're not lactose intolerant, the ones that say "yoghurt style" or "yoghurt based" often taste better, but either way they're a pretty convenient tool to increase your calorie intake even when you're not feeling up to eating :) (I have had to use them when I was sick, definitely made a difference.)
