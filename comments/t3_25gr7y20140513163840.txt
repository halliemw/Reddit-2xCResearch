Lot of people are saying she should just deal with going in for the follow-up, or all the reasons she should deal with it. But if she has enough stress and anxiety around this that she's ignored it for a year, that's something to address too.

I'd suggest she make an appointment with an ObGyn (or several) to just talk first. The follow-up tests and treatment, if any treatment is necessary, will probably feel a lot more manageable if she finds a doctor she can comfortably communicate with first.
