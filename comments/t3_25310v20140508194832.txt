In my humble but unpopular opinion, I don't think the perks are really a problem if they aren't mandatory. Some women, myself included, like to wear a little make up. I have acne scars and like a little color to express myself. I think a free makeover to learn make up tricks is pretty awesome for an office to do. I would feel more at home in an office that offered these fun perks, and time to bond with female staff (instead of the typical drama and gossip fests). But maybe offer a fun gender neutral alternative for people who don't wear makeup so it doesn't alienate anyone.
