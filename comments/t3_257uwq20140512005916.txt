The problem I see with business attire is that it's either ugly and ill fitting or tailored to fit/expensive. It would easily drape over a thin column body but if you have a disproportional body shape you will NEED tailoring. It needs a lot of care and mindfulness not to get ugly folds, not to get your shirt hiked up etc. These are clothes for people sitting at a desk, and doing minimal movement and carrying a handbag , not an active teenager who is lugging a 10lb backpack and needs freedom of movement. 

And this, on bodies that change continuously every year? 

Besides, the idea of a work uniform is changing in most fields outside the very conservative ones (finance, etc). In IT nobody gives a shit what you wear. Many "young" companies promote a free dress code to make workers happy and productive. 

If anything, I would be ok with uniforms, provided women were not forced to wear ONLY skirts (so if they had the option of pants or skirt).
