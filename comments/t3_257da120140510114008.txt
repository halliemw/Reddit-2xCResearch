Sorry, that was unclear. 

The issue with older men/younger women seems to start when both partners are in their 30s (or older). The issue with older women/younger men starts when the woman is in her 30s - while the man is younger. Basically, fertility becomes a concern earlier for women than for men.

I'm not saying that both aren't a concern, but for me personally, this was an issue because my (younger) husband was still feeling young and fancy free, while I had already been through that stage and was starting to become concerned about our ability to have children if we waited for him to 'catch up' to where I was, five years ahead. I was thinking about kids when he was just graduating from college and trying to figure out what to do with his life.
