This is quite good advice. The OP worried me, because it seemed she is setting up her partner to fail by insisting there is a "right way" to perform housework (read: her way) and she expects her partner to do his share of that housework. Sadly, part of sharing a life with someone is learning that if you want a task done a certain way, you're either going to have to do it yourself or remind your partner, probably repeatedly, of the way you want it done. 

For example, our hardwood floors: my partner is a swiffer-the-high-traffic-areas-once-a-day person, I'm a hand-wash-every-square-inch-once-a-week person. Luckily, our different approaches complement one another so we end up with fairly clean floors. But there are a lot of other different tasks that we each do differently, and the more of those that we each can let go, the better our domestic life is. Sometimes, you have to look at a drawer full of t-shirts folded the "wrong" way and just pick one out.
