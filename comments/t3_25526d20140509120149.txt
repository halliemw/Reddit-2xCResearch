I played Runescape for years and I would often play with one person in particular. After about 3 years of playing at least once a week with this person I guess I said something to him that made him twig that I'm a woman and he just Freaked Out. After that, all he wanted was pictures of me and would say vile things to me. I stopped playing RS and had to change my email address to stop him contacting me.
