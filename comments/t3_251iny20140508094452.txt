For me, this is a tough one, especially if you already set boundaries prior to it happening.  I honestly think that if you're doing something that you'd be hesitant to tell your partner about, that it's probably not the best idea.  I can't imagine (even without a conversation about boundaries) that someone wouldn't recognize chatting, flirting, and trading pictures with opposite sex strangers online to be potentially inappropriate.  So, I am kind of doubting this naivete theory you've got going.  I lost my virginity after I was 20 and haven't had a ton of long relationships, and honestly, that doesn't make someone unable to decipher social cues or make them suddenly inclined to disregard the mores of established monogamous relationships.  You know your boyfriend better than any of us, I am just saying that isn't a good justification for behavior.

I think If I were in this situation, I'd want to understand *why* it happened.  Are you guys not spending as much time together?  Does he feel unappreciated?  Are you just not communicating very well?  Does he feel insecure about his looks and wants more compliments?  It's probably best to communicate about it and understand why he felt the need to cross an already discussed boundary.  I also think you should revisit the conversation about what is expected from each other in the relationship and what constitutes inappropriate behavior, if you really do believe that he is that unsure or incapable of recognizing it.
