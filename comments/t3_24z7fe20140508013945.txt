This here is the issue, the subtle infiltration. I've already found myself several times today halfway through reading a comment here in twox and realizing, "...Oh. This person is not on feminism's side." It's wasting my time to have to wade through comments that subtly work against the women-oriented perspective of this sub. Obvious trolls can be downvoted immediately, but many people are more nuanced than that and will inevitably destroy this sub's legitimacy as a safe space.
