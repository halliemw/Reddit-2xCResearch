Blah I've noticed that in work sometimes (but other times not) and it annoys me. Although I would have to say that the vast amount of job postings I've looked at are like "must be able to lift x amount of weight" with no gender specifications. When I worked in the restaurant industry, I was always a bit annoyed when the place I worked at expected women to not carry the heavy things and left it to men. You hired me because I'm competent, so if I need a new keg now, I'm going to get it. If the tables need to be moved, I'll pick them up and carry them. I'm not going to let someone else do my job for me. But thankfully, most jobs I've had don't have different expectations like that. 

Someone might not agree with me, but I think views like "women aren't physically capable of doing this, let's lower their standard" is really problematic and doesn't do anything to help women's equality. There are plenty of men who are weak and incapable of doing a job (bell curve distribution - with mean's as close together as men and women's strength there's a LOT of overlap), and plenty of women who are strong and capable of doing a job. Gender shouldn't even be mentioned in the criteria, ability to lift/carry the necessary weight or whatever should be.
