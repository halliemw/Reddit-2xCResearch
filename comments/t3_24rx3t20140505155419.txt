I don't know. I was in the geek culture pretty heavily before it became popular. I don't think "dude-bros" are the problem. I think the popularity is the first problem, and then a number of social problems that existed before, but now have a greater voice due to the internet.

You still had boy-men that called girls that weren't interested in them bitches and sluts. You still had them falling all over a girl at the DnD shop, only to talk about how much of an attention whore she must be because she wasn't interested in the game that they're interested in.

The only real difference is now there's a war over the space, because the space is popular, there's a war from these outcasts wanting it to stay an outcast space. It is easy to point at "women" as imposters because it's easy to identify them as different. But in reality, it's all just about being exclusionary. The second difference is that there's an anonymous space to breed these opinions.
