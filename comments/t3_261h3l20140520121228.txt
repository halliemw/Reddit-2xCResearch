Have you already tried seeing a therapist? I'm not implying that there's anything wrong with you, but maybe this need of change is a product of some deep fears? I'm obviously just guessing since I don't know you, but you often see these types of thoughts with people with such problems.

But most important, do you really want another boyfriend or are you just afraid that staying with one person will stop from making changes in your life, or that it will make your life dull?

If it's your boyfriend you don't see a future with, I can't say much to that, but if it's the second option, this is totally untrue! It's totally possible to have a boyfriend and move regularly, change your hair/clothingstyle, you can try new sports together, or other activities, visit cities you've never been to before, try and travel to new places every now and then,...

If you'd ask me a relationship requires you to make a lot of considering the others opinion when it comes to decisionmaking, but it definetly doesn't restrict you from change or discovering new things. In fact, aren't experiences like these better when shared? Obviously one great condition for this to work is that your boyfriend likes this point of view as well and that this fits his mindset, but that up to you to two to discuss of course!

I hope my advice was useful to you! Good luck!
