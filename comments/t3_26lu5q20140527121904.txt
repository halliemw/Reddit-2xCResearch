Fuck yea helloily!! We're all going to be old and droopy one day anyway, lets just enjoy ourselves now and take comfort in the fact that we're doing something we love. I think if you feel guilty for eating a certain food it turns into a forbidden fruit of sorts, you're more likely to eat it and then hate yourself for it. There's no point.
