It is interesting what gets covered in history and what doesn't... I had an amazing US history teacher when I was in high school, and what I remember most distinctly was that when he taught women's history and  Native American history, we never touched the textbook. There were just no details there. Women got the right to vote but never mind hunger strikes or years of campaigning to get it or the role of alcohol politics in the controversy. Just the facts and just the most positive reading of the outcomes without any of the dirty details. 

The author mentions that the civil rights movement is taught much more completely, but admittedly they scrub that one up a bit too. At least they do admit to some of the violence that took place. I do remember that the section on the Black Panthers was pretty much false, though. Not to mention attempts recently to remove terms like "slave trade" from textbooks.
