I did keep my career initially.  My friends were shocked, my family very disappointed  but that changed once the baby arrived.  My son is my fathers side kick now.  Best buddies really.  
I'm married to the babies father and we have had ups and downs but it's pretty good now.  
I don't believe in soul mates or anything.  We get along mostly, love our kids, and care about each other.  It's enough.
I gave up my job about eight months after my son was born.  I really liked motherhood.  Much more than I had imagined.  I really thought it would be a burden.  I eventually started a business of my own that let's me strike a pretty good work family valence and I love it.  Honestly, my. 19 year old self would be SHOCKED at my life now.  It's nothing like I planned, but I guess that's how life goes.  I'm happy with it though.  It hasn't been easy, but I wouldn't change much.
