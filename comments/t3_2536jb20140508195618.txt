No my doctor was a total shit head and wouldn't answer any of my questions, literally rushing me out of his office. He told me it was foe "mood swings." I thought webutrin *was* an SSRI.

Unfortunately my insurance leaves me very limited with choice in pyschiatrist. And thus the saga of bad doctors continues.

It was like I was just a "crazy" to him, not an actual person. I didn't want to spend any more time with him than I had to. Plus the coldness he exhuded was pretty intimidating.
