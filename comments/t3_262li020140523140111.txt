Caring about issues is an adult thing, i'm sorry to tell you. Most teens and children don't worry about life issues cause they are still children, enjoy it while you can cause once its gone its never coming back. Finding something insulting and being insulted are two different things. When you can figure that out, you will be well on your way to wearing what you like, when you like. Cheers!
