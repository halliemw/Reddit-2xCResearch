Yes, as many people here are saying, having benign lumps of dense tissue is fairly common, and as u/ArrghPirate says, called fibrocystic breasts.  I'm really surprised that your doctor didn't say anything about that.  I had 2 ultrasounds, a mammogram, and an MRI to check mine out when I found a "lump" (which went away after about a year).  You might want to start seeing a different doctor.  My doctor even had a pamphlet for me on what fibrocystic breasts are, but still took every precaution (just short of biopsy) to check for cancer too.  Always better to be safe than sorry!
