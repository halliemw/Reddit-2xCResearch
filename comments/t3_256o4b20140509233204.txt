I'm not sure where you are at but if it's around, you should look into visiting a planned parenthood facility.  Based on what I have seen they are way less judgmental and opinionated that your doctor seems to have been.  I know a lot of women who use the IUD, particularly the non hormonal one and have never had any problem.  They have never had kids and are under the age of 25.  All of them have been happy with the results.
