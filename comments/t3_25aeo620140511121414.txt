I had a similar experience on my campus. Except the Saudi guy literally straddled my leg and rested his gentials on my leg whilst I was sitting in the otherwise empty bus shelter waiting to go home. I reported it to my security team and didn't take the report further as it wasn't on cctv.

Report the incident, to your building manager, they could be thrown out of their accommodation or even school for doing so.
