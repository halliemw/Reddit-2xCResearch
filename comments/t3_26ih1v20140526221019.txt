I don't see why number of responses should hold any significance. More responses doesn't necessary mean better discussion. And no one is saying you can't talk about ethnicity.

However, right now the discussion is centered around a different ethnicity, or actually race. That doesn't disqualify your experiences, it just means that's not what's being talked about right now.
