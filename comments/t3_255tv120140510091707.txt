Unfortunately not, because there is no recorded evidence of abuse and he was acquitted in court, it's unlikely I would be successful in obtaining an injunction. I have a friend who is a police officer and is willing to be around if my ex needs to come back to collect anything etc, and he's told me to call the police if he turns up unannounced.

I live on my own so it is a slight concern, but I (perhaps naively) don't believe he would come here to hurt me. I don't answer the door unless I know who it is, and I make sure everything is properly locked up and secure at night.
