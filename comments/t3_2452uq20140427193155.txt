Different doctor, and make sure they know it has been there for over a year. This is a case where persistence pays off. Also, if it's getting inflamed, see a doctor sooner rather than later so it can be treated before it gets bad enough for the ER. It's less likely to be ignored if it's not behaving like a benign annoyance as well, so you might find that you get the treatment you want and need more easily now that it's becoming inflamed.
