I have to agree. You need to talk to your SO. The clearest takeaway I have from this post is that you are ready to be a mother now and he is on the fence about being a father. You need to discuss this with him regardless of what the test reveals. If he is not ready for children, you need to be supportive of this if you are going to continue to be with him (meaning if you're not pregnant, use a condom, don't wait for him to put it on, you may have to put it on yourself.)
