> They are doing it because they are assholes, plain and simple.

No and that's a dangerous claim to make, because sooner or later she'll find out that even a guy wiht the most creepy stare is capable of more emotions than mindless lust and then that whole argument falls apart. You'll either get a girl that thinks even nice guys are complete assholes or a girl that thinks all assholes are potentially nice guys and you really don't want either.

Painting the world black and white like that is a horrible idea and will always  backfire in the end. Self-defense classes are a much better idea.
