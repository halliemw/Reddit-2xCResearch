I know this may seem silly, but maybe leave your wife some poetry books or art supplies. I'm a pretty private person, but my art is a way to express myself and connect to how I feel, without feeling SO vulnerable.

And if in those moments when she needs you, she picks up poem, perhaps she may develop a personal and private love with that. Art has wonderful healing powers. And wonderful stories to relate to that might help her.

But that's just from my own personal experience. Other than that, maybe you could buy one of those journals from Barnes & Noble or something that asks you to list all your favorite things, places, etc. It's silly, but I'm sure it'd be nice to have a little book all about YOU.

So very sorry you are going through this. Know an internet stranger is sending you and your family lots of love during this time.
