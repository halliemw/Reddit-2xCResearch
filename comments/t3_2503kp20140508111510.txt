Oh I agree its likely over, but I don't think its him being vindictive or laying an intentional ultimatum.  Maybe he thought he could handle it, but when faced with the reality he simply can't.   I don't see how stating your preference, and the expected reaction is "evil" or "bad".  He's not the horrible bad guy, he's a person with his own feelings and responses to the situation.

Its realistic.  Sounds like both of them handled it as maturely and responsibly as they could.
