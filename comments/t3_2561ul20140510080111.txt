I found, after losing my father, that it doesn't get better in the sense that it hurts less not having him around but, rather, the surprise of him not being there goes away.  Once that surprise was gone I was able to remember him happily instead of wanting to cry whenever my thoughts turned to him.  That's a great picture to have and one I'm sure you'll give a prominent space somewhere.
