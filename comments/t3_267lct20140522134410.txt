For me it just feels like the difference between *Madame* and *Mademoiselle*. The former is used as a polite term to show respect to older women, and is also used for any woman who is married, regardless of age. So, *ma'am*, to me, feels like *Madame*, which just feels off.

I suppose it also has something to do with society and wanting to feel younger, etc. I can see how "Yes ma'am" just sounds better than "Yes miss", but something like "Excuse me, miss" doesn't sound off. And of course with titles, I think "Miss" is almost always preferred unless someone is married. I don't know. It just makes me feel... old, to always hear "ma'am" and never "miss" or "young lady" or whatever.
