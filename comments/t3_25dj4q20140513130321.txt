I think you are misinterpreting what I said, perhaps I was unclear. I am not sure how to explain this differently though.

I am explaining the rational and the broader context behind the rational people use to justify their "self entitled" actions. You are not wrong that he is a "self entitled asshole", but then why do the friends support him? This is why. 

It's because they do not understand that embracing a people and their culture does not mean you have to embrace every aspect of their culture. Popular gay culture has some facets that are simply not appropriate in the rest of society. Take it from someone who participates pride parades and the Folsom Street Fair every year. It's a lot like the whole loud and proud thing where some gay people will wear overly sexual and revealing S&M clothing in public. Some assholes and some nostalgic traditionalists who otherwise are not assholes will fail to see, or refuse to acknowledge how these are not appropriate, and some overly enthusiastic people will encourage or embrace this kind of behavior without thinking.

There was at no point any generalization, and ironically you seem to be rather quick to dish out negative labels.
