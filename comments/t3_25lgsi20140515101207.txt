Sorry to hear about that. It was very difficult. There were times where I always wondered what he was doing, would he cheat, etc. But that's where complete trust comes in. I trust him, so that helped my conscience in whether or not it was the right decision to continue. LDR's are all about trust and the feeling that they'll always be there. Good luck with everything though. I hope it turns out well for both of you in the end :)
