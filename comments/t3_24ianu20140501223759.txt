Yep. They have some degree of anonymity. Sure you know what they look like, but you're just some broad walking down the street. They get a sense of power when they can treat you like a sex toy and you just walk on by. That's why people yell from the safety of their car when driving by. It's not just sexism either, just general rudeness. They feel safe. 

So yeah, they absolutely don't even register you as a human being that can affect his world. You're just a pretty thing walking on by.
