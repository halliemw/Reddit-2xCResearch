In the UK, our guidelines say you can happily take antibiotics on contraception. If you're being treated for TB you should be careful. Specifically about rifampicin. 

Please let anyone involved in caring for you know you're on contraception when they ask about medication! 

We also have different missed pill rules for COCP, depending on where you are in your 21 days. 

I would suggest keeping the leaflet you're given with your prescription so you can check when you're unsure.
