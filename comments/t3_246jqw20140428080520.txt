I think it's an issue of motivation. I can be the laziest, slobbiest ass in the world, but if I think someone will think badly of me for not doing something then I suddenly become the hardest worker in the world. 

My boss thinks I'm a perfectionist and reliable because I've never missed a deadline or let him down. My boyfriend thinks my apartment is clean. My friends think I have an active social life. 

In reality, I'm just too scared they're going to find out that I rush everything last minute and that if they weren't around to see the (lack of) results then nothing would happen. Ever. 

So yeah, motivation via avoidance of negative consequences. It kinda works.
