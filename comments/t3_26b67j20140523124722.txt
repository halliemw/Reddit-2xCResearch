My Mum only put her wedding ring on after my Dad died, and only so that she didn't get rude comments about not wearing it. It was a diamond solitaire, and I think she found that it got caught on things and the stone became loose. 

I wear mine, but it and my engagement ring are totally flat so not a problem. I have waggled that hand at men who are too persistent, or when there's no language in common.
