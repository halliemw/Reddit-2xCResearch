There's probably a couple of reasons.

>too much drama and bitchiness

Try not to go in to friendships or friendship groups with this hanging over your head. You may be unintentionally giving off a closed off or even pre-emptively hostile attitude because you're nervous about coming up against it from the other person. 

>the girlfriend never likes me and my and my friend lose contact for a while until they break up.

Maybe a few reasons: are you flirty with your guy friends? Maybe you are without realising it. Or maybe those girls are just insecure or jealous. Unfortunately there's not much you can do about that. But maybe see your friends girlfriends as a way of making other girl friends. Reach out to them, see if they want to hang out with you independently. This might help them feel more comfortable with you while also helping you make female friends.
