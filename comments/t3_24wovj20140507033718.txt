So maybe the phrasing in the article could be changed to reflect the way you kinda said it: that drinking to blackout makes you more vulnerable to any crime, and dressing in a way the local culture perceives to be disrespectful will open you up to crimes motivated by anger. Then you just note that in certain locations "modesty" is considered part of respect. Everyone wins (except the rapists)?
