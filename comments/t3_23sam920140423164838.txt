Regarding hospital debt - it's totally negotiable.  Call the hospital billing department, and explain that you do not have the money to pay that bill, and won't in the foreseeable future.

Negotiate a lower balance with payments that you can manage.  They know that you can default on the bill, declare bankruptcy, and they'll get nothing, so something is better than that.

Good luck.
