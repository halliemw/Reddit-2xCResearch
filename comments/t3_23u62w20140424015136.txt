My issue is calling around for a female doctor. I hate to be sexist but barring a very few male types, I cannot possibly allow anyone else to view what few people have before. 

Three people have seen me nekkid, one was my mother. While seeking help for my mental stability and the problems therein it was pointed out to me that it might be easier, at least while I have my health, to 'shop around' until I find a doctor who suits my fragile trust state.
