I know you don't mean to be mean, but I know gorgeous girls who have body image issues too. Just because someone doesn't look like they should be insecure, doesn't make their feelings and struggles to love their bodies any less real or valid. It's something everyone has to deal with. What needs to change is society, and we shouldn't hate on each other.
