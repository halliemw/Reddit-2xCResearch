I used to be the laziest of asses, oh man. I'd come home from work and just kind of vegg on the internet until bed. The source? I was depressed - primarily because I hated my job/had a lousy BF, and didn't realize either of those things. I didn't want to clean my apartment, or cook dinner, or exercise, or even really do the things I enjoyed, like read or write or play video games; I came home without two brain cells to rub together.

And then I got a better job, one I love. And when my lousy BF was dismissive of my job as "not 'real' work," I dumped him. And now, when I get home from work, I go to the gym for a bit, or do yoga in the living room; I cook dinner or reheat leftovers, and rinse my dishes instead of piling them in the sink; I keep my place tidy, and do a big clean on the weekend; I spend at least a couple evenings a week out with friends. And I am so, so much happier than I ever was before.

Something in your life could be draining you, the way my job and relationship were a drain on me. If you can pinpoint the source of that and change or remove it, you may find you have the energy you need to live the active lifestyle you want. Good luck; I hope you're able to make the change you want!
