I barely have any symptoms, and what you're describing could be a UTI. Next time you pee, pay attention to the smell. I know it sounds weird, but if your urine stinks and smells like anything but urine (unless you've been eating asparagus or something) that's a pretty sure sign of a UTI, though no smell doesn't necessarily mean no UTI. It's quick, cheap, and easy to get a UTI diagnosed and treated, but once it becomes a kidney infection it's miserable, painful, and a lot harder to treat. In general, when you suspect a UTI, it's best to go to a doctor, basically any clinic or urgent care will do. All you have to do to be diagnosed is pee in a cup, so it's not like it's invasive or anything, and the appointment should be cheap even without insurance.
