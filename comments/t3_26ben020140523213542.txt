That's a good article, and I salute you for being inclusive of usually overlooked situations, like abused men and same-sex couples. If I had one recommendation however, perhaps it would have been good to expand on non-physical abuse, as it's much harder for people who are victims of it - and for those who perpetrate it - to see it for what it is.

Congratulations for being published!
