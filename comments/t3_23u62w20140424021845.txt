It depends how sick you feel. If you don't have any particular health concerns then its no big deal. It is a good idea to get a physical check up, some routine bloodwork and so on. You're 20's is generally the healthiest time of your life, so its good to have a baseline record of your health so in 20 years time if you feel sick they can compare it to your health now.

Personally I think there is nothing wrong with not seeing a doctor. Its your body and your health and you know your own limits. There are diseases that you can not detect yourself some some routine tests like Pap smears or such can detect early, But you will know better than anyone what your true risk category is (Family history, poor lifestyle, etc).
