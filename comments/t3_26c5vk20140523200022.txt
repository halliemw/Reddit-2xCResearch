He shouldn't have touched you while you were sleeping. It doesn't matter what happened afterward. You were vulnerable and he took advantage of that fact. What I would do is talk to him about it and say, "Look, I know this happened afterward. But I was thinking about it and it's super fucking creepy that you were feeling me up while I was asleep."
