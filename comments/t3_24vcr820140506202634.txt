5'2" lady over here. I'm 18 and my peers (and those younger and much older) comment that I look like I'm a grad student and think it's hot. I mean... Ok but no. But then I get the comment that I look 15 from older (mid 20s mind you) guys and think that's pretty hot too... Kinda gross you think I'm a hot 15 year old when you're 24 ish...
