Let me start with: I apologize for the shitty username. I cannot create a new account or switch accounts, because I'm on a shared IP and any attempt to log in is met with "please try again in 4 hours", so I have to go with the account already signed in.

I think that's very true, but I don't see how it relates to the rights of the accused. Wouldn't the solution here be investigating the gang rape, something that can be done without announcing who someone is before all the evidence is in? I don't think advocating for investigating crime requires attacking the rights of the accused.

You can (and fucking should) be for investigating the gang rape, AND for investigating the stabbing AND for not starting witch hunts. Like it or not (and I would hope not), accused rapists are vilified before they are found guilty. That can lead to innocent people come to harm. That is not okay. It isn't made okay because they're fucking up in another aspect either. It honestly worries me how many people are willing to throw away innocent until proven guilty if it's an crime that elicits an emotional response. Do people no longer believe it is better to let a guilty person go free than punish an innocent one?

I think it's a shitty sign that people are rallying around "yea, fuck the rights of the accused." instead of "fuck not investigating the rape." It's focusing on the wrong part, and really counter productive for justice.

I know some people would argue it's just a joke, and not a serious attack on the rights of the accused, but isn't that the same principle used to justify rape jokes and rape culture? There's no reason the jokes or statements need to be making jabs at the rights of the accused, when they can focus on the actual issue, which is the lack of investigation into crimes that damn well need to be investigated. The solution to injustice is not to support a different brand of injustice.
