Before my husband and I started dating, I shared an apartment with my dog only. I also work with dogs so I didn't interact with people much. My best friend lived two hours from me so I drove to visit her once a week or so. I mostly did whatever activities my pup and I could do together- biking, hiking, swimming, festivals- or I stayed home and sewed or baked or watched movies or whatever. Pretty much whatever you normally do with friends I was content to do alone, and I didn't feel lonely. I'm pretty introverted though. I know lots of people hate doing stuff without friends.
