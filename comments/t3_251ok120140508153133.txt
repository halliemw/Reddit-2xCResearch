I've lost more karma in this thread than I ever have in my entire time on reddit. But, hey, transparency, right? 

I know the two ideas seem at odds. The best way to put it is that it's much easier to have several very in-depth conversations with five people than 170,000. There was a lot of hesitance in the decision. Sort like... teaching your kid how to ride a bike and then letting them go around the block by themselves.
