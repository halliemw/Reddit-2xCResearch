I understand where you're coming from, you're just severely overestimating how often I go outside.

Two days out of the week maximum. And only once each day. I do everything online. Work from home, do school stuff at home, email is my friend.

I basically only leave to buy food. Maybe hang out with a large group of friends once a week. Or to take test (but I always take my tests at a place 10 minutes away from home and I try to take the quiet street there). Now that I type it out, it sounds even more pathetic. Wow.

I know you're right in a way and I'm making excuses somewhat. It is worse in my head because it's built up.

I should say that it does happen literally 100% of the time when I go grocery shopping, and it did happen every day when I worked not from home. 

The journal thing is a good idea though. Writing here really helped me. And I think it would feel good to write "no one bothered me today" some days.

I have this goal for myself to get myself outside at least once a day. Even if it's just going downstairs and standing in the parking lot for a minute. 

I'm gonna do the journal thing, and the entries will be a lot of "I stood in the parking lot today and no one bothered me" but it's a start haha
