I find it disgusting when the man spits on the woman. I see this a lot actually. There is also a difference between sexy ass slapping and you're a piece of meat ass slapping.

Edit: I just want to clarify that the spitting thing is a huge turn off for me because I find spitting on someone on of the most disrespectful things a person can do. But hey, different strokes for different folks.
