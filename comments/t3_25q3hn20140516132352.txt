Long term, likely soon to be former, reader here. I've been here for a few years but have been participating less as the function of the sub has gradually shifted towards being a place to foster perpetual outrage. The fact that the mods shadowbanned my submissions (other than comments) doesn't help my opinion of this place much, either.

My view on defaulting is that it's caused far too much polarization.

There has been an obvious influx of troublemakers who are either posting for the lulz and/or have psychological problems up to and including rectocranial inversion. These people are mostly dealt with by the moderators. People like this are the background radiation of the Internet and dealing with them is just a part of being online.

The other side of the coin has been the reaction of the college feminist contingent to outside troublemakers.  Their reaction has been to use the influx of troublemakers as a pretext to step up gender-based hate speech and silencing tactics (mass downvotes, abusive PMs, etc) against posters who do not accept their viewpoints. These people have largely been ignored by the moderators and have made the community toxic.

There's no longer a welcoming community here. It's been replaced by a war between the kind of easily trolled young women who see rape, misogyny, rape, street harassment, and rape, everywhere and the kind of (mostly) young men who wind people up on the Internet for the fun of it.
