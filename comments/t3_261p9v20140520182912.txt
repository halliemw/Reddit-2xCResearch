I agree, that'd be an inappropriate way to solve the problem (e.g. to ignore that there is a problem with the way boys are participating in early schooling)- and it's definitely not mansplaining- it's something feminists (and I know I do) should certainly consider an imperative topic. 

I think what is problematic (and I wouldn't want to use the term mansplaining since it's not really accurate in this context and unnecessarily pejorative and condescending) that she's trying to highlight is the idea of equating the wage gap with women's tendencies to be less competitive than men and then explaining this "tendency" as something that's natural and inherent to women.  That's what the article she links later is positing-- that sexism basically plays no role (or if not no role, then an inconsequential one) in the resulting wage gap - and that there is nothing sexist about assuming women are naturally demure, naturally anti-competitive, naturally less demanding of an equal wage (so why should we give them one, and why is it a problem).  Which is obviously hog-wash. Even if there are tendencies on either side of the gender line (which is debatable given the state of nature versus nurture research into gender roles), to base compensation on gender because of gender tendencies is still discriminatory of diversity in a workplace.
