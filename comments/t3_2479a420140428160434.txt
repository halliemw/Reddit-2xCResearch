This was my favorite part of the article.  And to me, it crystallized two questions which I think have been nagging at me for a long time:

1. What is the appropriate feminist response to a feminist encountering a man at each of these stages?

2. Which level does a man have to be at, before feminists should be willing to let him participate actively in the debate without being mocked or 'downvoted'?

I can certainly see why inviting someone at any level below 5 to your debate would run the risk of derailing or slowing down the discussion, and why it's therefore tempting to mock or exclude them.  However, if 95% of men are somewhere in stages 1-4, is this really the best long-term strategy?  And if not, where does the responsibility fall to change it?
