Screw OSHA. OSHA is a baseline. Go above and beyond that. Bungees, ropes, bull horns, buckets of rubble or brick at the feet, anything to make that ladder SAFER. My buddy is paralyzed and I have 19 stitches in my arm  to prove how dangerous it is. Most falls occur getting on or off a ladder. If you have any concerns, back down. Seriously, be careful on ladders.
