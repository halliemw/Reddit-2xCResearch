What about an employer, do you think it's ok for a company like Walmart to refuse to hire any women who won't agree to sign a contract agreeing to terminate any pregnancies where the child has a high risk of being developmentally disabled and/or where the child is determined to be disabled in utero? What if they just require women to sign a contract agreeing to terminate any pregnancy, regardless of disability status, as a condition of being hired?
