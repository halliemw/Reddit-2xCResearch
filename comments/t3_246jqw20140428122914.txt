I'm improving slowly. The key was baby steps. I do 30 mins of "chores" (housework / study / exercise / etc) after dinner, then the rest of the evening is mine. It's made a real improvement, and the more small victories I achieve, the more I feel motivated to get more done. Also, the hardest part is starting a task. Once you've started, you often find the will to see it through. Don't think of the mountain, just think of the small step.
