I think there's a disconnect in how you define "men" and how the people who like the hashtag define "men." To them, the word "man" includes a certain amount of respect for the person you're calling "man" based in their maturity, general character, experience, etc., while to you it simply means "adult male human." So for them, saying real men don't do this very bad thing is a way of expressing contempt for this way of handling their problems (namely insecurity over women becoming educated and possibly some sort of masculinity crisis or something), not a way of saying adult male humans don't do this thing so they must be monsters. I also suspect the hashtag isn't intended to put direct pressure on the people who bought the girls, either. It's meant to put pressure on more powerful people to send the message that this sort of behavior is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. After all, I highly doubt that the men who did buy these girls care what a bunch of powerless Western commoners think about their actions. What matters is that our leaders theoretically care about what we think, and they have actual power to cause problems for these men.
