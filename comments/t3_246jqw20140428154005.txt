Hey thanks for responding. I was beginning to feel like a real loser for struggling so much. I think I've been bogged down by people who's attitude is clearly it's not a big deal because it's "only" 5k. It's nice to hear from someone else not finding it easy. Your attitude, commitment and results are impressive. 

Well done on completing your 5k!!!
