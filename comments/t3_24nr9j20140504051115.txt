Damn sorry. Hopefully you learned something from this. I am your age , and due to many misfortunes , had been staying with my parents again until last year. For some of us , it doesn't get any easier. We may harden , get sour , or rebound like crazy, but this is life. In all of it's beautiful, unforeseeable , experiences, you only have one. Don't spend it stressing. Much love!
