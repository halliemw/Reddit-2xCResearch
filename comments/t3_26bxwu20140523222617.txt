Guuuuuurl! We all have horror stories about being catcalled, street harassed, etc. It sucks and no matter how thick skinned you might become, some days do get ruined because of jerks. I wouldn't accept a job in that neighborhood based on your experience.


As for defending oneself, I can tell you from living in DTLA for a few years *before* the whole rejuvenation project crap, it was bad during the day and unbearable after dark. And any time of day, no matter where I went, I used to get it from every angle. Even when I moved to NoHo, when I walked my daughter in a stroller, covered up in layers with no makeup, I couldn't walk anywhere without the honking, cat calls, kissing noises. If I needed something at 7-11 at night, I would dress up like a dude and walk like a dude with my weapon in my pocket and chunky rings on all my fingers - still got honked at during the two block walk. Like, really bro?  How could you tell I have a nice ass through the 3x sweatpants and hoodie? I got off course there.... Anyway, what I'm saying is solidarity and what happened sucks. I hope this doesn't deter you in the job search <3!
