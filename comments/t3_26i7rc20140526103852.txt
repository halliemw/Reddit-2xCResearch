I mean, I know they say only 4 were legit, but I posted in that thread that I hadn't received any insulting PMs and then I GOT AN INSULTING PM.

So I hit the "report" button in my mail. That admin thread said they are not counting reports made via the report button, only reports sent to modmail. WTF! Why would the "report" button not count, but mod mails count towards the totals?
