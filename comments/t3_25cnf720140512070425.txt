Appearances do matter. Its a fact. I can feel the downvotes coming. I would try something like " I am radiently beautiful and vibrantly healthy" beautify is not only outside it is inside as well. I am sorry you are suffering. Dont let the world hurt you. Who determines your worth? Its not them. Its you. Be in charge of how you feel. There is nothing wrong with thinking happy thoughts. It works!
