Why not? However, there are a few things to think through.

1. Like others have said, pick a classy place. Look into if there are safety routines (e.g. bouncer escort from club to your car) in place, what their policy on actual prostitution is and if they allow clients taking photos/video.

2. Think it through. Could this possibly hurt your career later on? I know it sucks and is stupid, but there is still a stigma around stripping. Some professions do not look kindly on it, would it surface. This is of course also dependent on where you live but please consider it at before hand. 

3. Be realistic. Stripping has lately been painted in quite glamourous light. But just like being a MD can be mentally taxing or being a freelancing journalist is though there is the other side of stripping too. You may meet a lot of men who treat you like crap, you will meet women with very sad stories and quite possibly drug addictions. The extent of it will vary depending on the club of course, but it doesn't hurt to keep your guard up.
