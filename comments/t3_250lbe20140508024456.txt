Here's what I do when I want strong curls: blow dry my hair, apply a holding gel (maybe what I should say is a mousse?) to my dry hair, comb it through so I don't have big chunks of crunchy hair, then curl. If I'm feeling smart I spray my hair with heat protectant before I dry.

You could also use a hair spray. Anything that is meant to hold hairstyles.
