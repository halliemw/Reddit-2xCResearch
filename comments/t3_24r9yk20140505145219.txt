>If you can communicate effectively, you are capable of consent

Not necessarily so.  Alcohol affects different people in different ways, and the faculties for informed decision-making may be jettisoned earlier than the faculties for communication.

It may be different for people in a long-term relationship because, when alcohol is involved, the question becomes "is my partner making a decision while drunk that she wouldn't make while sober?"  And people in a long-term relationship can usually judge that pretty well.

But if it's somebody you don't know well, then you can't make that judgment.  And your partner can always get past this by giving you blanket consent--*while sober*--for hanky-panky to happen when she's drunk.
