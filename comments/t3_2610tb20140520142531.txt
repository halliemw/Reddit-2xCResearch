One of the hardest parts about breaking up with someone who treats you badly is the wish for justice, or at least some sense they acknowledge they were an ass and that the breakup will at least make you feel better about them being a jerk to you.

The problem is that if they were capable of that level of self control and introspection, you wouldn't have had an issue with them in the first place, and breaking up is just a step to stop them from injuring your further, it doesn't undo past hurt.
