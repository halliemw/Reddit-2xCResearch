Ok, so just spent an hour over on abrathatfits. Awesome!! Thank you folks sooooooooo much for the advice to go there! There was a ton of great information their, and  best of all, a ton of folks just like me :)

Also, I learned to measure better and got tips on how to do it accurately. I wen  into the bathroom to measure in front of the mirror, which was a recommendation to get the tape placement right. Apparently I was also holding the tape way too tight in all the measurements across the bust. I guess I thought the tape was supposed to be pulled snug, when really it's supposed to just be touching at all points. The snug measure is the UNDERBUST measurement, not all of them, lol!

So, apparently I'm a 28G :0 !

But you know something...I don't care. I saw dozens of posts over there from women who were the same size  or bigger, and all proud off it. I feel so much better! It's amazing how finding something on the net can completely change your thoughts.

But...I still have the problem of getting the right bra, and, well, mom.
This sounds stupid, but I'd almost rather talk to my dad. He's a great guy, and has always been awesome, and  I know he loves me (I'm his little princess). He's just not around much since  he got promoted at his job. 

So, do you think my dad will be weirded out if I bring it up with him?  I love both my parents, it's just that mom and i have been a little prickly for the last few months. But, I couldn't stan  it it if I made dad that way too by talking to him :(

Oh, an  I need to say thanks for all the wonderful posts since I was away reading on abrathatfits!  I'll do that personally tomorrow, going to bed now, but THANK YOU!!!!!!!
