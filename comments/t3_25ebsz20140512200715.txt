DEFINITELY second guess it. When I started, I wanted to be an academic... and a semester into it, I realized that I wanted to go into industry. Sometimes I wonder if I would be happy with the MS but nah, I really do like learning. Research has its ups and downs but if you honestly HATE it, I would really re-evaluate your situation. My boyfriend was in a program that wasn't a great fit for him and he left for a different one. His happiness now vs. two years ago is drastic. 

I think personally, for me, I am starting to see all of my friends get engaged/married/start lives, and I am in year 4 of an LDR (1 more year left hopefully) ... its hard to see people move on with their lives where I just feel like a slightly older college student sometimes. (Or maybe just older... not really slightly older anymore! Eeek)
