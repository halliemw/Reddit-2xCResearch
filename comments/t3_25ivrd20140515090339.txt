I know, I think that's why it upsets me in this essay so badly.  It took me a year to stop feeling guilty for all of the abuse "I caused" in my marriage.  This kind of manipulation is the scariest kind because it is so sneaky.  My husband wanted "to help me be a better person" so that we could get a long.  He was super kind and loving, when he wasn't breaking my things, insulting me, stealing from me and hitting me because of all of "my flaws".  And it happened little by little with escalating abuse, but by the time the abuse was obvious and ridiculous he had broken down my self esteem to the point that I believed it was my fault that I couldn't make him happy.  Writing it down it sounds ridiculous or like I must be stupid, but it's true and I'm not.  When I finally cut him off, he broke into my house, stole my laptops, cash, gun, jewelry, trashed my house and knocked me unconscious with a gash in my head.  And told me it was my fault for not just letting him see me, so he wouldn't have had to go so far.  Fuck that shit.  Sorry for the wall of text.  It's good for me to talk about it.
