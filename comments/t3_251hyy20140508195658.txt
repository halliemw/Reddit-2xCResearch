Yup. Here you either have the baby or risk your health (and possibly even life) in an unsafe abortion. And it doesn't matter if your baby is severely disabled.

You can also give the baby up for adoption, but to be honest there's almost no info (on the internet or wherever) for mothers looking to put their kids up for adoption - at least, when I was pregnant, I wasn't able to find almost ANYTHING. There's no such thing as an open adoption like in the US; when you sign away your parental rights it's over. You don't meet the parents either, your child could be in the limbo for all you know. Also most of the time they want the kid to stay with their biological parents; to my understanding putting a child up for adoption is hard to do (law-wise) but I wouldn't know. The other option is finding a couple and signing over your parental rights to them... sometimes they don't even do background checks for those and children end up abused (was on the news some weeks ago).

Edit: Oh and, abortion in Uruguay IS legal (up until 12 weeks), but I don't think an Argentinean woman can have one done there.
