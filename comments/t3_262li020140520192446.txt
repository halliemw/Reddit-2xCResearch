> You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. However, the teachers and school are paid to lead you to water. Its their job. Your feelings on the matter don't come into it, nor should they. Also, a "surprising number" of your friends isn't surprising. Your friends likely hold the same views you do.

Their job is to prepare us for life. While this may include preparing us for later etiquette such as dress codes, the fact is that it isn't having the desired effect on students. So why still include it? Also, my observations are not of my "friends", just people who have gone to my school and transitioned into high school that I have been aware of (in fact, many I never talked to). So no. I don't know what views they hold.

> "All I'm saying is, if you're going to try to get me to follow the rules, you better keep your eyes on me from when I'm 12 to when I'm 18 and you longer are allowed to". This is all self-control.

Are you trying to say that my views excuse us from self-control? If so, that is incorrect. Actually, it will teach us more control to not have the dress code because then we are the ones who have to decide what is and is not appropriate in society (and don't have to depend on an outside source to do so).

> Unless you go to an all girls school, or you're omitting details on the poster, it can be taken no other way than "Boys are the reason this happening and they think nothing of you besides wanting to have sex with you."
You may not have made the posters, but you're putting your signature on this message, so you better be ready to defend it when people start asking you to.

I posted here so I could get an unbiased opinion on how to improve and validate our message. So that's something I could suggest to everyone.
