I'm glad that you realize your value as a woman and a person, and I'm glad that you feel comfortable identifying as a feminist. That's great! I am genuinely very happy for you.

But as a lesbian: girl, slow your homophobia down. It's 2014. You were afraid to identify as a feminist for fear of being mixed in with the likes *me*? Rude.

Lesbians are not a terrifying monolith of hairy-legged gremlins hell-bent on cutting off penises. We don't hate men; we just don't want to fuck them. That's not hate, that's just sexual orientation. Most of us are quite nice, fundamentally. Some shave our armpits and some don't, but you know what? *It literally doesn't matter.* What other people do with their armpits shouldn't bother you. You do what you want with your armpits, I'll do what I want with mine, and we'll all have a good time! 

That's feminism: the freedom to choose what you want.
