A gift off of the registry is typically best, but don't feel pressured to buy anything you can't afford. Most people put $10 and $20 items on their list for people who don't have a lot of money or are students or whatever. 

Couples typically create registries to make gift giving easy and so that there aren't multiples (ie., 3 blenders) or mis-matched dishes, that kind of thing. Don't feel like you're a disappointment if you just come bearing dishtowels or something. To them, that'll be a sweet gesture *plus* they now don't have to worry about going out and spending money on dish towels after paying for a wedding & honeymoon :)
