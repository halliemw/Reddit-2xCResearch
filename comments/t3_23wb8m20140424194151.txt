I'm in the midst of laser and I love it. I'm pretty pale (mostly german/irish) but with dark hair (yay 33% cherokee) and it's been great. I barely have any armpit hair after 3 sessions there and I just started on my bikini line. It wasn't painful down there, less so than the armpits so I'm going to upgrade to a full Brazilian.
