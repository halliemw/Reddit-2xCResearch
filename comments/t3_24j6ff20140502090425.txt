My dad worked from home for a long period of time when we were growing up, and it was the best! For one thing, my dad let me get away with way more than my mom ever did, but most importantly, it's just nice to have someone there when you get home from school and tell about your day, and they have to listen and be enthusiastic about it no matter how long and boring the story is. 

I owe so much to my parents, they have put us first without a doubt since our(me and my siblings) first days on earth. I know a big part of that is eating dinner together, at the table, I don't think people realize how important that time is.
