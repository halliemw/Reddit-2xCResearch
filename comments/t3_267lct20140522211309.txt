Live in the South, I have been called ma'am since I was 16 or so.  It's more of a formality than a judgement on age.  If you don't know the lady, you call her ma'am or you're being forward and rude.  I got hit on once by a young man in a truck who hollered "Ma'am, you're awesome!"  I was 19 in some very tight jeans.  I only get called miss by old men trying to make feel like a child (in my late twenties).  Don't even get me started on "sweetheart"â€¦just awful.
