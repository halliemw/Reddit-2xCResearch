There are a few problems with the "not all men" response to feminism (obviously this depends on the context - from your comment it is difficult to tell if the comments people were making were feminist and promoting gender equality or not.  If not, then this doesn't really apply as the article and rhetorique about the "not all men" reponse is in regards to its usage as a response to feminism).

1. (Which the article raises) It can be and often is used to derail or delegitimize the substance of the argument, when the substance of the argument is not that all men do that thing. If the writing is about someone's personal experience or a phenomena (male privilege, rape culture, the patriarchy, etc...) the fact that not all men are like that is totally irrelevant to the conversation.  For example, if someone is discussing the fact that men take less responsibility for caregiving of the elderly, saying that some men do holds the same weight as anecdotal evidence and paints the feminist as the bigot.

2. It shows that the person raising this as a counter point is not versed with the issue at hand.  I read a lot of feminist writing and rarely, if ever, have I seen anything saying that every single man on earth is a certain way.   That, simply speaking, is not the issue feminists are attempting to address.  

3. It allows for a man to feel no social responsibility towards the issue of gender inequality. (I don't objectify women; therefore, I'm not a part of the problem and my job is done.)  This ignores the fact that men, whether they are active sexists or not, benefit from the patriarchy.

But, in general, I would say that this response is so often non sequitur in nature.  Feminist speak to phenomena and men respond by pointing out exceptions to rule as if this a valid counter-argument.  Clearly, not all men do this, but that is also clearly not the point I'm trying to make.
