I'm not the original commenter, but that happened to me with four different guys. ):


My way of dealing with it used to be feeling guilty, but after my guardian found out about it (when I was freaking out, I was about 16) she phoned the police to do a welfare check. Dude wasn't on a cliff, he was in bed. After that you learn to call the police each time it's threatened, just in case.



Edit: forgot to mention something. Two of those guys were friends of mine, one was a guy I broke up with (I found out he'd cheated on me), and the fourth was barely an acquaintance. Sometimes, people can be manipulative jerks.
