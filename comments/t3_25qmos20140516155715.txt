The major scenario in which I would be cautious would be if you are a smoker - the risks of blood clots etc from birth control are particularly elevated in women over the age of 35.

It will not influence your [fertility](http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/1398.short). You may see a short term delay prior to conception, which basically translates to it might take a couple of cycles until your body returns to usual fertility. This is not influenced by long term vs short term contraceptive use.

Some studies suggest that women who take oral contraceptives are at a slightly [increased risk of cervical cancer](http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09513590.2011.558953), which decreases after discontinuation. The WHO weighed the risk/benefit and does not recommend a change in oral contraceptive use due to this effect, and recommends instead regularly screening and HPV vaccination. On the other hand, oral contraception [protects significantly against ovarian cancer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm199808133390702), including ovarian cancer in women with a pathological BRCA mutation. It seems [breast cancer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013202) is not correlated with oral contraceptive use.
