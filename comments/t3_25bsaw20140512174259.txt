Cannot argue with Bill Hicks... except perhaps his health choices. Children are a blessing and a curse. To love something outside of yourself so much is actually terrifying. You would die without question for them, but you may never get that choice. Ironic, after you wrested that choice for yourself. Suddenly you have the potential for more pain than you ever thought possible in your life, unimaginable. unthinkable. and now you actually feel guilty about dying, because of them. bah. 

Old age sucks. but like the proverbial frog in the boiling water, it is not always obvious until you are unable to bend over to pick up your glasses, which you cannot see without your glasses.

As for dying with dignity, well, it sends a message. I dunno what that is, but life is not always sacrosanct. That sounds like a prison we make for ourselves. If the universe wants the last laugh, you could always have locked in syndrome. try killing yourself with only your eyelids.
