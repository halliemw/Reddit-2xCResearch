 Never assume, because you make an ASS out of U and ME. 

I do not think it is the girls fault and
I'm not saying I think it was morally correct for them to do such a thing, I'm saying the girls could have taken the matter into their own hands.  When did I say anything about it being morally right?  What i am getting at is instead of recognizing it, and practically making it viral, they could have ignored it and disregarded it entirely.  Now, someone, somewhere is getting a laugh out of the fact that someone pulled something like this, and god knows those kids are going to be in college someday, bragging about a "badass" thing they pulled in high school.  If no attention was drawn to it, the entire idea of the prom draft would be disregarded by everybody.  It won't be remembered, instead, it'll be a stupid idea some kid had.
 
Its a situation that should have been ignored until it goes away.  Don't give it attention because that's what high schoolers (especially jocks) want.
 
And yes really, a girl could just say no.  It would fucking smash the kid's esteem and confidence in the draft, and in doing so, discouraging anyone else from going on with the draft.

 
And the "encouragement" comes from the attention, getting a reaction is what satisfies these kind of people.
