Don't stress the down votes.  Reddit automatically assigns downvotes as a measure to thwart vote bots.  Also, there are people who will downvote posts on a default sub just because they can.  And sometimes it's just a hand/eye coordination fail.  I know I've accidentally hit the arrows before when I meant to hit the icon to collapse or expand a post in RES.  (Reddit Enhancement Suite)
