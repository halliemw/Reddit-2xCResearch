I think you are looking to take issue. You have either extremely poor reading comprehension of what I am saying or are choosing to ignore what I am saying and replace it with what you think could allow for confrontation. Where are you getting that I made generalizations, where are you getting that I said that gay culture says it's ok? I specifically illustrated how it isn't ok, but became somewhat of a common practice. It is a practice that is not acceptable particularly now that the gay rights movement has progressed to the point it has. I explained this quite thoroughly already.

Why would they be confused as to what is acceptable? Why would they listen to him? What reason could he possibly give them that is believable?
