I know, that's terrible, right?  We know three of them dug themselves out and Popcorn was one of them.  He never liked the hole during the day much.  

He knows how pretty he is so he much prefers laying in  the sun while all the students take pictures of him and throw him treats, etc.  He lets no one approach him, though.  Just me and the professor who feeds him regularly, so what I think at this point is that it was done intentionally, very early in the morning with the purpose of trapping them there.  Cause once he is out of that hole in the morning, he usually doesn't go back until very late at night.  Two or three are still missing though, which is heart breaking.
