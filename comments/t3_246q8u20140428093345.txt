I don't really have advice other than trying to see her at work or school or whatever she does where she'll be alone, but I just wanted to encourage you to not give up on this. It seems like she might really need a friend right now, and I hope you find a way to get through to her and give her whatever help she needs.
You seem like a great friend.
