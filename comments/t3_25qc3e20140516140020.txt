Just as a comment: the main point is I want to wear high street shirts. I appreciate the idea of tailored shirts but I'm looking for a way to wear high street shirts, not where to buy other shirts. That is why I suggested something to reduce my boobs, not alternative clothing stores. But keep up the helpful advice!
