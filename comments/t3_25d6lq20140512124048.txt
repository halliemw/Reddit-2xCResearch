Thanks! This is definitely helpful, and advice I was looking for. As far as answering your questions, we have talked about getting engaged...what we each expect/want, timelines, what each of our priorities are, those types of things. That's how I can say it is going to be a "surprise, romantic, bended knee traditional" style proposal, because that is very important to him. It's less important to me, but I know it will make him happy. I think taking time to reflect on *why* is a really good idea. I know that there must be more of a reason and the keeping up with the Joneses thing just sort of exacerbates it all. I really appreciate your answer. I'm going to use your advice and check out this book!
