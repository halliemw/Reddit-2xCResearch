Yeah, there are a lot of problems with this idea of 'drunk sex = rape'. 

The ideas behind this are good in theory, but poor in execution. First of all, it implies that two drunk people are raping each other, since neither of them would be able to consent to have sex with the other. Second of all, there are varying 'degrees' of drunkenness and there is a difference between being happily drunk and enthusiastically consenting to sex and being blacked out drunk and not even knowing what's going on. 

Since the likelihood of people just stopping the practice of having sex while drunk is not going to go away, I think we are better off educating people so that consent is always highly on their minds and also bringing awareness to the need to keep an eye on your drunken friends when they are about to sneak off to have sex. If the person they're going with looks too out of it to really realise what's going on, then step in and stop them much the same way you'd stop a person from driving drunk. The lack of the latter is the real problem, in my opinion - people tend to assume consent or willingness to have sex instead of being of the opinion 'better safe than sorry'. 

What we really need to work on is building acceptance and support for rape and assault victims, AND try to stop the stigma surrounding regretting sex while drunk (guys feel pressure to feel that any sex is good sex, women worry about being viewed as whores who couldn't keep their legs shut, etc). We also need to work to combat the idea that it's okay to ply someone with a few drinks with the intent of getting them to have sex with you if they wouldn't while sober. No. This is not okay. 

It's all a very tricky, touchy subject but I don't think blanket or umbrella terms help at all.
