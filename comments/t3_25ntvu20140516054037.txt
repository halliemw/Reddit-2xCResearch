Yeah I have to agree with this, the problem with gender activism I have noticed from both feminists and MRA's is the tenancy to surround themselves with reasons why their movement is necessary. This includes "Sky is falling" articles like you mention, one of the reasons I like TwoX is the general response to those kind of articles is "This is click-bait, and a exaggeration of the real problem and not worth our time" (At least it was before the sub became a default).

Don't get me wrong, societal problems exist for both men and women, but the internet exposes you to the *worst* of it, when in reality most of the people out there are good people, or at least try to be. 

The problem is; activism needs to a "Call to arms" so it will inflate its statistics, bias it's reports and fill your mind with anxiety and fear because it wants to force you into action. And of course, if you kick a dog enough times and eventually it will give up and accept the beating, same goes for activism. Value the world for it's good, there is plenty of it out there, and if you don't feel there is enough? then make some! The best way to change the world is to set an example, not police the behavior of others.
