Did you know you can do research outside of an academic setting? I work for a very large government run mental health program in Canada and all of our researchers only have Bachelors degrees. Their boss is a doctor (PhD), but they are not. You are out of your league and you need to stop. I work in this field. Judging by your comments, I have to assume that you do not.

This isn't where I work, but just to show provide proof that you are making things up:
