>Not necessarily true. Various stats on comic readership show 20-40+% are female. http://comicsbeat.com/market-research-says-46-female-comic-fans/

I think this still makes OP's statememt true. If women aren't in the majority in comic readership, then they are not the primary demographic. And given that we don't have the data on the sexual orientation of those women, there may me a percentage of them that enjoy the over sexualized artwork.

>So we should teach them through example that its OK and normal to depict women this way? Wouldn't that also skew their views of women overall when its a common problem in all media?

If we're leaving it up to the media to teach our children anything, then we're already failed. My parents taught me how to respect women, not some comic or TV show. 

>When men are featured, they're not half naked in physically impossible poses like women often are in comics. Its a false equivalency.

They don't have to be have naked or in physically impossible poses to appeal to young teen women. Companies don't tend to market to women often through visual stimulation since women aren't as easily visually stimulated as men are. They do it psychologically. The target young women's emotions, fears, and insecurities. Have you ever seen a fat girl in a Victoria's Secret commercial. Nope. And you won't. You'll see the type of women men typically want to see. Not because they want men to buy underwear, but because they want women to think they can be just as appealing to men if they wear the same thing.
