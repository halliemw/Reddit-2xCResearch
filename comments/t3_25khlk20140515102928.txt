Most middle-aged men I meet will cut me off mid-sentence, or try. If they raise their voice to talk over me, I speak up. I don't interrupt them when they are mid-sentence, and I've given myself the same courtesy by adding a few decibels. Some walk away after realizing I don't want to be spoken over. My father, at least, has adjusted to not cutting me off.
