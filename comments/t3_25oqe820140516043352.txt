Guy here (one of them newbies this is aimed at).

Thank you for this. I cant speak for the rest of my gender but as a fairly big guy myself its sometimes so easy to forget that life for a woman is so insanely different.

Most of the time i can walk down a street late at night, see someone passing by or following behind me and not give it a second thought. Having been in rough areas though i know what its like to have to be constantly aware of the people around you.

Having to live like that almost all the time no matter where you are must be maddening.

This was a good reminder, so again, thanks.
