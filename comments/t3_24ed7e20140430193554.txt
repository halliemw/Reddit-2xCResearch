I did, in fact, ask him to stop. Beyond that, I set boundaries before I drank, telling him that, no matter what, I did not want to have sex while I was drunk. I was drunk for the first time, and he was sober, and suggested sex. I was staying in his home, which was literally in a different country than mine, and three hours from the airport. I blame myself for putting myself in that situation, but it also means I had no safe way of leaving. 

I'm not sure how he could have thought what he did was what I wanted, or even just plain an okay thing to do. But I guess I could have fought him physically, even though he was bigger than me and pinning me down with his body weight.
