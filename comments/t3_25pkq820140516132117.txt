Omg this is me. I started when I was 18 and have been going on and off. I'm 26 now, finally full time, and I'll be graduating in two years!  I've been through a ridiculous amount of stuff that has held me back, so I know when I finally walk across that stage I'll be bawling my eyes out.  So congrats to you!! *high five*
