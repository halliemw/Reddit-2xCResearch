Hmm my brother has seizures (not sure if it's a genetic thing) and some weird stuff has been happening but it's been hard to tell if it's normal weird or weird weird. 

I was going to get drinks with some coworkers this week (yay finally found some chill people at my job!) but when they told me they were doing a happy hour thing I had to back out because apparently you can't drink anything while on it. UGH.
