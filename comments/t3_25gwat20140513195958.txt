That doesn't make it ok, no matter who he does it to. 

As to him not realizing it was you...
Do you think he'd start fucking his mom or his sister if he had passed out next to them?  

He's not your friend, no matter how nice he was before. You have every right to be completely angry and feel totally betrayed. I'm glad you're talking to a counselor. It sucks but some of your friends don't understand and have no concept of what going through something like this is like, & they may say cruel or thoughtless things because of it. It's not your fault, you literally did nothing but wake up groggy and confused. He did all the doing, without your consent. Saying it's your fault is saying he had no control over his actions or should take responsibility for them, which is bullshit. 

Do what you have to to take care of yourself and heal, even if that means ending a few friendships. You'll be better off without jerks who blame you for am assault you didn't nothing to provoke. Good luck
