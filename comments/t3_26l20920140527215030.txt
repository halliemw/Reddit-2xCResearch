I do not think this would consider a rape, because the OP engaged in making out at the beginning and he/ she never said no verbally or non- verbally.
I totally agree that not saying no, doesn't mean yes. However actively engaging in kissing  while the other person  is about to open your pants is non- verbally saying yes. OP started to make out with this friend probably very passionately thinking the person is the crush. When OP realized he / she is making out with the wrong person , he / she stopped being passionate and decided to lay down and let the other person actively continuo without ever saying no verbally or non- verbally. OP was NOT passed out, OP was NOT sleeping, OP was awake and conscious the whole time. Still OP never gave any indication that the sex is not longer welcomed anymore, there was no pushing hands away, no pulling away etc. 
This incident  doesn't seems to be a rape,  it sounds like a very bad drunken decision.
OP feels bad because the sex was with the wrong person , not the person fault, not because this drunken sex happened.
