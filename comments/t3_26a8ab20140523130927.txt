Me having drunk sex is me performing an action.
The point made above that I replied to was that I can't consent to sex if I'm drunk. I can.
If I'm passed out or too drunk to speak - then yes I can't consent. But I've been drunk many times and only have been that drunk a small fraction of those times.
My point was, that simply being drunk does take away my agency to give consent. Being paralytic drunk does. Hence my car analogy. If I'm sober enough to try to drive home I'm sober enough to give my consent as an adult.
