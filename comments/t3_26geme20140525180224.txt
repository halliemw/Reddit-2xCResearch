I think that's where the disconnect comes from in one word: _failings_. I'd reasonably expect someone who was close to you, that is like an older brother to you, would be concerned for your mental, emotional and physical well being. Assuming he does care for you, he probably thought he was (rather bluntly, as evidently is his style) asking about the difficulties you were having, with all the intent in the world of being supportive. However, since you perceive these matters as _failings_, concerns sound just like criticisms.

This is a pretty typical when one is struggling with challenges and failing, particularly if depressed. It's so hard for people who aren't experiencing it to understand that what they think is being supportive is experienced as just the opposite. It makes it tough for everyone.

**EDIT**: For the record: failures aren't failings. It's hard to internalize it, but maybe start with understanding that those who care about you definitely don't equate the two.
