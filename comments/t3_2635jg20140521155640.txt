Gyno first diagnosed me with several other things with treatments that didn't work. Then I went to the gyno again for a follow up after a treatment hadn't worked. I had recently had sex so when I went I had a UTI which makes anything inserted even more painful. He did an exam and it hurt A LOT. Then he said that with that pain and the UTIs the likely cause was a stressed/weak pelvic floor so he sent me to a pelvic floor therapist and it's helped greatly with my UTIs so far.

EDIT: forgot to mention that before I had dyspareunia I would get UTIs after sex very frequently. Which is why he misdiagnosed me a lot before doing an internal exam and finding out that it was painful on the inside, not just from lack of lubricant :p Also said that while he was doing the exam my muscles were involuntarily spasming
