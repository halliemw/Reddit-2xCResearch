I think what I really hate about the "virginity as gift" metaphor is that virginity is a complete social construct. There's no actual medical definition of virginity (i.e,, does anal sex count? oral? Hymens break all the time for non-sexual reasons, so that's out. Digital penetration?). So these metaphors unnecessarily place this ambiguous concept of virginity on a pedestal, and there's no need to treat it like that.
