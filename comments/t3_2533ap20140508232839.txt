I'm another guy, and I'm not sure it is something that you can demand to be explained -- but I'll try. From where I'm standing, girls hear all the time from guys that they need to do certain things to be attractive: dress in feminine ways, shave their body hair, have thighs that don't touch, grow their hair out, and probably even more I don't know about. It is very real and I've heard it before -- overheard men saying things like, "girls shouldn't have short hair." So when a guy is expressing a preference for a certain body type, it's only a hop and a skip away from this culture of attempting to control women's appearances. Please feel free to disagree -- but let me know if this sounds right.
