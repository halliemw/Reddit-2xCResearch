Haha - I may have been unclear. They planned to have a small official wedding now, and then a bigger celebration/party sort of thing in a year or so. So it wouldn't even be a wedding. I can't really say anything about it now, it's a bit too late to do anything. What upset me more was that she didn't even tell me she was having bridesmaids and I had to either find out online or turn up on the day to see it
