I realize this is anecdotal, but I've never had any problems emailing my professors, and the majority of them were male. 

I wonder if several very biased professors could be skewing the study,  there could be several different variables changing the results. Anyway, whether this is true or not, I hope this study does not discourage women from higher education.
