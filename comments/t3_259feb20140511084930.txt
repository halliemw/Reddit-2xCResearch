Constantly work on her self esteem but not by giving her a bunch of empty compliments.  If she doesn't have some talent she can be proud of take the time to find out what she's good at and support her in that.  Be loving and a good example.  Talk, talk, TALK about everything, good and bad.  Give her a good set of morals to judge herself and others by.  (not the really harsh kind, we don't want a hater either, do we?)  Take every opporunity to talk out situations.  My 10 year old daughter and I have talked about the character Barney on How I Met Your Mother and how he acts towards women.

Whatever you do, don't go into hyper overprotective parent mode. You won't raise a self assured girl like that and you need her to be able to make good decisions when in those tough spots and all on her own.

There isn't anything you can do about the environment at her mother's house except listen to what she has to say and how it makes her feel.
