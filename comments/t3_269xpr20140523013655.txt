For me and my SO communication is really important, we always try to be reachable by each other (via text, skype, etc.) and this makes us feel a little bit closer. Its also really important to deal with problems in a relationship as soon as they come up because we've found distance tends to magnify the issues, so we have a few words to set up a 'safe space' type thing where we can talk about issues and feelings in the most objective and unaccusatory way, it takes practice be willing to try again. Trust is also really important, my SO likes a lot of physical contact for reassurance and I can't be there for that, so I understand how other people (whom i know) might supply that. 

edit: if possible try to always know when you're gonna see each other next, it makes it easier.
