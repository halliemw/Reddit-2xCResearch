When I had friendships with guys that felt like they might want more and I wasn't interested - I would go for a while hanging out with them in groups and not taking opportunities that came up to spend one-on-one time. I generally like to be more direct but if they haven't actually made a move or asked you out, saying "in case you were getting any ideas about this - I don't want to date you" is um, awkward. But the approach of making sure it was group hangouts worked pretty well, one of the guys checked in with my best friend - "so I'm pretty sure she's not interested, am I reading this right?". And then we all relaxed again. 
I have also awkwardly and briefly dated guys I wished I liked "that way", and have rallied from those situations to have some long term great friendships with guys. Things can be awkward. Shrug. That's kind of just people. I'm sure most of us have done feasibly embarrassing awkward things around the people we like most!
