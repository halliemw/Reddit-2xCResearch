Oh I got SO fucking mad when we were car shopping and I was continuously being ignored or talked over. Constantly passing test drives over me in favor of my boyfriend, berating my driving when I managed to test drive ONE car (the one we ended up getting). I have been driving longer, have gotten into zero accidents, and my boyfriend is the reason we had to get a new car in the first place.

Salesmen didn't realize that I had no problem using my walking away power. People really were singing a different tune when they saw **me** budgeting everything out and my boyfriend looking to me to make decisions. Ended up going to a dealership that acknowledged me, and surprise, we left the lot with a new-used car for 3k less than our loan amount.
