I know I'll never be friends with my mom either. She's a fine mom, but she's been extremely judgemental,  and more or less has taken my brothers side when she learned he sexually abused me.

I can spend time with her, I just can't tell her a damn thing about my life. which upsets her, but its her own doing.
