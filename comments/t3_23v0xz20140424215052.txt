> but I didnâ€™t want to be rude 

so one thing i've realized, and have been assured by many men, is that **you have to be a little rude sometimes**. frankly, after a while, they're just asking for it-- again, words other men have told me. not wanting to be rude or mean to people has put me into so many situations that escalated much more than they should've.

you don't have to tell him why. after the second why, i probably would've turned on bitch mode. you don't have to talk to him if you don't want to. just tell him, "i'm sorry, i'm in a hurry," while you pull out your phone and call a friend/family member. tell them where you are LOUDLY, you're walking to your car, and that you should be home shortly. stay on the phone until you feel safe again (in your car, driving away, pulling out of the lot)
