Abnormal psychology student here. First off I want to say in no way am I trying to prove anyone wrong or call anyone out.  However,  this doesn't sound like major depression to me. Major depression causes other very serious things along with low self esteem. Things such as low energy (he works out every day), low appetite, the averse to this (over eating), hopeless. Most of all these types of things would have to affect his everyday life for more that two years and not going without any of these symptoms for more than two months at a time.  

The only reason I'm saying this is because telling someone that they have depression or that you think they do can have very serious consequences.  
To me this seems that it may just be self esteem issue in itself.
