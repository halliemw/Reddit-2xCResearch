It's totally weird.  I mean, I am completely weirded out by the fact that if we had sex right now (as in, I have all the fertile signs right now), we could potentially have a kid, for reals.  I will probably feel different after the first few times we give it a shot on peak fertile days and still fail, but at the moment it's still very, very weird.  But transitions are supposed to be weird.  Just have to ride it out.  

I want kids but am very ambivalent about the being pregnant part.  I'm afraid I won't react well to the major physical shifts and I'm setting myself up for months of misery.  So that's been fun.
