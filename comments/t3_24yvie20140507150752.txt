Yes, OP. Creating that paper trail is very important should the harassment escalate (like more social media accounts of yours involved, getting strange calls, people possibly contacting your employers or lecturers etc.). 

It was a very wise step to go about the "reporting it immediately" way. Not many people dare to do that.

As a next step I would advise you to think about any other accounts you have that need securing.

* set twitter to private  
* change passwords on email accounts?  
* change last name on facebook to something else/obscure
* google the username you used on instagram. is anybody maybe mounting an open attack on you in some discussion forum?  
* use an image reverse engine (drag and drop your instagram pictures into http://images.google.com) to find possible spots your instagram pictures might already have been uploaded to  
* delete very private or face-revealing photos on instagram. Trolls just love that shit.  
* drop hints about that strange online harassment when around your friends so they slightly know what's going on without being too alarmed  
* have a nice cold drink ;)
