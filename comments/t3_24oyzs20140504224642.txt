I saw that there is a female red pill subreddit.(r/redpillwomen) I checked it out because I was genuinely curious about why a woman would ever buy into the redpill thing. At first they seemed reasonably open for discussions.   But if you are REMOTELY critical of red pill men they delete your posts and even ban you. It's ridiculous.
