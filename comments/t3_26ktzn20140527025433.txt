They make women's basketball shorts too. They're roomy as well but will fit average women's bodies well. I'm currently wearing some and they stop just above my knees (about 1cm above). They're very comfortable but incredibly difficult to find since most sporting stores only carry super short shorts for women.

Also super roomy if you can find them are [soccer shorts](http://www.adidas.com/us/product/womens-soccer-tiro-13-shorts/TU856?cid=X58028&breadcrumb=1z13071Z1z11zrfZu3Z1z13xgj). Both sports require no pockets so fingers and hands can't get caught on them, so it's one way to make sure you've found the right ones.
