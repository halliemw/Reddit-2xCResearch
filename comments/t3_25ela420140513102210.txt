Neither of my babies would tolerate a cover. At home, where almost all of the feedings were done, I didn't use one. So, suddenly putting a cover on them to feed upset them. They would break from the breast and sit up and try to push it off. I'd have milk squirting everywhere plus an exposed breast plus a mad baby. I think my experience with covers is common; a lot of breastfeeding moms can't use them.

The cover thing reminds me of [this Luv's commerical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgmbJso-2-o).
