"Thank you for inviting me to the administrative professionals appreciation day lunch! It means a lot that you were kind enough to include me." Then end with 'I'd love to go/I'm sorry, there's a tight deadline I can't miss' etc., depending on if you want to attend or not. The language conveys i) appreciation, which is important when somebody extends free anything to you, and ii) subtly hints that you are not employed in an administrative position, WITHOUT outrightly saying it.

Free lunch! Yay!
