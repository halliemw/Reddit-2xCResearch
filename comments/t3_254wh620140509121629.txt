We are weighing all the feedback, both in posts like this, the posts from ladies that like the change and the varied feedback we're getting via modmail and PM's. And you're also right that we're trying a bit of a wait and see right now. We're into day 3 and the initial brouhaha is starting to settle (TMI Friday notwithstanding!), but it's still here and we also want to make sure everyone is heard.   

We talked to dreaming for quite awhile yesterday and she isn't happy with our responses, which is fine and fair, but I do want to say we are responding as much and the best we can to everyone we can.
