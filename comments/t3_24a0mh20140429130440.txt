You can't consent if you're incapacitated. Opiates don't incapacitate you unless you're on very high doses. Without any information about dosages, you can't make the assumption that she was incapacitated. For all we know, it was consensual sex.

(Edit: Just to clarify, for all we know, it was consensual sex that was technically non-consensual because his girlfriend was below the age of consent.)
