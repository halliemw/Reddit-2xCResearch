That's exactly why I started on birth control at 16. I started on the oral combination pill and was on that for over 10 years. I just recently switched to a progesterine-only pill. 

Pros: Generally speaking, lighter periods, fewer symptoms of period, pregnancy protection, regular periods, clearer skin

Cons: Increased heart rate, stroke and heart attack risk, can increase weight gain, can cause headaches/migraines

Those are particularly true for the oral pill. Other forms of birth control have other effects. You really just need to thoroughly research it and talk about all your options with your doctor.
