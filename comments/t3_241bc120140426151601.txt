Where I worked this summer, the department had three married couples. It got difficult to indicate which one of them you meant, because prefixes weren't any help (both members of each pair had their doctorates and went by "Doctor Lastname") and all three wives had taken their husbands' name. Out of respect, we didn't want to use first names. That's was certainly a confusing time.
