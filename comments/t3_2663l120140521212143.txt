I'm a sass so I might be inclined to dish him, during a meeting, some words.  It sounds to me like he has a fetish and he's expressing that fetish in his art.  There may also be a level of exhibition and humiliation (for the viewer, after all he seems to really be into the rape thing) and he is using the club as his public sexual outlet.  Maybe because he can't get laid and this gets his rocks off.

This is a harsh way to view it, perhaps, but it may have some truth to it.  Thankfully my geeky guy friends would have backed me up if I was uncomfortable with someone in our group, and have before.  

Call him out, don't back down, and make sure people are there to see it.
