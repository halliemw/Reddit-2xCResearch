I do this a lot some months, this month included. I hate when I cry so much, it makes me feel like a big baby!   
  
I was literally about to cry yesterday because I dropped my Sonic cup and some of it fell onto the ground. My day was absolutely ruined and my eyes stung from tears for like 15 minutes. I felt like a dope because my boyfriend was trying to make me feel better and tell me it wasn't that bad, but it only made me feel worse because I knew I was overreacting.   
  
Periods suck :( now I miss my Sonic drink...
