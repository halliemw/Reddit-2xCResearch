We had a wonderful ceremony for about $300. My dress was cute, we used his grandmas antique engagement set for me and a $25 ring for him. We got married at a little wedding chapel a fee hours away. We had 5 guests and then went out to dinner just the two of us. It was great! It can be done, just do what is important to you.
