Thanks for your reply. Its a good point. I asked a little bit about it last time. But my therapist didn't seem to intent to really 'prepare for it' she said I could just bring him along whenever it was convenient. He said he'd come to my next one, it sort of seemed he wanted to get it over and done with.
