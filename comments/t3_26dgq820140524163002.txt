Same. I got induced for high blood pressure at 39 weeks. Got swelling on my cervix plus a dropping heart rate for my son, and I agreed to a C-section.  
  
Up to then, the staff at the hospital were great.  
  
After his birth, I could not, for love nor money, get him to feed. Stating that I was having issues resulted in "just keep trying". With the exception of a night nurse who was simply wonderful.  
  
Asking for formula at the hospital, though... well, you'd think I was trying to feed him poison. I was told that whatever I could express would be enough (yep... 0.1ml is *totally* enough!), and then had to sign a form to state that I knew it increased the chances of obesity, diabetes etc etc etc. I felt like shit.  
  
It was only my last night there that the night nurse I mentioned suggested he could have a tongue tie (he did. A severe one). She also asked if I'd like a breast pump. Suddenly I could get a whole lot more milk for my boy that just didn't happen when expressing by hand.  
  
We bought a pump on the way home from the hospital. For 3 or 4 weeks (which includes about a week after his tongue tie was cut), I would try to feed him on the breast, fail (usually in tears and with increasing frequency, screaming on my part), feed him a bottle, then sit attached to the pump for half an hour.  
   
I stopped to save my sanity. I wasn't getting a break, it was just a constant cycle that revolved around feeding. Once I stopped both trying to breastfeed and pump, I started to get back to being myself and actually enjoying spending time with my son.
