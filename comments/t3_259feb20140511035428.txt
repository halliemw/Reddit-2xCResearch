I hear so often, like especially in /r/xxfitness, about how people still think that way! People react so badly when women lift, and stuff! And that's just, luckily, totally alien to me. My mother has had many failings when it comes to instilling in me healthy thoughts about my body (like, *many* failings), but we just had an hour long conversation over text about my gym progress, and whether I prefer high weight/low reps or low weight/high reps, and how dumb it is that women think they'll hulk out magically somehow without the use of massive steroids. In that regard, she performed admirably.
