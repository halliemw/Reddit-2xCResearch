Oh no, you're not coming off as condescending at all!  In fact, it's really helpful and I appreciate it! I honestly don't have much (any) practice with alternate firing positions. In fact, that Mauser is the first rifle I've ever shot AND that photo is from the first time we shot it. The stand in the photo is there because we weren't sure what exactly it would do when we pulled the trigger because it looked like it was in good shape... but you know, you can never be sure with a new old gun, so our first few shots were from about 15 feet away when we pulled a string lol.

I just looked at the marksmanship principles. Lots to remember, but thanks for bringing them up. Makes a lot more sense than someone going "hold it farther back... butt out a little more, don't hold your arms down as much."

And it is beautiful! Planning on finding some more war-era rifles and displaying them in our new house. :)
