Oh my gosh, thank you so much. You have no idea how much your comment meant to me &lt;3


Edit: update for anyone interested:

I did write a little bit last night but got too upset so I stopped. My therapist was happy with what I did, but we expanded on what I wrote today during our session. It was really tough, but I got through it with her help. She's amazing. I've been seeing since 2011 and she's gotten me through so much. She always knows exactly what to say. I'm so lucky to have found the perfect match in a therapist.

Thank you to everyone who read my comment and even just thought about me for a split second. It really means a lot to have a community that I can share something like this with. (My friends IRL kinda suck with these sorta things - I should probably try to find new ones.)
