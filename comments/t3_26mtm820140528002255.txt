Yeah when I first got birth control they didn't even do an exam. Granted I went to get birth control BEFORE becoming sexually active. But then the next year they didn't need one...or the next one. I think it was after I was 21 that they did it and the last 2 years didn't require one to get the rx. I have an appointment this Saturday but they didn't mention anything about an exam even after looking at my chart...so I'm hoping it won't be a wasted trip. I'd get my pap during this appointment, but I'm currently on my period so it's just not going to work out, but I am out of refills so I NEED to go in ASAP, because I was dumb and waited until the last minute. I think maybe doctors won't write an rx with out a pap/exam but Planned Parenthood always seems to go by slightly different guidelines. Hopefully they'll still give it to me as long as I schedule an exam/pap soon.
