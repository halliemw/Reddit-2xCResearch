It doesn't matter that he had no chance and many agree they too would not reciprocate.   The question is if it's overreacting to feel "violated" and make comparisons to rape for an "undesirable person" expressing (in a polite and complimentary, non derogatory, non sexualized way) romantic feelings.

If the same story had a handsome 23 year old man who she found interesting and charming did the EXACT SAME THINGS nobody would suggest it was inappropriate.

It doesn't become "rape like" because you find him gross.  I know many people who have had rewarding relationships in their 20s with people 30-40 years older than them.  This interest may have been unwanted and indeed gross....but there is nothing terrible in the asking.  There was no longer a power dynamic in my view because the employment had already reached its conclusion.

So if the post was. - gross an older guy had a crush on me and it's yucky thinking about romance with him.  - I would agree.

When it's "I'm violated" , "implied Harassment" and being compared to having someone grope your breasts or crotch.... That's over reacting dear.

This situation reminds me of the SNL sexual harassment corporate video.

The reason it bugs me.... Actual people really are harassed in powerless situations that are terrible....it belittles those to use language like that on situations like this imo
