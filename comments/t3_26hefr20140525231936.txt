It sounds very similar to me, I consider myself on the asexual spectrum because I'm not sexual in the normal way, But I'm not totally asexual because I do find people sexually attractive. I just I have zero desire to have sex with them.

I have a libido, and like to masturbate for the physical sensations, and sometimes I picture people I like. But if those people were to ask if I wanted to have sex, the answer is "no". Even if I love them, am in a committed relationship to them, etc, I just don't want sex.

It takes months before someone goes from being emotionally attractive to sexually attractive, I think that's sort of reminiscent of demi-sexuality. But my understanding is that demisexuals will enjoy sex once that attraction is formed.

It doesn't matter anyway, You don't need a label. As long as you are happy to just go with the flow and feel the way you feel, it doesn't matter what you are or aren't. If you have a partner who respects your boundaries and your limits, then who cares *why* you have those boundaries.
