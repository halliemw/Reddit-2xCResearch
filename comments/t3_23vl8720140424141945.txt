Firstly make a big distinction. Bank of America bought Countrywide who was a huge cause of the financial crisis (They invented liar loans). BofA was a major player in the crisis and their purchase of Merril Lynch was full of lies. J.P. Morgan for the most part was not involved and stayed away from the toxic assets and as a result did not take much of a hit. Jamie Dimon (JP CEO) supports the Volker rule and declined TARP funds until the government insisted. All bankers are not created equal.
