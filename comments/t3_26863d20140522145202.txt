I wouldn't say I hate my husband's family, but we've had some disagreements and rough spots over the past few years. His parents are wealthy, so they tend to think that throwing money at things will automatically get them what they want. My husband's younger brother also sounds similar to your fianc√©'s sister - he's 22, making attempt #7 I think at college right now (mental health issues and lying/not going to class issues), and has never had to work for anything in his life. When it was decided that he would come back to school near us (his parents live in FL), the inlaws just called my husband and announced that the brother would be living with us for the summer and we would be responsible for making sure he was successful in his summer classes.  

Husband and I ended up in counseling over that, because husband couldn't understand why that was such a huge and egregious boundary violation.  

So that's my advice to you - before you take that final step and get married, make sure you and your husband are in agreement on boundaries. Getting married means you're starting your own new nuclear family, and that should come with some distance from each of your families of origin. You just need to be on the same page about how much and what kind of distance.
