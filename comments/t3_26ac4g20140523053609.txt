The context I've heard this is usually where you have a woman and man working a certain job (usually one which involves manual labor, at least in part), and the woman refuses to do a certain task because "it's for men". Or alternately, the woman might not even be assigned the task in the first place, because her boss assumes it's too tough for women.
