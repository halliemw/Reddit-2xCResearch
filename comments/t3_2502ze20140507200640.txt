I think they are women with another unique and valuable perspective.

I recall a thread or two where a few transwomen and transmen discussed how differently they were treated based on their perceived gender. It was extremely illuminating, particularly because there are parts of my experience as a woman I have either ignored or never noticed, because I have always lived them.

I hope that the influx of new folks doesn't cause more trouble for the transwomen who frequent this sub.
