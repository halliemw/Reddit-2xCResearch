My mom and I are similarly not close. I can clearly remember 2 times in my childhood when she paid specific attention to me and they're still some of my favorite memories, but mostly our time was spent on the couch watching tv. I live 2500 miles away now and when we're together it's just awkward because we don't have anything in common and she just wants to watch tv.

My sister lives near here and still relies on her pretty heavily. My mom acts exasperated but I know she loves being needed. They're best friends and they constantly post pictures of each other and the gifts they give each other. It's just weird, and it's distant, but we love each other a lot. I just don't know how to make it better.
