It's not just about the two sisters, their similarities are just what led me to find this blog. It's more of a general trend and the pattern of Disney creating princesses that were critiqued to a certain point until they hardly changed the design, such as the difference between Elsa/Anna and Repunzel. Not to mention the mom of Elsa and Anna has the same exact face as well. Which, biologically could only happen if she used mitosis. 

Although, these are whimsical cartoons and aren't restrained by the laws of biology. It's not that it's offensive that two sisters look alike, it's the inference Disney is making that although in animation it is better to have one character with many faces Frozen has many characters with one face.
