It sounds like you really know what you want, so I'd suggest accepting it and immediately planning for the future with that in mind.  For instance, since it sounds like you know you want to keep it, there's no reason to worry about what it'll do to your body - what's going to happen will happen and the sooner you can update your ideas of what your life will look like, the sooner you can outline a path for what you need to do to support yourself (and the baby, if adoption isn't an option).

Acceptance of decisions has helped get me through some really tough times.  It clears your mind to think of the more important things, without getting distracted by regrets or what-ifs.  There's time for that later - right now you need to focus on taking action to get things in order before the baby is born.

You should tell the father.  Knowing what you want should make telling him easier - it doesn't matter if he wants you to have an abortion if that's not what you want.  Keep in mind that the baby is entitled to the resources/support of both of you (this shouldn't be something you decide on its behalf), meaning that you should definitely pursue child support, and give the father the opportunity to be in his child's life.

On the other hand, if you're more ambivalent about keeping it than your post implies, I'd suggest giving yourself a day or two to focus solely on this.  Meditate, mourn the fact that you have to either give up the baby or the image of the life you thought you'd be having.  Ask yourself what you want from life in a week, a month, a year, 5 years, 10 years.  Make a budget, calculate the amount of money you'll need for a baby and apartment.  Ask yourself if you really want a baby - if abortion is still out of the question, is adoption on the table?  But once you've made a decision, own it, be proud of it, and be confident that you're making the choice that's right for you right now.

Good luck!
