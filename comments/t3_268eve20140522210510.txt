I will give you my perspective here.  Ambien definitely makes people behave strangely.  Hallucinations and sleepwalking and so much more.  Sleep-driving even.  The guy had no reason to think that you were not consenting to sex.  It's okay that you were freaked out about it and I'm so sorry to hear that you developed vaginismus that kept you from enjoying sex with your partner.  Losing control of your body to people or medication can make anyone lose their center.   
You want to come to "terms" with that sex act.  It was a drug side effect like a rash or nausea.  Your history made that loss of control more traumatic than it might some other people.  I had a similar event occur after I started a medication.  I woke up in the morning all, "Hey babe, did we have sex last night?"  My husband smiled and said "yes, you seemed to enjoy it".  I'm sure I did because I trust him and I trust him to take care of my body.  
Did he hurt you physically?  Did you wake up and feel like he took advantage of your altered state to push some boundaries?  If this sort of thing happened I say feed him to the dogs.  That's shitty behavior.
But if he thought that his partner was playful and wanting him even when she was a little hazy I feel that it's a different story.  If you want to explain why things fell apart that's great.  I don't think it's appropriate to bring it up to punish him a year and a half later (I think that's the timeline).  I'm so sorry that this has been on your mind so long and has upset you so.  I'm big on keeping the things/thoughts that are useful and getting rid of as much unhelpful stuff as possible.  
My two cents is that while you may have not consented to sex, he did not consent to rape either.  If it was me, I would chalk it up to drug side effect and never speak of it unless expressly asked.
