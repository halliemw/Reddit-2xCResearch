This.  You should lay out your expectations for her behavior clearly, and tell her if she can't avoid drama, she should back out now.  Same with the ex, if he's the dramatic type.  

My SIL had a bridesmaid and a groomsman who were getting divorced from each other.  They still managed to not bring their drama into the wedding.  I was very impressed.
