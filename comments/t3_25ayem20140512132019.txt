I was the secretary for a professor studying delayed childbearing for a year. To summarize the takeaways I got from it: 

1. Women become less fertile over time, and assisted reproduction is very common for those who are 35 or older. These ARTs are often expensive, time consuming, uncertain, and can have unexpected outcomes like multiple births. 

2. There are increased risk of birth defects, especially if mothers are 40 or older. The most common birth defect is downs syndrome. I apologize for using the term "birth defect", I feel it's insensitive/disrespectful but this is the language used in an academic setting.

3. There are more frequent pregnancy and birth complications in older mothers. Premature births are more common (and those have a HOST of issues that last well through childhood). 

4. On the positive side, there is a definite social benefit to balance out the physical disadvantage. Older women are more patient, compassionate, and have more life experience to draw on. They also have more financial resources on average. The kids benefit from all of these factors.
