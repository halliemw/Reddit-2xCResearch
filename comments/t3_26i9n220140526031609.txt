This is where you take care of yourself and figure it out in the morning. Make yourself comfortable and go to sleep. How old are the kids? Is there anyone you can contact for where they can go by the time you get to work? After nine hours it's acceptable for you to go through stuff to find grandparents phone numbers, anything. If they have to go to school in the morning, take them half an hour early and let the principal know what happened. Your job is to keep the kids safe. So it's okay for you to do that. It's also okay for you to take the kids to your house where you might be better able to take care of them and leave the mom a note.

Edit: Also, if you question the whereabouts of the mother you can call local jails and hospitals to see if she's there. Anything might have happened. She could have had an accident, she could have been roofied, anything. But mostly know that unless this is some horrible mistake on her part, she is going to try to get a hold of you as fast as she can, and she'll want to know her kids are okay. So keep them okay.
