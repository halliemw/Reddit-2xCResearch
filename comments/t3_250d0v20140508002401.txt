This is anxiety, but it is specific to relationships. You are what we call an "Anxious Attacher". One of the primary characteristics is always worrying that your partner does not love you as much as you love them. There are other characteristics, such as looking for patterns in your partners behaviour which may give insight to how much or how little they care for you. Losing interest in hobbies and friendships, and making your relationship your main priority and in fact making *it* your hobby. Feeling euphorically happy when your partner had behaved in a way that makes you feel loved, and feeling incredibly low when he has behaved in a way that concerns you. A tendency to sulk and withhold affection when he has done this, in an attempt to punish them.

Here are a couple of articles that explain it better.
