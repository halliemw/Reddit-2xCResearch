It is disheartening. 

My brothers are both great with kids. When one of my brothers was senior in high school, he noticed the neighbor kid (who was around 6) was really scared about going to school. He had the bus driver stop in front of the kid's house (which was more inconvenient for my brother) and then walked the kid to his class every day for at least a month, until the kid got over his fears. He didn't do it to look good (I only know the story because my parents only found out from the kid's parents), he just did it because it was the right thing to do. While I think it's pretty aww-worthy, it's not because it's a dude being nice to kids, but because it's very considerate and sweet. I'm amazed how many people just notice the former. 

My best friend, on the other hand, has never voluntarily held a child and is not fond of kids in general. People will still just expect her to look after their kids "for a few minutes" or entertain them when she's sitting next to them on a plane because she's a girl. It's strange all around, and no one wins.
