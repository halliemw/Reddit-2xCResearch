I also love cooking/baking (for my bf), I have long hair and will never get a short haircut, I love traditional men: those who work hard and earn the money while the woman is taking care of the kids at home. I would never ask my bf to marry me, no matter how much I would like to get married, because its his job to ask me! When I get married, I like to have a big traditional party and hope my husband will carry me over the threshold. 
I never leave the house without make up and I would love to have a garden in which I can grown my own vegetables!

So, I think I can consider myself pretty traditional, but I also have a lot of non-traditional characteristics and I don't really live the tradtional life atm, haha (sure would love too though!).

EDIT: Oh, I forgot the most important one; I like to care so much.. I have way too many motherly feelings and I always want to help everyone out!
