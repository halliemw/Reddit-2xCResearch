I understand the upkeep worries and the cost but I believe they last for a while, long enough for you to get insurance on your own. Most people have been able to save their nipples or you can get them tattooed on after or get something else in place of them. I have a smaller chest than you I can fit into a B but I don't fill it out. I'm also anti bras so I don't mind losing my nipples so I can always be bra free and not have hard nipples! 

I had positives from birth control, knowing when I get my period a little less acne. For some reason it didn't give me the positives like no acne and a lighter period but I just changed it so fingers crossed! I think it only increases your risk if it's hormonal breast cancer I'm pretty sure it says that right on the packet. There are also non hormonal types so I think you should start talking to a specialist on this subject. 

Have any of your other siblings gone and got tested? I have a sister who is a year younger than me and hasn't gotten tested yet. I feel like she hasn't because she'll finally have to face what caused my mothers death and that was hard on her since my mom was her rock.
