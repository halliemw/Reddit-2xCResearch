While you're right, diminishing real problems is dangerous, it's very different from an outside point of view. I teach high schoolers, and I can see the difference between someone who needs professional help and someone who is having a rough time right now. I was one of those kids once, too, so maybe that helps. 

Adolescence is a very turbulent time: you are discovering who you are as a person and what the "real" world is like. It can be very scary and threatening and teens have normal, expected reactions (if sometimes unhealthy). 

Part of the problem here is that mental illness very clearly garners more attention for a person. If a person feels they lack the attention they need, subconsciously they may start thinking there's something wrong with them (mental illness). If we start fawning over kids, making a big deal over their struggles, they will perceive these struggles as a bigger deal than they might actually be. It goes both ways.
