sorry mom, I"m not a prize for someone to win.  I am much more than my virginity.  I am a good person who is making a positive difference in the world.

If your religion can't accept that even women who have children (like you) have value, then I can't associate with that religion any longer.  I believe that you have value beyond just who and when you fuck.  I hope you learn that someday.
