Actually, that's something he's already offered. But I'd feel weird about him doing it because I'd feel like he was doing it for me. Neither one of us wants kids, but I'm the one who's more against it. Also, we have a close friend whose wife made him get a vasectomy. They got divorced a couple of years later and now he's getting married to a woman who wants children. Our friend is going to try to get the vasectomy reversed, but it's pretty intrusive and isn't always successful. So I guess I'm just worried that if something should happen (I die in a car crash or get squished by a falling piano), my fianc√© might end up in a similar situation. I know it's more emotional than rational to think that way, but I would feel guilty if he got snipped.
