Hello ladies, XY here, and I gotta ask something. I know men are often the worst about judging women by their appearance, but this just...mean, bashing that takes place withing your gender is disheartening, and I don't know how to say anything. Case in point, I work with a lot of women, and they were bashing on some poor girl's eyebrows. Not something obvious like a unibrow or anything, but because she either did, or did not have an "hombre" eyebrow? I tried to ease the bashing by stating I, as a man, had never noticed a woman's eyebrows unless it was something extreme, like shaved off. "Oh, but we notice!", and on it went. 

My question is, how do I discourage this type of hate mongering as it's supposedly a girls only sport sometimes? Being an ass is never ok, regardless of gender.
