I was with you until you pulled the "white guilt" card. This particular issue has nothing to do with race, and attributing ones (misguided) actions of support of a family member who is presumably of the same race, to some kind of ploy to make themselves feel better about being born of a privileged colour, is in of itself a racist statement. 

Why would you throw that into the mix? What does it bring to your arguement that wasn't already there?
