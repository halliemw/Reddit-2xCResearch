You don't have to write it out if you don't want to. She'll understand. Especially now, when this story has hit you so hard. And it's really not ridiculous of you to feel triggered by this. It's understandable, and regardless, it's not something you can control. When it gets really bad, try distractions. Do some relaxing and fun things for yourself.
