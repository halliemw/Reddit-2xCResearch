...it's not just in the workplace but in all facets of life. 

This hits hard as my public school best friend was murdered by her jealous psycho restraining ordered X-husband. He entered her house one night while she was in the bath with a gun and he shot and killed her as she ran naked in the street begging for help ... leaving 3 children one with special needs without their mother or their father. 

Love yah and miss yah still ...Jill x0x0x0
