Not me, but my mom and it's sort of relevant to your situation.  He pressured her into one she didn't want and while she's forgiven him now, she still regrets it.  But it was something she reluctantly agreed to because they "talked" about it.  Or he threatened to leave, whatever.  

Now turn that around and think how your husband will feel when he finds out (and he most likely will at some point), and he doesn't even get to talk to you about this beforehand.  He's going to feel betrayed and angry and rightfully so.  I'm all for a woman's right to bodily autonomy, but at the same time you two are a legal partnership.  He at least deserves the respect of telling him what you're doing with your body.

Also and kind of on a personal level, when I found out everything about my mom's abortion, it really made me wonder what was so bad about me that they didn't want another kid.  If you do go through with this, talk to your kids as soon and as openly as possible.  Which is obviously problematic since you can't trust kids to keep their mouths shut.  But when they find out, (and they probably will), they will almost undoubtedly have questions and a bit of doubt about their place in your lives.
