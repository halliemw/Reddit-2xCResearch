Yes, but not the way Whedon does. It worked for Avengers because it already had a campy feel to it. The same wouldn't work with Wonder Woman unless it was done with lots of love towards the original TV series but then it wouldn't be a massive production like WB/DC wants them to.

If WW was remade into a tv-series, then I'd agree with you.
