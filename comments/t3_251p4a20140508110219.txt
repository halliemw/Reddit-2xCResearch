For reddit as a whole to be more inclusive, it has to come from the admins. This is not PUBLIC site, and as such can be run as any other private company. 

Ban openly toxic subreddits (As they did with creepshots) - start with /r/CandidFashionPolice, /r/beatingwomen, /r/NiggerStories, and anything else that falls in that category. They're not hard to find, and the fact that they exist isn't some monument to free speech, it's a testament that reddit doesn't mind paying for hosting space for this shit. Free speech is adequately served when these people aren't reported to the legal authorities for their words - we owe them nothing more, certainly not a platform and a space to meet. 

Dumping the work of making reddit inclusive on volunteer moderators and their unwilling, already targeted, and marginalized communities is not only lazy, it is cowardly, and it tacitly supports the abuse.

As a small example of what *could be*: Take a look at subreddits like /r/Fitness - they realized they had a problem with being an unwelcoming space, and took specific steps to address it - they added text in their submission box, rules about hate speech, and took a hard-line moderation stance *from a position as the dominant, respected authority*.  (Of course, they got made a default, as well, so we'll see how that goes.)

 That needs to happen, site-wide, for this to stick. Not in one subreddit that has zero chance to change anything outside itself, and barely a hope to prevent itself from changing. 

Edit: Oh, did I touch a nerve among people who frequent those subreddits that don't belong anywhere that can be accessed without TOR? Cockroaches.
