Honestly, I think this story should have some perspective shined on it. I sincerely doubt a cop would *intentionally* make someone feel "like a slut", however I *can* see how someone, after witnessing and being part of an interrogation, would be emotionally heated. 

Offense intended and offense taken are entirely different things. You can choose to take offense at things, or you can choose not to. It seems that OP is choosing to take offense to questions that are not only standard. But are valid and *required* by the officer in order to do their job correctly. 

Edit- I absolutely think sensitivity training is important. But I don't think those questions are inherently insensitive. They're valid questions that need a valid answer. Her sobriety affects the charge of the crime. Her awareness does as well. If she fought or screamed, that's another way they can validate an aggravated rape vs rape charge. 

People are getting really upset over questions cop use to make charges stuck longer to the pieces of filth who rape. I think it's important to learn about WHY the cops are asking what they're asking when they ask. *Every single question* cops ask are asked to form a greater picture and understanding of the crime. 

There were photographs of my rape, and a video. The cops had the video, saw me fighting back, and STILL had to ask those questions. It's all a matter of protocol and gaining information. I didn't report my rape initially. Someone else reported theirs which led to the discovery of video tapes, mine being one of them. Every single one of us had to answer why we did or didn't fight, why we didn't report things immediately, if we were sober, etc. It's all completely standard.
