I can't think of any negative side effects I've had on my current pill, which I've been on for years. I love being able to control my periods, and they're also lighter and shorter than they used to be. I've taken 2 other brands previously and had one bad side effect on each (loss of libido on the first, constant spotting on the second) but neither were a huge deal and it's very easy to change to a different pill. 

Personally I would not want to go on a triphasic pill (triphasic have different hormone levels each week, monophasic have the same) because it's much harder to skip periods on triphasic pills.
