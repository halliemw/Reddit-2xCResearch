i believe that honest, comprehensive, factual sex education is crucial to healthy development. however, i think certain topics should be reserved for certain stages of development. it's hard for young children to grasp the general idea that not every behaviour is age-appropriate for them. going on adult rides or watching r-rated movies, for example. they want instant gratification, which is why i'd worry about exposing them to the idea of recreational sex and orgasms and how pleasurable it all is. i wonder if it would encourage them to engage in sexual behaviours with each other. but hey, maybe i'm wrong. it's an interesting discussion though!
