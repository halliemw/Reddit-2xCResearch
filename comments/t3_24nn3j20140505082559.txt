Like I said above, title is misleading, this isn't about emailing your profs, it's about sending email to a stranger inquiring about doing grad research with the prof.  

Also the whole point is implicit bias, most people don't know they do it and even a lot of people don't notice it happens to them (you can easily rationalize a non response as they are busy, or they don't have any positions open, etc).
