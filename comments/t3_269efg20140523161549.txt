Yeah, it's really not the same system as the United States. 
Double Dissolution will put everyone's seats up for election, and one of the main criticisms of the current Abbott government is that when he was elected, his campaign promises included no change to pension, taxes, Medicare and a whole bunch of other stuff. People voted for him thinking he would uphold (at least some of) his campaign promises. This guy now has an approval rating of 30. He will get voted out. But supply needs to be blocked in the senate first. 

I don't remember there being any case of missing votes last election, in any case the libs won fair and square - to no ones surprise since labor let down a bunch of people with infighting. But it's one of those cases when you thought you were voting for the lesser evil when suddenly that guy turns out to be the biggest prick in the country. I voted Greens.
