HOLY FUCK U USE THE CARDBOARD. No wonder it hurts. Yeah its cool just try to use the plastic ones. Always company tampons are the best. Never leak! Get the box mixed with super and regulars. It should feel fine. The plastic applicator is the best. But basically, just shove it in to almost the part where it has that little grabber between the stem n the applicator. And then when u almost are done pushing up the stem, pull out th applicator part. And make sure the only thing inside you is the tampon itself. You should be fine.
