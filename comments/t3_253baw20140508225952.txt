I would tell them what you have told us here about the pain, where it hurts, when it hurts and in what ways. Don't minimize your discomfort, if you can't deal-say so. I would look for a doctor who deals with endometriosis on a regular basis, some gynecologists are woefully uninformed. 
I have had endometriosis for 30 years as has my best friend so if you have any questions don't hesitate to shoot me a message. Good luck!
