We don't really talk about it. He only brings it up if we're fighting or something. I know our communication SUCKS, and we've both admitted to it. We've talked about couples counseling for those reasons. But... even if he doesn't bring it up I know how he feels about it. 

The truth is I am depressed, but he doesn't understand it or how to deal with it. He seems to think that effort fixes everything, and it doesn't. For him it's like "if you just do this and this and this... you should be fine, right?" and no, I wish it was that easy. I want to make friends, despite being depressed and I am not a downer around other people, I just wish he understood it a bit better.

Yeah, I understand about making a bunch at first and kind of weeding them out. It sounds like a lot of effort to get hurt over, but maybe something good would come of it!
