Very funny/frustrating example of this today: http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2014/05/14/twitter-splained/ Some guy(?) on on twitter trying to mansplain to Tara Smith about farms and antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Smith is scientist studying transmission dynamics of antibiotic resistance who happened to be presenting at a conference that day. He didn't STFU until another (white, male) scientist told him she was right.
