I also felt stuck with my writing as well, since the whole business of translating your passion and experiences into a succinct essay seems like a hugely daunting task. When in doubt, I was just very straightforward about my answers (and I think people appreciate that). Pretend that you are having a conversation with someone who is asking your these questions, then just write down exactly what you would vocally say out loud. Also, keep it career goal oriented unless otherwise specified (as another user said).
