Look. Society shames women no matter what - your weight, height, your looks will always be flawed in the eyes of loud-mouthed morons. But you're a real person, you're not a photoshopped picture for them to jerk off to. Your face, your hair, your body belongs to you and only you. Do you like yourself as you are? If you personally feel uncomfortable about something, change it. Start dieting (here is the [one diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukan_Diet) I can vouch for), start exercising. Your doc thinks you're healthy, and this is the only opinion outside of your head that matters when we're talking about your body. Everybody else, who fail to qualify as medical specialists, are free to fuck off.
