I have to ask, do you ever purposefully *not* state that you're a man because you're **afraid** of the negative reaction? Have you even chosen a screenname or a gamertag that was gender neutral because you were **worried** about the harassment you'd receive if people thought you were a man? Because that is something that I'm pretty sure almost every single woman on reddit has encountered at one point. That is not something that most men encounter. You are not harassed for being a man. Nobody will post [this](http://asset-0.soup.io/asset/2462/8448_0d5a.jpeg) stupid picture if you happen to be in a picture that you post. If you mention your sex life at all, nobody will say "RIP your inbox." Nobody will comment on your body, saying you have a nice ass, or pointing out your nipples or breasts. 

The reason why it's so disheartening to be defaulted as a man is because it's saying that women are weird, they are the "other." And when women are suddenly called out as women, they get harassed. We're not saying that you should start using she/he, but maybe stick to gender neutral terms like "they" or "OP." We don't want to just assume every poster is a man, because in doing that you are assuming that women are the other and not the norm. There are a lot of women on this site, don't assume something about a poster before they confirm it.

edit: Vik1ng's response was generally along the lines of "so, should I start saying he/she? I have to use some gender pronoun, etc" and then basically saying that he doesn't mention that he's a male all that frequently either, so a lot of reddit is then gender neutral. I was answering to that trying to say that it's not really general neutral if you are assuming everyone is male, and that defaulting to male rather than neutral is actually quite harmful. etc.
