haa, no. I still don't know what I want to do when I grow up, so I'm waiting on applying to grad school. However, when I do go, I'll need as many scholarships I can get, so I've worked hard to keep a high GPA. Now I'm just wondering how far I can let myself go in this last semester ;) I'll probably still be a perfectionist in the last minute and turn in quality work.
