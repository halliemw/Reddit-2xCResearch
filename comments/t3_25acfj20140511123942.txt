Thanks for this. My mother was an alcoholic drug addict who put various men before her children. I attempted to reconcile with her and form a relationship a few years ago but it didn't work out. Shit happens. Last time I heard from her she called me a cunt and told me to "go back to your father." I'm 25 now, and this day doesn't hurt as much as it used to anymore. I take comfort in knowing that I became strong and independent and funny and kind anyway... and it's her loss because she doesn't get to know me.
