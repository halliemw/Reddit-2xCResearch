The problem is, there's not really any good name for a women oriented sub that isn't exclusionary. 2x is trans-exclusionary. Lady has various class and behaviour implications. Girl is insulting and diminutive. Female is objectifying. Women is the closest, but it can also be trans exclusionary, plus there are the people who spell it womyn. Femme is feminine, which isn't just a lesbian identity but yes, that's the most common usage. 

The community is woman oriented. Everyone is allowed, but it's for anyone who identifies as female. If you have a better suggestion for a name, I'd love to hear it but this is a discussion that's been had over and over and no one's really come up with a great solution.
