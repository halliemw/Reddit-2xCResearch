Both started from places of uncertainty, awkwardness and fear, and grew into amazing, resourceful women who were independent, fierce, curious, and loved learning. Plus, I especially loved Aerin as I was horse crazy as a girl :)

This reminds me of another inspiring character "Maggie" from Behind the Attic Wall. Also a story of a girl finding her strength and place in the world.
