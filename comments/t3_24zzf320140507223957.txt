I have made an effort to stop making myself the butt of my own jokes just to get people to like me/laugh with me. (for example, making fun of myself for making a mistake and calling myself an idiot)

It turns out people are really turned off (in a platonic way) by hearing other people put themselves down.

It has helped my self-confidence a lot, which in turn has helped me to be more more secure with how good I am at my job.
