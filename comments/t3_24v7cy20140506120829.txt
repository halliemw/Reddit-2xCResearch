Sometimes mine does this when I'm getting closer to shark week (since your vaginal canal shrinks or your uterus drops lower or something during that time - not sure of specifics all I know is that there is less room at that time), or right before a bowel movement. I find that when putting it back in, I have to make sure it's tucked either under or over top of the opening of the uterus - if it's pushing against it, it won't be able to be completely inside of me.
