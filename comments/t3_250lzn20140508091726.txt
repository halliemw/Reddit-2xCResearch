I'm not saying that everything that this man said is  correct, or even that I agree with it. He does however make one specific valid point. Some rape is easily preventable if the steps are taken to reduce risk in certain situations.

He mentions women getting black out drunk at parties resulting in rape. Again, I am not saying that these women deserve to be raped. In that sense he's not wrong. Going to a party and getting black out drunk is a sure fire way to greatly increase your odds of getting sexually assaulted. Is it right? No, of course it's not right, no one would ever argue that it's right to get raped just because you had too much to drink. But it is easily preventable if the proper measures are taken, such as not drinking as much, enacting a buddy system, leaving if you begin to feel unsafe/uncomfortable etc... Once again, I am in no way condoning rape.

It's kind of like this. If I go to an ATM in a bad part of the city at 3AM, take out $2000 in cash, and begin to loudly count my money I'm probably going to get mugged. No one has the right to mug me, and I have every right in the world to take money out of an ATM and count it whenever I please. But realistically, there were other options I had that could have easily reduced my chances  of getting mugged.

The way this man goes about making his point is obviously not the right way, and the majority of what he says is absolute garbage. But somewhere deep down he did make one good point albeit one surrounded by bigotry.
