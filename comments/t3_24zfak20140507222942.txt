Like I said, after over 15 years of witnessing the same phenomenon happen over and over again, on many different types of forums with very different moderation styles, I'm not sure there *is* a fix.

I see a comparison in live performance, particularly sketch comedy or stand-up. If you've ever done live comedy, something that you notice is that audiences tend to get dumber if they are over a certain size. A small live audience will laugh at your smart jokes, not so much the stupid ones. A massive audience will turn the most bottom-of-the-barrel, lowest-common-denominator gags into minutes of screaming laughter, while the best, smartest jokes in your show whiz by without so much as a chuckle. It's like the mass mentality makes even the smart people in the audience dumber or less responsive.
