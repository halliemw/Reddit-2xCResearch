Before I went off the pill to get pregnant I would regularly go 3-4 months continuous. I liked to let my period happen 4-5 times a year just to make sure everything was working down there.

I did that for years and got pregnant a couple months after going off the pill without trying too hard. So it doesn't seem to have affected anything in that regard.
