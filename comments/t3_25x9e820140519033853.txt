To be honest, I'm not defending the workshops themselves. I don't know enough about what they say in them to be able to tell whether they'd be effective. 

But I'm not talking about calling out strangers by getting into fights, no, and I am talking about calling out harassment and discriminatory language, not rape. And I am indeed talking about friends. I don't agree that friends won't call each other out. Plenty of people are friends with others who don't share all of their views. People are generally uncomfortable with disagreeing with their mates, even if their mates have completely unacceptable views. So if we can encourage people to call out their friends then yes, I do think that will make a difference. Especially with guys who don't respect women, and won't ever listen to a woman telling them about what behaviour is OK and what isn't. I'm not sure where you're getting blaming from though, apart from the sense that we as a society are to blame for not having tackled this whole problem more effectively. 

This is a big problem. Really big. Incidents like Steubenville demonstrate that the guys who actually rape probably aren't likely to "benefit" from a workshop like this in the sense you're thinking. But those guys only did that because they lived in a place where they knew virtually everyone would be on their side. If we can make it socially unacceptable by ensuring that everyone else around them understands that what they did was wrong, I think that's worth doing.
