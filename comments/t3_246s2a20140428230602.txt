I disagree, both yes and no can change.

Someone can say yes and then change their mind, and vice versa.  What matters is the last word that was spoken.  If someone says yes and then says no in the middle of the act, that's rape if you don't stop.  If someone says no and then later decides to say yes, that's not rape at all.
