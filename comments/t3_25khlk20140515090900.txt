Yep. The thing is, you will only notice one side of it, if you even notice, if you hang out with mostly one gender. For instance, most guys I know *rarely* hang out with groups of women on their own. And if there's more than one guy but still a majority of women, they'll tend to have their own conversations. 

I don't think, as the OP seems to be implying somewhat, that it's a guy thing to do. I'm not actually sure *why* people do it, but it's not just a guy thing.
