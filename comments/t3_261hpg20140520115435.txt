I would vote for 18,  really, for everything.  Driving, drinking, sex and voting.  I can only base this on my own experience but looking back, I have always acted like a grown up, but I knew nothing about life at 16, that's just too, too young.   And Europe, well, I went to study abroad there for a semester and I left my heart there, but their age of consent is bad judgement in my opinion.  


Being that according to what I have read, the brain won't be fully developed until a person is in their 20s, I don't think it should be 16 at all. Now, this could be wrong, I don't have the source, but I have read reports that the part of the teen brain that's not yet fully developed is the frontal lobe, the part dealing with judgement, impulse control, judgment, and emotional control. So when teenagers engage in risky behavior, it's not just that they don't have enough experience to know better, but their brains can't fully understand the consequences yet.

So, in my opinion the risk v benefit ratio is outweighed by the danger of exposing teenagers to circumstances they're not fully prepared to deal with, be it sex, be it driving, drinking, etc.  Which reminds me how weird it is that one can drive, vote and even join the military at such a young age, but can't have a beer before the age of 21.
