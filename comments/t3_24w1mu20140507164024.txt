Could it be that you have nothing left to strive for? This definitely happened to me, and I did seek therapy because damn, that can't be it, you know? It is slowly helping.

You did everything you are supposed to do. Now, though, you need to focus on what you WANT to do. It is really hard for me to think that way so... I understand your feelings.

I hope things get better for you. :)
