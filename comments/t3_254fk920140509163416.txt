Oh, not in comparison to Goldiblox (trust me, ask my mother about my rant with goldiblox and how they're waaaaay too simple) but in comparison to other LEGO sets.

But I admit I don't know the current state of most LEGO sets (I still play with LEGO, but it's mostly Mindstorms which are the programmable variety of LEGO) so maybe they've dumbed down the unisex ones too.
