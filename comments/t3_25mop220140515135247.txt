Well, you can't make someone love them self if they don't want to. Sometimes it's really hard to accept, but self esteem has to start from within, and you can't force someone to start to love what they see in the mirror until they are ready. You can be supportive, and you can offer all the tools at your disposal for their use, but you can't fix people.
