And when your baby arrives, you'll probably change or strengthen your views. 

It's one thing to read about "pregnancy" in a textbook, to see ladies smuggling beach balls at the grocery store, and watch the usual 5 minute panic we see in movies, loosely depicting birth. It's quite another to experience it all for yourself. There is so much that nobody tells you, or that you really have to experience to understand. 

In early pregnancy, feeling sick, I found I really sympathized with abortion. Why on earth should a woman have to go through this involuntarily? Later, as the baby grew and started to move, the feeling changes. I'm not alone, I have a little person in there. He kicks back when I push on him. He's real, there's just this bit of flesh between him and the world. And as things grew more awkward in the last few weeks, once again, I was just looking to the prize. I get a baby at the end, so I can get through this.

And when you hold *your own*, it's hard to believe anyone wouldn't want that. Knowing what it is to hold your own newborn, it puts that much more gravity on choosing not to go through with a pregnancy. You are giving up the most wonderful feeling, the greatest love.

But then I think, how horrible if I weren't in a position to care for my kids? If I held this baby for a day and had to give her away? Or if I had no husband to support me while I cared for her, forcing me back to work? Or even, if I already had enough children, if this one would push me over the edge of sanity. If this child was not a thing to love but an incredible burden, a person so deserving of love but not getting any from its own mother because of the inopportune situation. 

Man, it's hard. We all stand somewhere on it, and I think as we become mothers, our hearts just ache all around for other women who have to make such hard decisions. .... or if they're easy decisions, the ignorance of what they're missing out on.
