I fight in a medieval combat organization, and I constantly get harassed for wearing sweat pants and a t-shirt instead of period-appropriate garb.  My attitude is much like hers - I'm here to swing a sword at my friends and become a better fighter, what the hell does my clothing have to do with it?

The counter-argument is that garb is basically a uniform that you're expected to wear on the field, and if you only care about the fighting and not the surrounding culture, you're not really playing the same game as everyone else.  The same definitely applies here - the BAFTA's have a high-fashion cultural tradition.  I would argue that in both cases, the culture should be changed... but still, it's a bit disingenuous to act shocked or surprised that the culture exists, and has expectations of you.
