I already have crohns disease so I know I'll have it rough.

And I already don't clean so I know my SO will (and he does)

So at least there's that. I'm thinking about hiring a maid once a month to do some of the more deep cleaning. I'm getting a career because of my ambition and drive and can surely spend a few hundred bucks a year to get a weight lifted off my shoulders.
