This sub has handled the defaulting so well! This is really great. As another guy who agrees with OP about this sub, we have got your back. We are 100% behind you in your efforts to not let this sub turn to shit. And TBH, [it is really nice to see open and honest discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/254gju/mrw_i_checked_twox_this_morning_and_the_top_post/chds9k0) like these here, slightly horrifying yet quite interesting as they might be.
