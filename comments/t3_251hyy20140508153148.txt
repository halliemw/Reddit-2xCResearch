I am old enough to not only have lived through some of the troubles but also have close family members who were in the RUC or army during that time. Unfortunately you are correct that it would be pretty disastrous for them to force anything in the way I suggested, it's simply something I wish *could* happen. Though I do feel there should be *some* way to ensure the rights of those of us who live here - I don't consider it acceptable that we are lacking in these rights compared to the rest of the UK.
