Woah, that's terrifying! I must say you handled yourself very well, though. I agree with PrettyNightSky below, you should carry mace around. Even if you don't use it, it's a great comfort just to know it's there. It's the spare tire of the self-defense world. 

It really sucks that we women have to deal with this stuff on such a regular basis. I hope you can start to feel safe walking to your car again.
