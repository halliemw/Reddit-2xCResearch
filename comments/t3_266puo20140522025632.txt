She is asking a LOT of her bridesmaids. I mean, it is the couple's day, not yours, you should be paying for a dress within your means and she shouldn't be throwing the bachelorette party herself, it's supposed to be something the bridesmaids put on for her- a four day binge in another city is crazy when people are just starting out working and just got out of college.

There is no way your parents should have to pay for a dress. And whatever you do for you vacation should have no bearing on what you can pay for a bachelorette party.

I'd write her a note saying something like this:

Dear (Bride):

Thank you very much for considering me as a bridesmaid, we've been friends since high school and I appreciate you thought of me! But I'm just getting back on my feet after college with a new job, I won't be able to get time off from work for the party, fittings, and other obligations before the wedding, so I have to regretfully decline. I figured you should know in plenty of time to ask someone else who can fulfill the duties and get everything ordered in time. Thanks again for asking me, I'm really sorry, I wish circumstances were different!
