I prefer real controlled studies to blogs when I make my health decisions. Sure he's a doctor, but so are some anti-vaccine people and people who hold a whole host of unhealthy beliefs. I have nothing against keto in general and I'm not really trying to tell you you'll hurt your baby or be a bad mother or anything if you do keto during your next pregnancy, and keto is objectively good for people with certain issues. I just haven't seen anything proving its safety during pregnancy in any sort of study, and certain cell types rely on glucose exclusively for their energy. Certainly your liver can undergo gluconeogenesis to fulfill the needs of one human body, but would it strain your liver to provide for you and a fetus? Would that be stressful for the fetus? We don't know and can't know without actual studies being done. Hopefully someone decides to do a retroactive study soon, since keto has become more popular and there must be some population of pregnant women on a keto diet. They could never do a typical prospective study with what's currently published, because no IRB will approve a study based on something that caused negative effects in pregnancy in animal trials.
