Call the EEOC or your state commission that investigates civil rights complaints.  Potential employers cannot consider your marital status in hiring decisions.  Nothing may come of this complaint but if there are additional issues down the road with others then the agency in charge of investigating complaints will at least have a prior record from that employer.
