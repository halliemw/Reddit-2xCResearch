I personally think that the "void" you're talking about is quite obviously the older man you met before and "hooked up" with. I assume hooking up with means you had sex, and those were most likely the best memories you've had with a man. Try to create memories that are unrelated to sex, go out, even with friends that are male. Open yourself up to opportunities that don't mean you have to sexually please someone or yourself to feel wanted.

That aside, you wanting to feel some love in the form of sex is not unusual and does not make you a slut. You are expressing your loneliness and need for interaction. Just try to take it slower with male friends, or new boyfriends. That way the void will be less of a gap between this older guy and sex - and more about nostalgia of moments past.

These apps like tinder are there mostly for doing what you have done (not in all cases). Take the time to go out with these college friends to places you enjoy. Hopefully through this you can pick up the confidence to find new guys to spend time with and hopefully this leads to fulfilling that feeling. It's hard, but if you can't enjoy being with yourself first, then how can you expect others to. You have more to offer than your sex skills. Save them for someone who cares.
