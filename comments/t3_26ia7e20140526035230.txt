I like the round shape they give my boobs. It's completely superficial, which I feel a little bad about, but eh. I don't wear them with thick shirts where that effect is gained by just the heavy fabric squishing my boobs down. I don't wear them at home, generally. It's never been a huge deal for me either way. 

34Bish for the record. So, not very big at all.
