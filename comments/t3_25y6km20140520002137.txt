> Banning all abortion is fucking ridiculous, our bodies do that shit all the time

People die from natural causes all the time, even young people. That doesn't make it ok to kill them.

>  we are ONE SCOTUS appointee from this happening in the US.

Laws in America before abortion was legal targeted abortionists, not women. There isn't a single case of a woman being indicted for procuring an abortion in America.
