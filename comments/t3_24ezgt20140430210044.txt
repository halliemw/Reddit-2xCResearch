Those are totally valid reasons, but, in society, you can't expect the general public or large institutions and organizations that are not specialized in criminal investigations to make judgments of criminal guilt and hand down punishments appropriate for those crimes.

I agree it'd be good for the university to hand down harsher punishments for people they *know* are guilty of serious crimes, but if they're just kinda, pretty sure, they kind of have to balance their certainty of guilt of certain crimes against the seriousness of the crimes.

If you're only 60% sure someone committed blah, blah violation, you're more likely to punish them less harshly than if you were 99% sure.
