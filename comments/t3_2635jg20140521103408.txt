Definitely sounds like some sort of dyspareunia. Not vaginismus since you can still have sex (penetration). I have dyspareunia too and it's only now going away. Turns out my pelvic floor muscles are out of wack and need to be fixed. Gyno recommended me to a pelvic floor therapist and the pain is almost gone now! So it could be that your superficial pelvic floor muscles (the outer part, initial insertion) are in poor shape. I recommend pelvic floor stretches and deep breathing. My therapist gave me a dilator (a little stick you press on the painful points) which also really helped. Anyways, from my experience that's what really helped me, yours may be similar.
