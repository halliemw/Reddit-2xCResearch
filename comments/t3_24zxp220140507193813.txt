Re: #2: twox and places like it are places where women can vent without having to justify their views. Men get a lot of places like that. I see posts in subs like askmen etc. all the time like "my lady cheated" or "this girl i like is dating another guy" or stuff like that. If you had a comment like that to make to your friends, regardless of gender, would it be a helpful or useful or at all wanted response for someone to say "not all women are like that!" Like, OK? But I'm not talking about all women. I'm talking about one. And that one hurt me and I'm upset. I'm not trying to make statements about all people of a certain gender.
