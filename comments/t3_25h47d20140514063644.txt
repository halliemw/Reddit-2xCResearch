Why wouldn't you bring self defense into it then? I understand that it *shouldn't* be this way, but it is. I can only help by not raping people and encouraging others to do the same. If you are afraid, learning how to defend yourself is a great step in being less afraid. No, you shouldn't have to, but that would be preventative action instead of reactionary. 

I don't think I should change my life just because I have enhanced ability to rape someone. Ability != intent. If a woman is being "bitchy" at me, I'm not going to *avoid* calling her a bitch so she doesn't fear me. My personal response to antagonism of any kind is to ask the person to stop, and if they don't, leave. If they follow, I do whatever is necessary in order to get away. Like the Power Rangers, I don't escalate the level of conflict unless it is necessary, like your dog comparison.

The risks you talk about are the risks of human interaction, and a big part of why I avoid it as much as possible. I also don't really like being awake and sober at the same time due to a mood disorder. I was involuntarily institutionalized and medicated, so I get the whole "feeling like a victim" thing. Sometimes, the system in place simply isn't effective. When that happens, we have a choice: Change the system, or work outside of it. 

In order to eliminate rape entirely, we'd probably need to violate human rights on a much broader (but less individually harmful) scale. There will be people willing to commit violent/sexual acts as long as humanity is the way it currently is. In a perfect world, it wouldn't happen, but this is not a perfect world. I fully support trying as hard as we can to make it that way, but it is important to be realistic.
