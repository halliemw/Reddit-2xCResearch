Is she an "early" bloomer though?  I think plenty of girls start puberty by at least 9:

it's sweet you're worried for her, but blood on the pants and teasing from class mates is part of growing up.  It's not going to break her.  

I guess part of your concern is it sounds (no offense) like you were a late bloomer yourself.  Honestly, by the time I was 11 all of my friends had their periods and were wearing training bras.  

And again - no offense at all - I would mostly be concerned about her getting a "worried" vibe from you and start to think any of these changes are unusual.  They're not.  You're probably just used to thinking of her as a little girl.  She still is - but her body is developing as it should.  

Tell her these changes are normal and you are available to talk to her if she needs.  Get her a book on puberty so she can get answers on her own.  

also, btw - a sudden and keen interest in bathing all of a sudden?  I mean, I don't know your sister, but when I started spending a shit ton of time in the bathroom at that age - I wasn't exactly washing my hair the whole time.
