This. A thousand times this. I've lived science my whole life. I've had things said to me no one ever says to a man ('what do you know?' Etc). When I'm in a group most of the men try to pretend I'm not there. If I speak up they'll just pretend they didn't hear and continue the conversation. I've learned that I have to be 100% right if I speak up at all or I'll get torn to shreds. 
I even get comments from some of the women I know. Like 'why would you want to do that?' When I talk about science. 
I think it's made me a better scientist, but at the same time I wish I could be granted a little respect for all my hard work.
