Here is my opinion on the situation as OP describes: It appears more thought out or a pattern if he wouldn't show his phone pics for her to see it was 'a one time' thing. He does not need to be a sociopath/pathological anti-social for him to violate the rights of others. In terms of considering his ignorance or giving him a break I believe this:   An explanation for the behavior does not excuse what occurred or mean he has some right for her to repair the relationship.
