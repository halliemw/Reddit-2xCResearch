I disagree entirely. The objection is with the trait these women carry, not with the fact that they are women.

The trend in changing the term misogyny to mean something other than it's original and intended meaning is not something I believe should happen or that it is happening naturally. A lot of it has to do with hyperbolic clickbaiting on the internet and those with a name and shame agenda.

I have seen the holding prejudice definition a few times, most notably in the Oxford dictionary, my issue with that is we are blurring the lines between misogyny and sexism. Sexism is a word specifically designed to deal with that issue and deals with it much better and more clearly

 mid 17th century: from Greek misos 'hatred' + gunÄ“ 'woman'.
