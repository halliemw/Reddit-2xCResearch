It's nice to see others tackling this situation. My SO and I have arguments over this pretty regularly. Essentially he seems to have no problem living in filth (he frequently doesn't even put wrappers and rubbish in the bin) and I'd like a clean, tidy house. He'll happily help, but only when I tell him what to do. This is frustrating, having worked professionally in a kitchen together, as I know he can take the initiative. I'm terrible for butting in to try to help him do things better and I'm trying to back off there, but I just don't feel like he makes any effort to take on tasks himself. When I ask for his perspective he pretty much just tells me he doesn't like doing it, he's tired or doesn't think it's that messy. It gets so stressful having to do my job and organise both our lives.
