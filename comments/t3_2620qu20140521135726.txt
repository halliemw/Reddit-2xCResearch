no, i don't. the judge does. but it's pretty clear the right decision is for the man to go to jail. if he had been murdering people for years, that's what would have happened. no one would be arguing "but his children would grow up without a father!" so i have to wonder what's special about rapists and the crime of rape that makes it so insignificant to you that this father should not be in jail for the sake of his children.
