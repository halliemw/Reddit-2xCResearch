It's not "naivete".  People *should* feel free and encouraged to make friends and connect with people.  Even teenagers.  Nearly everyone does this, everywhere.  When one of those people turns out to be untrustworthy and does something inappropriate, you don't turn around and ask "how did you find yourself in these circumstances, you have some explaining to do."  You focus on the person who did the inappropriate thing.  They're the one who did something they shouldn't.
