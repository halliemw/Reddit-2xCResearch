OK, everyone already has said, call the bride. Actually I wouldn't be surprised if she is pissed off right now because you haven't sent the RSVP back and now she thinks you are blowing off her wedding and how dare you. I've had invitations lost in the mail once or twice in the last few years and often the bride is calling to see where the RSVP went to.
