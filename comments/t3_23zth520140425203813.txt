Thanks! The liner on my left eye wasn't as good, but I managed to salvage it slightly :P

I use Maybelline Dream Matte mousse (10 Ivory). I like it, it's pretty good. I tried using a brush to apply it, then I gave up and just used my fingers.. I'm always on the hunt for new brands to try out, though.

**Edit:** Haha, I figured I'd post the whole album there :)

I'm just starting, will get to start HRT by the end of this year, hopefully! I came out this a few months ago.

And haha, I have some prior experience with brushes, I painted miniatures for a few years, so I have an eye for detail I suppose :P But thank you, though! Always nice to hear :D
