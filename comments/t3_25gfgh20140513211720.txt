>I made many long-term, beautiful friendships half a lifetime ago, but I feel that if I had been a conventionally attractive teenager, the dynamics of these friendships would have been entirely different. 

As a chubster girl myself, I completely agree with this, but I have a point to say: If you were an attractive teen, maybe all of those long-term friendships would have not existed. They would have been interested in only dating you, and if you refused, talk behind your back about how stupid and shallow you are. We all know how teenagers are.

In retrospective, I'm actually glad I was pretty average back then.
