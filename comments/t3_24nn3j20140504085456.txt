I haven't read the original study, but *usually* people who make these studies are really good at covering their bases. That is, I am fairly certain they have made serious attempts to "normalize" their data based on the gender and race of both applicants AND those reviewing applicants.

On related note, there was an article in PNAS a couple of years back where a similar study was made. That study showed, that white males were preferred and equally so by female and male reviewers. With help of data analysis as well as pre-existing litterature, the author(s) suggested that this preference is NOT conscious and intentional. Rather, it has to do with stereotypes we associate with gender and race.
