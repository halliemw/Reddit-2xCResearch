For me growing up, any woman related issues I had, I would go to my Mom. Just because it was more comfortable that way, and even though I knew my dad would talk to me and help me out with anything, I knew he wouldn't necessarily *want* to do it. 

That being said, love her- so hard. Love your daughter and wife, and enjoy the ride that is coming your way. Sometimes a new baby can be stressful, and sometimes your wife will be stressed out because of the baby (ex. Baby won't stop crying). Just being there and being supportive is such a huge factor of the role you play. 

The fact that you're even worried about being the best father you can be is a good sign in the right direction. Do what your gut tells you, and never treat your daughter like a "dick." Haha.
