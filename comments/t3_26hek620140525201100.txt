This sari is almost 30 years old. Today's fashions involve softer, thinner, more translucent fabrics that flow and mold to the body's contours. They also involve less intricate embroidery but favor delicate bead work and mixing textiles (I think velvet trim is in now). Both are beautiful in their own way! It's totally cool by me to call it an outfit. It is, after all, a crop top, a skirt, and a *very* long scarf!
