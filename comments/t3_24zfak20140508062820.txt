Based on what? What are they going to do about it? Go mad with power? It's a crock of shit and everyone knows it. Other mods from subs that refused default status have commented and refuted their claims, stating that they were approached with reasonable time, are given the opportunity to reject default status and do not have to remain silent. The mods here are just selfish fucking liars and honestly I could not be angrier with them right now.
