Im a guy....so im sure everyone will hate me regardless of what i say. He is probably very edgy due to the job thing. Ive been injured an unable to work and even with legit reasons for not being there was very down about it all and hated every second i wasnt able to contribute. Being said maybe your not seeing your hand in all this....you threw things to start but he's beserk when he does it....doesnt excuse eiher party....both were wrong....you issue is he shuts down when confronted...yet in your post you admit to doing same thing. Not blaminhg you, but arguements go both ways...
