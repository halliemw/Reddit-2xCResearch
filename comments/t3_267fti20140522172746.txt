Where religion discusses philosophy and moral teaching, you are correct, it serves a different function to science. Where religion makes specific claims about the nature of the universe, its creation, and deities intervening in affairs, such claims can be tested empirically and they are highly likely to conflict with what centuries of scientific testing tell us. If a religion deals with those conflicts by acknowledging the scientific view is correct and saying "hey, we don't actually MEAN it, it's all metaphor, don't you know", then fine.
