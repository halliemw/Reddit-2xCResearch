It is possible to start a puberty transition that early and it be perfectly normal. However, if both sides of her family started later than that it could be an external issue. Dont freak, but if she has had any contact w hormonal supplements it can start an early trigger process. The one popping in my head is male testosterone creams and gels. It may be worth it to look thru your home and talk to the dad about his home. Those supplements look to most like normal lotion or cream bottles. If she used any it could trigger. Or if she even came in contact w fabrics that had some from earlier use, it could trigger early puberty. If you do talk to her dad about it, try to do it out of her ear shot so as not to embarrasss her in case it pans out to be nothing.
But 8 is not entirely unheard of for beginning the process.
