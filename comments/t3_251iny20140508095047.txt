Have you considered a quick trip (or two, but not many) to a couple's counselor or an individual counselor to help you process these feelings? I don't think you are wrong to feel how you feel or to establish those boundaries. 

There is definitely a line re: emotional fidelity that got crossed if that woman thinks it is appropriate to talk about your boyfriend that way. Lies of omission *are* dishonesty. This sounds like a situation that escalated and he knew better but didn't want to/know how to back out.

He might need to figure out why he did this. Could you talk about coping skills in the future for this or a plan of action/how to recognize if things are going in an inappropriate direction? 

I'm very impressed that you are willing to try to forgive and move past this. I'm so sorry you are having to go through this :( I clink my internet wine glass with yours in a toast to tomorrow being better than today.
