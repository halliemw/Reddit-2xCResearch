> cups of clear liquid mixed with other people's, add indicator an the pink ones have STDs

Yeah, I have used this in my bio class.  Mainly to de-stigmatize STIs.  Wait, you only had sex with one person, who has only had sex with one person?  You still can get an STI.  HIV, etc. is not a mark of promiscuousness.

(And also to scare the living beejeezus out of them so they always wear condoms.  Sorry, my personal agenda.)
