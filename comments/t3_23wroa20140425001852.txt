My brother did the exact same thing to me! I am so glad I have someone else that has endured the frustration and confusion. My two best friends in high school were gay/lesbian and I was and am very outspoken about LGBQ rights because of it. So apparently since I was maybe 17 until now at 23 my brother had told all our family friends and family that I was gay. However I didn't get reassurance and all the accepting love (my brother is an asshole). So I just snapped and screamed at him and also told him that it was highly inappropriate, whether gay/straight/bisexual, it is  to automatically define SOMEONE ELSE'S sexuality. 

I think a lot of this stems from people trying to label you, no matter their good or bad intentions. Society is so jacked.
