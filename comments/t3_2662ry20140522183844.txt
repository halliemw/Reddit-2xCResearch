Don't feel awful. My first time sounds the same as yours. 

The guy was much larger than average and I lasted perhaps ten seconds. You probably bled because he tore you. 

I didn't try again for at least a week. It isn't a miraculous thing, sex. It becomes good -after you get used to that sort of thing-. Don't feel bad at all. It is not your responsibility as a newcomer to sex to make him finish--that comes with mutual work and a great deal more practice. Work on being comfortable.
