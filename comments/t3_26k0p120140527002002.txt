You sound like a good person, and thats great and all, but there is clearly an imbalance here.

If youre spending all this time and effort just so he can have fun, he should be incredibly grateful for it. *He* should want to talk to *you* about all this to make sure youre ok with it, simply because youre taking on so many of his parenting obligations if nothing else. If your relationship is truly how you say, you should never have had to come onto the internet about this in the first place.

Unless hes completely oblivious, he should be aware of the problem just as much as you are. It should be his problem too! If you truly care about your significant other, you dont let things like this just slide... not for six years. 

At the absolute best he is neglecting you as a friend. And unless hes an idiot, he probably knows it. It doesnt really matter what the worst case scenario is. Either way your relationship has some serious things to work out before you can honestly say you are best friends. 

I hope its as simple as that. Good luck. 

Edit: Also, I see you asking if this is normal a lot. 'Normal' shouldnt matter. How you feel is what should matter to him. If youre best friends with 100% trust, he should be invested in your feelings, no matter how trivial. If the situation were switched, would you care about his concerns? It should be the same for him to you.
