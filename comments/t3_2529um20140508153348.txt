I really appreciate your insights on this.  In all honesty he was going through so much transition, it's possible he didn't exactly know what he wanted relationship-wise.  He was twice divorced and both marriages had ended badly, which of course should have been a red flag but I had my love-goggles on...sigh.  Thanks for your input.
