I'm going to be the Patty Pessimist here, sorry friends. 

TLDR; if you want to put a female in a suit, do it right, or you are just furthering sexist clothing type problems. 

It's great that they have a strong young lady in a great looking PANT suit. This is huge. SO many people still think that skirt suits and hosiery are the only appropriate professional attire for women. As someone going into the "white collar + suit is a must" industry, it is still hard to find any kind of suit for a woman, including a skirt suit. By suit I mean that the fabric that the jacket is made from is the same fabric that the bottoms are made from. otherwise it a coat and bottoms, not a suit. 

HOWEVER, here is the pessimistic part, this is not a functional suit, and this is not a appropriate suit. It is not functional as it has no pockets. UGH. Woman have to carry things too, like wallets and phones, and papers. It is NOT always ok to carry a purse. Why do our suits have no pockets, when men have 4 pockets on their pants and 2 outer coat pockets, and 2 inner coat pockets? Also, our suits are always cut to be less that functional, pencil skirts are not good for lifting and moving and walking. This suit does not have crisp pants, and is made out of a satin like fabric, therefore this suit cannot be taken seriously as a real suit. This furthers the idea that women do not have real jobs that require real suits.  "Oh, but if you want a good suit, you should have it tailored." Yeah, sure, but why should I have to have every suit hand designed and made for me when men do not have to, to have a functional suit. 

It's pictures like this that make me cringe, and keep shitty suits on the racks of every department store. VIVA LA SUIT REVOLUTION!
