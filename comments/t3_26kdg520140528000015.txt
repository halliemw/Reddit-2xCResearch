I'm a 28-30 G-H depending on the bra, and having the right bra makes all the difference.

Also, no one is going to know what size bra you're wearing unless you tell them. 

I'm a daddy's girl and I know that if I told my dad that I needed bras that fit he would have taken me to the mall asap to get some. He really felt that we should have things that we needed, and honestly, having bras that fit are absolutely necessary.
