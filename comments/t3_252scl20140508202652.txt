Agreed, /r/Feminism is already a thing that has a sidebar for those interested. Besides, it won't reduce uneducated comments to post the same material in the side bar. If they cared about women's rights, they would be reading about that, not trolling a girl's subreddit.

Edit: Gotta love that about this subreddit. See an unpopular opinion? Downvote with no rational response.
