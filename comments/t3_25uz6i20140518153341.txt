> PS: you might not feel anything with sex the first time. Just keep trying!

This is so true! For the first 10-15 times I had sex it didn't feel good at all, just kind of blah. I was sincerely confused as to why people liked it so much. Then eventually it just kind of clicked and started feeling amazing.
