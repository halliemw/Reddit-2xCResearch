One of the biggest issues facing individuals who were sexually abused as children is the self blame.  Even when they go to therapy that focuses on how it wasn't their fault, they still tend to hold feelings of self blame.  This is likely a major issue for your boyfriend, so if you ever see him blaming himself for anything that happened, don't let him continue such a line of thought.

Second, just because your boyfriend and his dad seem to have a reasonable relationship (minus the above incident), don't assume that it mustn't have been that bad.  A sexually abused child has no standard pattern to react.  Some may hate their abuser, others may love them.  Others may feel emotions that for many of us are beyond comprehension (especially when the molester is someone close).

Third, if you want to help your boyfriend more, consider contacting a counselor yourself and asking a professional what you should do.  Do not try to trick you boyfriend into therapy, just tell them what you know and get a professional opinion as to how to proceed.
