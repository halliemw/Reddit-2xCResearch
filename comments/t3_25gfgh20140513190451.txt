Wow this was a powerful scene. It's something I've dealt with for a long time, and I'm not even a fat girl. I was a fat boy/kid, and am now just a chubby dude, but I've always liked girls who would be considered fat. And it sucks because girls think you must be weird for liking them BECAUSE they're fat, and even just saying "fat girls" is kind of offensive. I mean, how are you supposed to say that to people? Oh, yeah, that girl over there is okay but really I'm not that attracted to her. If she were maybe 50 pounds heavier I would be though. When I was younger, I used to feel like I couldn't be with a fat girl, for the same reason that the character in Louis says. It's not the really good looking guys who shut fat girls out, it's the ones with low self confidence. It's really unfair. The last year or so though, I have had the confidence to be somewhat open about who I am, with my friends at least, but I still feel like I'm doing a disservice to women who aren't thin. (okay, really, what am I supposed to call them? I feel like an ass for saying "fat girls" and it feels patronizing to say "big girls." They're just women to me, but at the same time there's still a distinction between "thin girls" and "fat girls" where they can't just be girls.)

Sorry for rambling, and I'm not even a girl. If someone could give me some advice on this, I would appreciate it, because I really want to do right by others but for the last 18 years of my life, I've never once just been able to have an honest no bullshit talk about it with another person before.
