I think that's all great and I'm glad these topics are going to get out there more, but it's just really jarring to have the sub shift dramatically like that. Many women who post here aren't trying to change minds or knock down sexist ideas, they're scared and they want advice or support from a community that's pretty nice overall. And with the open minded readers are the trolls and misogynists who want to make people feel bad. So to get a tangible benefit taken away for this nice idea of women's issues being more widely read.
