I haven't lied about anything.

That isn't the same guy. I'm not super proud of the fact that I'm sleeping with multiple people at the same time,and it wasn't relevant to this story,but now that you browsed my past posts,I have to explain myself. I'm a whore obviously,but I'm not a liar.

Yeah. I'm fucking skinny,but I'm working on loving my body. EVERYONE struggles with their body image. I'm not going to lie,that was a bad day when I posted that question. I felt gross,and I needed to vent. Are you telling me that you never have days where you feel unattractive? Really?

I wasn't dishonest about anything,there were certain details of this story that weren't relevant,like the fact that I'm sleeping with multiple people,but now that you felt like being fucking Sherlock Holmes of Reddit,I had to explain myself. Thanks.
