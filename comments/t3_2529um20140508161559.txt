Dear Mortified,

I'm sorry you had to go through that.  Meeting new people and opening up your heart is a risk, and you should be proud that you were brave enough to take that risk.  You are not repulsive, or love-blind.  If anything, HE misled you by pretending to be a "good man".  Even if he realized upon meeting you that there was no physical attraction, he didn't have to a) turn into a jerk and start snapping at you, b) have sex with you several times, and d) start cringing upon your touch.  This is not consistent with the behaviour of a good person.  

There could be many reasons why he decided he wasn't attracted to you, and they have nothing to do with you being repulsive.  Maybe your [scents weren't compatible](http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200712/scents-and-sensibility). But it doesn't even matter why.  The point is he chose to react the way he did because he is an asshole.  It's not about you.  In fact, it sounds like you are doing great without him.  Imagine if he had kept pretending? You could have gotten sucked into a horribly abusive relationship.

For what it's worth, you're better off without him and now you know how to recognize one more brand of jerk ;)
