so in the article she cited [this site](http://www.vox.com/2014/5/2/5672942/girls-have-gotten-better-grades-than-boys-for-100-years) that explains that girls have been doing better than boys for a long while, so it's those boys from 20 years ago who are competing as men with women in the current marketplace too.  

Personally, I agree with a person who commented on the original article, that it probably can be correlated with the culture of teaching girls to be obedient and demure, but of course that's just pure speculation on my and their part.
