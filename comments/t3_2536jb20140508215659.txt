I hear ya, thanks for sharing. I feel really wired right now mentally, but physically I'm really tired. It's really confusing and I don't like it. It gets worse in the evening, usually a few hours before I take my birth control. That's why I was asking if other people noticed a connection. It's nice not being completely exhausted when I get home from work but I also don't like how I don't feel like I have an off switch. I'm not hyperactive or anything, just feels like my brain is ON and there's no OFF switch.
