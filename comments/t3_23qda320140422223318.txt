It's totally understandable that you are disappointed. As for the prom, you should just try to make the best of it. Of course it's sad that your boyfriend can't go, but still try to enjoy it anyways. If you don't, then you'll be the only one suffering, you know? Do you have a guy friend you could go with? Or just go with your friends? I promise you'll still have fun, you just have to let go of how you expected it to be and allow yourself to have a different, but equally fun, experience. People will say that prom isn't important, and that's true, but it's still a great experience that you should have if you want to! I can think of tons of things that I wouldn't care much about now but I'm glad I did at the time, because it was a great experience! :) 

Beyond that, if you feel really burned by all this (which you have every right to feel) then definitely keep going with it and do your best to settle it. It seems like more than anything, you're bothered that he went back on his word to you without a second thought - and it's made worse by him going to prom with that girl before. If you allow yourself to simply continue feeling like your boyfriend wasn't considerate of your feelings, you will resent him and always go back to it. 

 I had a very similar situation happen to me with my long term boyfriend in high school, and I never really hashed it out with him. As a result, I resented him and always questioned how he felt about me because of it. It ended up being a huge factor in us breaking up. 

Good luck! Your prom will be amazing as long as you let it be! Don't worry!
