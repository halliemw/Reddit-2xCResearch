Haha "try" might be the wrong word here. For me, sex is just a fun activity that two consenting adults can do. It feels good, it requires a certain amount of trust, and it exposes an aspect of each participant that most people don't get to see. But it doesn't go anywhere after that. 

Beyond those initial effects from the first few encounters, I don't experience any further bonding or emotional changes the more sex I have with someone. If that's even really a thing. I would assume even for couples it's activities outside of sex that do that, generally?

Edit: gotta go to bed for now. Happy to continue tomorrow, as you all seem like interesting people. Night!
