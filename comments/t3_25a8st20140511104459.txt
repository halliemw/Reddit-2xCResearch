My boyfriend and I used to joke that I had an angry ovary because every other month I wanted to kill myself from the pain.  (Yes, it goes all the way down the front of my thighs, too.)

And then a few times a year I have a super period.  I remember sitting on a hotel room floor trying not to scream for hours, eating Advil like popcorn.  

The only thing that works for me is consistent ibuprofen intake, from before pain starts and never letting the pain return.  

In the worst throes, getting friendly with a vibrator helps a lot.  

I have no answer with the doctor thing though...
