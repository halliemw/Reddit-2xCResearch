hey..don't discount the calculator, and don't be afraid of that F.  It may very well be true that you are a 28F.  BUT, you must remember that a 28F is not the same as a 40F.  Those F cup sizes are different.  By finding a bra that fits *you*, specifically, you will help your posture as you are growing.  It's super important!
