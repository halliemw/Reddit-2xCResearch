My family lost my mother in the same situation. I was 5, my sister 9. I know that with my sister and I any mementos were and are cherished. I once found a letter from my mother to my grandmother talking about how her day was going.. that letter meant so much to me and still does. I would read it often just to see her handwriting and feel the warmth of her happiness in it. Just talk from your heart, talk about who you are and what you like, that is such a beautiful gift you can give to your children. I wish my mom had been able to write to me -knowing what her favourite things were, her favourite memories with her friends, the name of her first crush or best friend, that is just as important to me as knowing how to face lifes big events. I hope this helps a little and thank you.
