This place isn't always about "discussion," whatever that is.  If the "discussion" breaks the rules in the sidebar to your right (and I believe that some of this is a community value, what is deemed respectful here is up to the mods)...then it goes.

It doesn't even matter if it "adds" or "subtracts" to the "discussion."  I think it should be *clear,* (which your post is not), *well-reasoned* and free of drama-inducing generalizations.  

I disagree that feelings can be wrong (which system of ethics are you coming from anyway?  Kantian, surely not...Aristotelian, surely not.  I have never, in any science or philosophy, seen any reputable person say that feelings can be *wrong.*  They can be weak or strong, they can be transient or enduring.

But the domain of right and wrong is about action, not feelings.  If you can't understand a simple distinction (between action and feeling), while I think you are welcome to continue posting, I also think you're going to get a lot of pushback.

As to "pertinence," you'd have to establish that the class of "being man" had meaningful relevance first.  Not all men have the same beliefs, feelings, or views about things.  To say otherwise is non-rational, and well, very close to baiting if the person you're responding to is already in an emotional state (which I assume you are not particularly good at discerning, given what you've said here so far).
