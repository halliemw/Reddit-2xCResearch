Maybe it turns him on sexually to hear about your sexual past? Cuckoldry is a real fetish... 

But even if that's true, it's very different ( to me ) than being turned on or titillated by the hurts you've undergone. I know how easy it is to react in a strongly negative way to actions that you perceive as being similar to your abusers' actions (or maybe abuser's). I've been there. The strength of the response is confusing for a person who hasn't been abused; it's very difficult to understand the depths of emotion that are involved unless you've been there. 

Personally, I doubt that he is fetishizing your pain. He doesn't sound like a sadist.
