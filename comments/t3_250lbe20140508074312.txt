I knew someone who had thin hair kept short and she just swore up and down that the only way that she felt her hair could be done was by bleaching and frying the shit out of it.

One day someone convinced her to stop and it just looks **so** much better. It's still fine and thin but now it's shiny and bouncy and grows much better.
