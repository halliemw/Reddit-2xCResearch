I haven't read it myself, but it's good to know from someone who has read the whole thing that this message carries throughout. All I'd seen up until now was an isolated quote or two that was misogynistic along with other isolated quotes that weren't. It's nice to hear from somebody who has actually read the whole manifesto who can verify that this message is present in the whole thing.

I would also like to thank you for addressing my comment and presenting evidence to correct it instead of dismissing it, sidestepping it, or insulting it.
