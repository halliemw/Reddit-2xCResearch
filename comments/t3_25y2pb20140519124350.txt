I wanted to how many games I could find on Steam with a female lead and ended up with a list of almost 200. Which sounds good until you realize Steam has more than 4,000 games (can't find the true number) and most of the games with female leads are point and click or hidden object games.

To comment on the 45% statistic: it really bothers me that the company who did the study didn't post anywhere (that I could find) what percentage of these gamers were mobile gamers. They had in 2004, but not recently. I can't find any studies that reveal the percentage for just computer/console gamers. Although, on the Wikipedia about women in video games it says that women are half of Wii gamers and 38% of Xbox gamers.
