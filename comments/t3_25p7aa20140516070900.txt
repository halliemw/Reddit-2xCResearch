This definitely doesnâ€™t explain all downvotes, but on a recent post on a similar subject to this, I saw a reply that made some sense to me: Because downvotes are also meant for "irrelevant" posts. 

So some people may see an unpopular opinion or an untrue statement and just disagree with it, but others might actually consider it irrelevant to the topic. 

I don't really do that because I think the spirit of the "irrelevant" part means more like "simply doesn't relate in any way to the topic", but I can understand the idea.
