If she can't understand that she's hurting you, she shouldn't be around you.

Then he's an idiot, and he makes you feel bad about yourself. Steer clear of that kind of person, especially in romantic relationships.

You're being vague at best. Chances are, you're projecting your disappointment on them. The first and worst person to put you down is yourself, because no matter what other people say, what you keep from them is repeated in your head over and over again. They all probably care a lot less about it all than you do and than you think. Whatever you decide to do, if you do it for other people's eyes and approbation, you'll always end up disappointed. Not because you won't get it, but because it'll never be good enough.

No one is going to help you stand up if you're trying to drag yourself back down. The first step will always have to come from you, and from the sound of it, you're making excuses for all of them for treating you badly, as if somehow you deserved it. As long as you think like that, it's likely to go on. 

Move.
