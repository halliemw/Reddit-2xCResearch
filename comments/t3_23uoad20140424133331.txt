This is the comment I was scrolling down to find. I'm not exactly entrenched in "geek culture" but this is similar to how I interpreted it (although maybe that makes my perspective on this less relevant). I saw it as being about a specific group of people. They're mentioning the female group on the t-shirt, but it's not about them being women - it's about that fan subset. As someone else pointed out, there's no gender-neutral term for annoying fan people.

I suppose if many other people interpret the shirt as meaning "I hate all fans who are women" then yes that's problematic.
