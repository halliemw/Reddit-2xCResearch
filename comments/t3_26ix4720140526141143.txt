I just think that cheating is better then staying in a relationship you do not want to be.

The last couple of weeks I have browsed this subreddit and relationships subreddit and as soon as something bad happens everyone says to break up.

"I am upset because my spouse didn't care about my feelings this one time." is responded with "leave him now".

Why is cheating any worse then simply leaving the person?
