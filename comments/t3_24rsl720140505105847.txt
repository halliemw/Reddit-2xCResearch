If you are comfortable with this guy and trust him then go for it. Having sex for the first time is not as big of a deal as some make it out to be. 

My first time was with a friend, not a boyfriend. I trusted him enough to go at my pace, and take it slow due to the pain. I have never once regretted doing it this way instead of waiting until I was in love.
