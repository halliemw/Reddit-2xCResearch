Sorry for the late reply! The background check involved collecting information such as name, all addresses in which the person lived within the past five years, and social security number. It was then sent to a company that ran the background checks for us (I worked with Intelius, which later became TalentWise). They would send us back a report with information we requested, which was usually just included any citations or violations that had been filed within the last 10 years. As long as there weren't any violations that were flagrantly offensive (minor traffic violations were usually okay, anything involving violence, alcohol, or drugs was not), we moved on to the reference check.

For the reference check, we usually asked the applicant to submit anywhere between 2 and 4 references, one of whom has known the applicant for X number of years (usually somewhere between 1 and 5, depending on the position). We'd ask these references about the applicant's character, level of personal responsibility, and whether they would trust this person alone with children (the nonprofit I worked for dealt with a lot of children). We also asked about the relationship between the applicant and the reference (how they met, how long they had known each other, etc).

Also, I never had to do this, but I think adding something like a home inspection would be a good idea.
