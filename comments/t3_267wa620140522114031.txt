A basic but significant difference that has an effect on how we perceive the videos: in their own videos, these women are typically the only woman stripping down, and always the focus of attention. In men's videos, the men are typically the focus of attention (the artist is typically the focus of attention in their own music video, makes sense), and the stripped down women are in the background, part of the setting. The difference is what we're paying attention to in the video.


Also, I don't think it's bad to objectify yourself, as long as you also find worth in yourself as a person.
