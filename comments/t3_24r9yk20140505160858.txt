I'm the purveyor of dad jokes in my relationship - 

him: you make no sense. 
me: that's right, I make dollah dollah bills, baby, dollah dollab bills. 
him: just stop.

it's all in good fun, though. I have a distinctly self-deprecating sense of humour and we rib on each other all the time. it's kinda lovely.
