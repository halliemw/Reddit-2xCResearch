It is ok to feel many different emotions, separately, or all at once, or none at all. Everyone heals differently and at their own pace. I hope that you have a support network of people you can rely on. If/when you feel ready, you can find a therapist or support group for grieving spouses. I'm very, very sorry for your loss.
