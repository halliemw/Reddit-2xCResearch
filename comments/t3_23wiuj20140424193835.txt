I work in programming for a small startup along with one other female developer and a bunch of guys. I'm also very active in my local hackerspace, and I'm the only constant female member there and was one of the founding members.

So really I put up with that stuff a lot of the time. There was a guy in work that was really great about the fact that I was just as skilled as him, but he's leaving tomorrow :( And the two other guys who thought similarly have also left this month... I really need a new job.

I get the same attitude at the hackerspace sometimes. Despite the fact that I've been there since before the place ever started, and that I know the majority of people there and what they're doing, people still assume that I don't know how to do stuff or I'm only there because my SO is or I just like male attention -_-
