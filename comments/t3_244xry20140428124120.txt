It isn't though. They have skinny real models, too. They just haven't photoshopped them to look even skinnier and bustier than they really are. That's what OP means by real-size and what Aerie means by real. No one here is saying "real women have curves" or "thin women aren't real." You're getting offended by something no one is implying or saying.
