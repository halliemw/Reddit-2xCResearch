Talk to your doctor, first and foremost. They will be able to give you better advice as they will be familiar with your medical history. 

However, my first suggestion would be looking at changing your BC. That can help immensely when it comes to mood swings and PMS. That doesn't mean you'll have to do anything as drastic as change from the pill to, say, an IUD. Even just changing between brands can help, as each will have slightly different formulations, one of which may work for you. It's mostly just a case of try it and see. 

I would also suggest, at the advice of a doctor, taking some sort of multivitamin. Personally, I take these: http://www.bassettsvitamins.co.uk/products/healthy-balance.ashx?0.305698307231069. I find they have helped immensely with my mood and my appearance (cleared up my bad skin and cracking nails). It contains Vit E, B vitamins, Vit C, Biotin and Oil of the Evening Primrose (a nice source of very important fatty acids). All of these things are important for women in maintaining proper hormonal regulation, especially young women like yourself (and myself).  

However, before you take anything, please talk to your doctor as it could interfere with your BC or cause you more problems.
