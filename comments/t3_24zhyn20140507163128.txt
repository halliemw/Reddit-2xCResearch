Too bad! Ask any parent, they all seem to be winging it. Either way I wouldn't be too worried as she will just want to do what she wants. My Dad had me as his tiny shop shadow and wound up with a daughter that you can hand a roofing nailer too and she will load it up and bump nail down an entire floor. That same daughter also took ballet for years and still dances all the time. Daughters are just people like anyone else.
