I think it's cultural. I definitely not see work out gear outside of exercise, and shorts are only common on tourists and young people. Bikinis are totally out of the question, partly because there's no beach here. 

Yoga pants are different that leggings as they are made to be worn as pants, although I don't see them here.

I don't know why it bothers people so much, but it does cause people to make different snap judgments about other people. You might not care, but it does cause you to get treated differently sometimes.
