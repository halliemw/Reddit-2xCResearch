IIRC /r/wtf didn't really "opt out" the admins just introduced a mod rule ( i think limiting the number of defaults a user can mod) None of its mods wanted to step down, so it was removed from the defaults. 

they didn't actually say "remove us", they just didn't bother meeting the criteria to be kept in.
