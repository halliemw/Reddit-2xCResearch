> You are already on antidepressants so it is clear that you do not have full control over your brain.

Implying that anyone has full control over their brain? No one can control their brain, whatever that even means. If you feel sad one day, are you saying you can just will yourself into a different mood at all times, regardless of the circumstances? Depression doesn't mean you don't know what you want in life anymore than anyone else. I'm honestly dumbfounded you think of mental illness like that. The ignorance is astounding, truly. I'm slightly sorry for my tone but this is really offensive.
