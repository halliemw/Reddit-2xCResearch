I generally agree with /u/CoomassieBlue  A lot of men are not all that good at nuance or subtlety.  As a woman, you may think that your body language is screaming not interested, but the guy may be reading it entirely differently.  The best way is to come out and say it in plain english.  Be firm but kind, and don't leave any kind of loopholes, circumstances, or possibilities.

For example:

Man:  "Hey, I know we've been friends for years, would you like to go on a date?  Like, a date date?"

Woman: "I can't, you know I'm already dating whatshisface."

No matter how many times the above happens, the guy will think, "it's not that she's uninterested, she's just taken right now... I can wait."

Instead, try this:

Man:  "Hey, I know we've been friends for years, would you like to go on a date?  Like, a date date?"

Woman: "I'm sorry, but I don't feel that way about you.  I value your friendship, but I'm not interested in anything sexual between us."

In the above I specifically chose the word "sexual" instead of "romantic".  I did this because using the "romantic" euphemism still leaves the door open for fuck buddy status, and that could be the guy's next go to.
