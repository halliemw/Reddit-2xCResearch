It's obvious it feels bad when this person makes you feel unwanted. Have you ever tried talking to her about it in a calm way (either in the past or recently)? Or isn't she really open to such a conversation? If it's the latter I definitly wouldn't take this personally, then I'd say it's just a personalitytrait, a way she behaves to a number of people. Not much you can do about that, I just hope it hasn't affected your relationship with you father too much. Ever talked to him about it?

I definitly take communication seriously and me and my husband really try to keep on repeating every now and then that the kids can say anything without us getting mad or betraying their trust or anything (and we follow through of course, words and deeds...). And I really feel that this is helping a lot.

I never heard of spy alley before! It seems like fun! :) Once you know the rules, is there a lot of reading involved, or is that quite ok? Because I don't think they have it in our mother tongue, but if there's minimal reading, we can buy it in English and translate everything for the kids. 

Thanks for the suggestion and for sharing your story!
