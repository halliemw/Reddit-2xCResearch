Ick!! It's great that you at least now know what type of person he is, but yeah it sucks to find something like this out about someone. I've had that same experience with a friend who I knew in real life. After we both started using facebook I was shocked to see what kind of views he had.

>I feel like I'm never going to find anyone who measures up to my ex. 

I'm so sorry, that's an awful way to feel. :( Maybe you need some time where you only focus on and take care of yourself. Spoil yourself with good experiences you definitely deserve that.
