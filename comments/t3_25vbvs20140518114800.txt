Former bridal consultant here! Did you purchase this off the rack? Or just order the dress through a salon? Of you only ordered it, chances are the salon will let you out that money towards another gown. 

If you bought it off the rack and really no longer like the dress, you can call and beg the salon to let you exchange it. Offer a restocking fee, perhaps? If it's only been a couple days, they should be accommodating. They want happy customers.
