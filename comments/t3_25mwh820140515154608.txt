I JUST got catcalled from a car today, and I'm still sorta shaken. It's weird - I read lots of feminist blogs, I worked on a rape crisis hotline, I've put lots of thought into what I'll say to street harassers. And every time it happens, I freeze up and can't respond. It was even worse when the guy was driving past me on the street.

I was standing on the corner waiting for a crosswalk, and a douche in a suburban pulls up and rolls the window down. He yells something, but I have headphones in, so I take one out and he yells, "Wanna get in here in the air conditioning?" and motions for me to get in the car. I was just so stunned, all I said was "...No?" Then he said it again, and now cars were honking because he was holding up traffic and I felt humiliated, and I just pointed down the road and shouted "MOVE". He drove off looking at me like I was a bitch.

I wasn't actually scared at the time - after all, it was a crowded area and traffic was thick. If he'd wanted to grab me, I could easily have run and he wouldn't have been able to maneuver the car back. But once he was gone, I just felt gross and exposed.
