This man is a bully who is trying to use whatever tricks he can to get his own way. You did the right thing by reporting it and it sounds like they took appropriate action, so the only person who is in the wrong here and is making themselves look bad is him.

He's obviously been told to sort his behaviour out so I would just ignore it, don't rise to it and don't get dragged into it any further. Your superiors will be keeping an eye on him and his further behaviour won't go unnoticed, by remaining professional and getting on with your job you will only make yourself look good while he looks like a dick.
