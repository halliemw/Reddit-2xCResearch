Really good question.
To be honest, I was really excited. I believe that I want to have children some day but I am so young still, so the very idea of having my own child is just baffling to me. During the whole donation process I continually thought about the fact that I was, in some sense, going to be a mother--a biological and genetic mother. This is something so incredible to me, and the fact that I would be giving another woman the chance of raising a child by, in a very general sense, giving her a part of myself...woah. Just woah.

One thing I did not mention in my post was an encounter that I had when I was at one of my blood draw/ultrasound appointments. The clinic is spatially divided in half: one side for donors and the other side for recipients. The only time that the patients on either side will meet is in the central lobby where the elevators are. After this particular appointment, I left the donor side of the clinic and was waiting in the lobby for the elevator, at which time, a young and beautiful couple existed the recipient side of the clinic and stood near me to wait for the elevator as well. Once we were in that 6-foot by 6-foot cube, I tried so hard not to stare at them. I could not help but think "Is this woman receiving my ova? Is she going to be the mother of my child?" In that moment, I wanted to know everything about them. We ended up walking to the same Starbucks outside of the building, and the entire time, I wished that I knew who they were. 
I signed a waiver at my final appointment stating that the child has the right to contact me when he/she turns eighteen. I hope that he/she does. I would like to know, I can't deny it.
