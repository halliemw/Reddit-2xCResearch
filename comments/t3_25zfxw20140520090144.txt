I'm not a mother, but I think the way my mom handled it was good. My mom and I (and school friends and I) had casually talked about periods and I never had a serious sit down with my mom about it. That was only for sex talk haha. I got my period when I was 11 or 12 and when it happened, I was ready. I wouldn't worry too much about it. The only thing I wish my mom would have done was talk to me about tampons a few years later, because she only ever bought me pads, and eventually when I was 16 I just started buying tampons on my own. Although the first time I used them, I was a little scared about it haha.
