> Describing the killings as "misogynist extremism" implies that the misogyny was the root cause of the killings. 

One could interpret it that way, but I wouldn't, because it would be far too simplistic to claim that there was a single root cause. Human actions have complex causes. I would rather give the author the benefit of the doubt.

When Penny writes "The ideology behind these attacks - and there is ideology - is simple" I think she's saying that ideology was part of the cause, not the whole cause. And I think she's right that the killer's expressed belief system is pretty crude.
