So for the people slamming the boyfriend, saying he is being manipulative, abusive, or emotionally threatening... what would you rather him do?  If he unexpectedly finds himself being deeply uncomfortable with the looming abortion, should he keep his mouth shut and stay with someone who he is no longer comfortable with?  Stay with her and then break up with her as soon as it is done?  It is a shitty situation because they find themselves fundamentally disagreeing on an issue that few relationships would survive.  I don't think there is a right answer here.
