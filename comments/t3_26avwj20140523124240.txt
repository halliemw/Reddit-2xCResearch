I'm so sorry that you're having such bad cervical pain!  :(

Don't stress too much over the HPV.  I'm not saying it's nothing, but it's not usually a big deal.  I've been through about the worst of it that you happen, and it was a pain but not a serious health concern.

Years ago I tested positive for HPV.  I also had an abnormal PAP.  Because of the PAP they did a biopsy and found per-cancerous cells on my cervix.   I had a out-patient surgical procedure to have them removed.  I took one day off work.  It was inconvenient and no fun, but I didn't have any complications.  The worst part was that I had to have a PAP every 3 months during the following year.  :(

After that I tested negative for HPV for 5 years.  Recently I tested positive again, but my PAP was normal.  The doc had me come back after 6 months and it had all resolved (normal PAP and negative for HPV).  

I didn't have any complications from the surgery and I didn't have cervical pain (other than during the biopsy).  I've had a few friends go through this and none of them have talked about cervical pain either.  Obviously this is anecdotal, but I think it's likely there is something else going on.  I suggest looking at all possible causes, and just following your doctors suggestions regarding the HPV.
