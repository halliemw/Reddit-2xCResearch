I definitely understand not wanting to play that game. That's why if I'm positive I'll likely opt for removal. It's so crazy to think about too though. So much if my identity and self image is tired to my breasts, which I hadn't really realized until I started seriously considering the what-ifs. 

 I've figured I was positive for 13 years, since my mom died. I'll be very surprised if I am not positive. And as I've said elsewhere if I don't do it quickly I likely won't be able to afford it for quite some time.  It's weird to go from keeping it on a side burner in my mind to having it be on my mind almost constantly.
