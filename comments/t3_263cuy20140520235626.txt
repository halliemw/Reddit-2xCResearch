Hey, sorry you're in the same boat. This is basically it. 

I have a pretty busy schedule and am around people all the time. I'm just not that close to anyone anymore. My best friend from high school moved across the country, and the rest I'm not as close to as I once was for other reasons.

What I really want are friends that I can call up to and invite to lunch, come over and just talk or watch movies, or go out with on the weekends. But I starting with a hobby or interest is a good idea. You have to start somewhere.
