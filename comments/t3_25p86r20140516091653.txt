I'm with you - OP didn't do anything wrong, but she could've definitely come off as a buzzkill if she's operating with a group of people who are that comfortable with each other.

Nothing in the post sounds like a violation to me except for the being in her bedroom part, and as I said in another comment, my friends and I had definitely been close enough where if this happened, it wouldn't be a big deal.  Hell we even talked about moving people's beds outside while they were sleeping off their drunkenness - and we're all big kids here, you make them put the bed back and laugh at the surprise of waking up to a raccoon nibbling on your vomit-stained blanket.
