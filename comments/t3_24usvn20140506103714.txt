It started out that he never ever saw them. So when they did all got together I thought "well I see him all the time, he should have fun without me" but now he will them on average twice a week, once they will stay over and sleep in his bed, the girl getting the pride place next to him, the others at the end of the bed/on the floor. And then also meals out, which he can't afford. 

I tried added a couple of them on Facebook and they messaged my boyf like "poopybum just added me on facebook?" he reacted like "... And?" as if they all talk about me and I'm not aloud to have them on Facebook.. Weird.
