This is like something out of the 70s.  No male admin in an office that large, and makeup artists to help the girls look pretty? Really? I swear sometimes it's like we're moving backwards. And this office sounds like it's managed to create a situation where either gender could lawyer up for a discrimination claim.  I mean - 1000 person office and not one male admin? Geez.
