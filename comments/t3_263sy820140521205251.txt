> Beyond those initial effects from the first few encounters, I don't experience any further bonding or emotional changes the more sex I have with someone. If that's even really a thing. I would assume even for couples it's activities outside of sex that do that, generally?

Not necessarily. As you yourself noted, this "intimate" act exposes a side that people don't usually get to see. Since perceptions vary, people experience it differently. In your arrangement(s), as time progressed and you continued on with the act, you experienced little to no physiological/psychological changes while some of your partner(s) felt otherwise, even though they harbored the same expectations as you in the beginning.
