Second year PhD student here. 

One of the hardest things I've experienced is seeing friends that are my age be able to buy a house, have a salary, and have extra spending money for vacations and fun things, but yet I still feel like a college age kid who is broke and stuck doing homework. It gets to me when I spend my entire weekend on homework, and never feel like I get a break. Also, I hate that despite working 30+ hours, going to class, researching, and doing homework, people seem to think I am lucky because I am "still in college". 

I just have to remind myself that in four to five years, I'll be a part of a group that only makes up around 1% of the USA population.
