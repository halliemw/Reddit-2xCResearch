I know my experience is likely totally not what you're looking for but I'll share anyway, if only to give you an idea of the complete opposite of an 'astronomically priced' wedding.

All told I think we spent around $700 on both the wedding and our mini-moon..

Our wedding took place in the living room of a local wedding officiant, and we had a total of 4 guests. Neither me or my husband are terribly frilly people and we're also pretty private, so we didn't want anything huge.

Afterwards, being that my husband married a Canadian.. we went for Wedding Poutine (LOL) 

I also live right next to Niagara Falls, so we bought a weekend groupon deal which came with a bunch of vouchers for local restaurants and some money at the casino (where we walked away with $40 extra dollars) 

For us, this was perfect, romantic and amazing :) We had a blast! 

And now, when we have to deal with the immigration paperwork (he's coming to Canada) and I have to deal with paying the mortgage on the new house we're buying I don't have to regret blowing tons of money on the wedding.

It's probably not for everybody, but if you really do want to save some bucks my best advice would be to relax your standards and don't worry so much about having the PERFECT wedding by wedding magazine standards, and think of inexpensive and memorable things that you and your fiance enjoy.
