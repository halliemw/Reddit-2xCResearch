Did you want to answer any of the questions?  I think my comment is hidden now.

Do you feel like someone...anyone...is in a position to tell an entire group of people that they should read something?  if so what do you think the qualifications of that position should be?

Do you think its a little bit bigoted to assume that some group based solely on their skin color or gender that they do not already know something or are aware of a particular concept and thus need it explained to them?
