Ladies, gents, people and bots, why do we downvote this guy? His soul is obviously hurting, and all the comment replies are supportive, so where's this disconnect? He's got your sympathy, but nobody wants to see his whining? Maybe we can take a page from their book -- oh wait, it's ours -- and let the downtrodden speak.
