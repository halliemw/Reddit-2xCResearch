To me this is close to the douchebags who look me up and down while I'm walking in their direction, while I'm obviously avoiding eye contact, and say 'hi'. If I respond they usually say something like 'you're hot' or 'you should smile more', and if I don't they call me a bitch or talk shit about me as I pass by. I am not some device through which to prove your testosterone levels to your friends. All I want to do is continue to enjoy my walk and my day.

One day I was walking down the street under my umbrella (it was raining). This old guy literally stopped as I passed by, lifted up my umbrella, and said 'Hello, you should smile at people more'. I was so surprised that all I could do was give him a look, shove up my umbrella and keep walking.
