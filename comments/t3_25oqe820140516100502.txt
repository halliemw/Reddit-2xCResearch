I didn't get raped but my brother and I were molested by a neighbor at a similar age. My family believed us but the court did not, even though the guy had a prior history of sexual assault on minors in other states. My brother and I testified (which is a repressed memory for both us) at court but it was dismissed and the neighbor moved away, probably to strike again.

I can't imagine getting rejected by your family for being a victim of sexual abuse. My condolences.
