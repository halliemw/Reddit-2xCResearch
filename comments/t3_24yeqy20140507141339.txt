Hostility from the students is a valid concern, and that's why my Mom wouldn't want me teaching older kids in a rough area. 

On the other hand, OP says "The school is one of the better schools in the city and not very dangerous." However, there were hostile kids in my public school district (in a midsized town). If the suburbs aren't rich, OP might still face student hostility.

Perhaps since you were teacher you could give OP advice on how to gauge administrative supportiveness?
