Allyship is SO important. I know you were asking specifically about this forum but I really think it's important for anyone in a privileged position to be an advocate for less privileged people. For instance I am a white person and if another white person says something to me that sounds racist I will question them about it. A great strategy for this is to just ask, "What do you mean by that?" or act like you don't understand the stereotype or language they are using. This way they figure out what was wrong with what they said and will be embarrassed and hopefully rethink it. Unfortunately one of the main parts of being a member of a disadvantaged group is your voice carries less weight. Therefore it can be really valuable if those of us who are not in those groups help to work against those -isms with the people we associate with. I encourage you to question people you encounter in real life and on the internet when they say something that sounds sexist or misogynistic because it carries less weight when a woman does so, since we are the ones being affected and have a personal stake in it. I suspect that the majority of people on Reddit do support equality for women and people of color etc. but you wouldn't know it from the comments that get upvoted. If you are already doing this then kudos to you! :)
