But in the case they are talking about with the BC, it's just that some doctors don't want to do it. They aren't up on the progress(do doctors even have to go back and take special class to learn what new things have come out?) There's a difference in the extreme you are talking about and the actual subject, finding a doctor that will do it because they are perfectly within their rights to get that BC. It's the same kind of thing as the pharmacies that are crazy bible thumpers and don't want to give plan B, do you just say whelp I guess that's it, or do you find a doctor that WILL give it to you, because it's your legal right to have it?
