I would suggest One Tree Hill, Gilmore Girls, The West Wing and Buffy the Vampire Slayer!

I most recently finished One Tree Hill - I refused to watch it in high school on principle alone. I thought it was just another "dumb teenage drama" but after I watched the entire series at the age of 22 I realized why it was so popular, it really did hit home with me about the lifestyle of high school and the entire culture of the episode really reminded me of how difficult high school could be.

Gilmore Girls is just a great feel good show - it also hits on real life story lines such as a difficult family, but it reminds you of how bittersweet life is. The songs are awesome in the show and you will seriously see so many actors that you never realized acted on the show!

The West Wing is just a must see in my opinion. I love this show - it is my favoritest show ever. If you have a taste for politics at all I would highly recommend it. 

Buff the Vampire Slayer - my middle school years show of choice. I think I am a bigger and better person because of this show!
