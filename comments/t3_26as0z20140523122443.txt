Most people get bitten twice before they learn not to shake paws with a tiger.

It's not about refusing to make a mistake... its refusing to make the same mistake you've been "punished" for again and again.  If someone gets frustrated that it "wasn't done right" but doesn't show me the right way to do it, I'm done doing it.
