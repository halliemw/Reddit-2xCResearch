I understand, but saying that to your coworkers may make them take it more seriously. It sucks, but if I were in your situation and already meeting resistance from HR (I assume that's who you're working with) then I would assume that they weren't going to take my feelings of belittlement and disrespect seriously. Feeling unsafe? Yeah, they might respond to that.

It sucks, and it shouldn't have to be that way, and I don't really want to advise you to lie, but if HR is already questioning you and the harasser is thinking it's a joke...I dunno. I wish I had better advice!
