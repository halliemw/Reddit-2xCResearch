I'm about to turn 30, have been told that I'm "intimidatingly" tall, and very single. Sometimes it bothers me, but I realize I haven't met anyone that I've wanted to marry yet. I like to think that I'm getting to spend more time with myself: improving myself, having fun by myself, pursuing my own interests. So if or when I do meet someone, I will be the best, most fulfilled Me I can be. 

So I guess my advice is, enjoy this time with yourself to the fullest. I know it gets lonely (oh, how I know!), but if you cultivate a rich life, it'll be all the better to share with someone else later on (hopefully with someone who has cultivated their own rich existence). :)
