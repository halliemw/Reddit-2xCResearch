Honestly, you need to take a step back and evaluate if you trust him. If you have been together for almost two years---you have to just let go and know that he will stay faithful to you. If you don't, you are going to really mess yourself up mentally while he is away. 

Set up Skype dates, snapchat, etc., it is much easier to be in a LDR than it used to be in terms of contact with the person (I was pre-smart phone and that was rough).

The first month or so will be difficult---no lie. It will be hard not having that person there when that is what you are used to but just try and pick up a hobby in your spare time and go out with your friends more often. Your SO will miss you just as much as you miss him :)
