I am unsure of what your point is. Like you, I have no idea whatsoever about what to answer to someone who had one bad experience with a hairdresser. I can't relate to that. My solution is very simple: I don't answer anything. If I have nothing to contribute, I simply don't. If something doesn't interest me - because frankly I don't find that hairdresser story interesting - I simply don't click on it or I leave without a comment. That's easy.
