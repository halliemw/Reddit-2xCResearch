That's not how insurance works. Insurance isn't charged for a prescription like a credit card or something. The person who gets the insurance (in this case, her dad) pays the premium every month, and then the company fully covers things like pap smears, doctor well visits, vaccinations, STD checks, and birth control. It also covers a portion of sick care (80% is common), and the patient pays the rest (20%). So, the insurance coverage is already paid for. She has access to it, and she uses it to go to the doctor and everything. She can also use it for birth control, and it won't cost her parents anything extra. They're not charged for it. The problem is that she doesn't want them getting an explanation of benefits that says she picked up birth control at a pharmacy.
