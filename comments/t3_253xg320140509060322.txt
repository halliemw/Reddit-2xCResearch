1) Don't be worried about having to choose a 'woman' for a bridesmaid. I've been to plenty of weddings that have had male 'maids of honour' etc.

2) If you SO's mother is still alive and you don't want to have your own bridal party, ask her. It will mean THE EARTH to her to be up front at her sons (i presume!) wedding. If you truly don't want anyone else you know to be part of your bridal party, have her. It'd be a great way to earn some brownie points :)
