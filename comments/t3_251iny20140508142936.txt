I just want something cleared up. 
Are you upset about him talking/writing with other women, or that he most problably flirted with another woman. 
I can understand if you are upset, but it could just be that he has "friendzoned" her, and that she just has another way of showing feelings of friendship on the social media. hell she could even be lesbian and joking about "man crush monday".
