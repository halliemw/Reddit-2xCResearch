Yes, I was about 100lbs overweight, all gained in a short amount of time since I'd gone from being very active to being housebound.  

I tried all sorts of diets before and I always focused on the number of calories, the number on the scale etc. and I never stuck to it. Then I learned about mindful eating. I do count calories in that I try not to exceed a certain amount but it is not the end of the world if I do, I just try to balance it out the next day or through out the week.  

The walking does help! I've even started jogging. When I used to do the classes or the DVDs I found them so boring I would make excuses not to do them but now I find myself really looking forward to getting out and about! Some days I can walk 10 miles other days I do only 1, as long as I get out and about. On days I can't walk for whatever reason I have a really fun dance DVD that I do and it leaves me feeling pretty good about myself afterwards. :) Even 15 minutes is better than nothing, just doing something makes me feel fab!
