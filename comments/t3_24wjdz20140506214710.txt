>writing doesn't become yelling

Exactly, and it helps me stay on target when he tries to pull something out that bothers him to (intentionally/unintentionally) distract me. And I don't get suckered by him making me feel guilty when I tell him I'm upset.

He actually refuses to do anything more involved (and honestly I'm surprised he even responded) over email. I will send him long emails or even short ones and he just straight up ignores them, not even the one-sentence response you saw above. Sometimes I feel like he totally controls communication in this relationship and I have to follow a super weird set of rules just to be able to let him know I'm upset about something, and then that snowballs into me dropping the subject because he looks so angry, or he will speak his anger and I end up feeling bad.

I am really considering moving on from this relationship. We're not married, but we both sort of made a pledge to stick it out and work through our problems at the beginning and I really like that about us. However, I just feel like no matter what I do I can't get what I want out of this relationship, you know?

Thank you a ton for your comment.
