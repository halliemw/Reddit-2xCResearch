Baby Foot is a peel for you feet that works well. You wear booties for an hour and about two weeks later your feet start to slough off skin. I sent my sister some as a gift. She has trouble with calluses on her heals that will crack and bleed in the summer. She said it was gross but after the dead skin peeled off her feet looked great.
