Do or don't do it based on your own values, morals and feelings on the issue. 

It's not "magical" in the sense that it changes you or anything. It's just an experience, a somewhat more intimate experience than others. 


My first time was a mess. Neither of us got tons out of it and it wasn't super romantic, but I loved the guy and I was glad it was with him. 


So if you want it to be with someone you love, then wait. Basically, whatever you decide, be true to yourself and make decisions based on what you want.
