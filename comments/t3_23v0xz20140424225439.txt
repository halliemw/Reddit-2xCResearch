While I like what /u/PoniesRBitchin said about practicing saying no etc. The one thing I disagree with is having somewhere to be. I used to make excuses when people made me uncomfortable but you don't *need* to explain why you're saying no. You don't have to say no because you're on your way somewhere. Practice saying no and just leaving it at that. It'll make you feel empowered. You never owe anyone an explanation when they ask why you won't do something for them (excluding relationship dynamics where communication should be more detailed) but with strangers and family and friends who put you in certain positions just say no or no thank you. No explanation needed :)
