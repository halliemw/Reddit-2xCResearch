Thanks a ton for that reply, I honestly need some people to tell me I'm not crazy by choosing to go to Germany for that. I just think it's a very serious matter when it's about the reproductive organs. 

I don't think the docs even kept those ultrasound scans for themselves.. which is already weird. But I'll try to get other info or anything I can get to bring it. 

Also about your story, it sounds very painful and it also worries me about how much is only visible with ultrasound. How did your situation end? Were they able to save the ovary?
