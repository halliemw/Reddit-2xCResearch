I saw this and it depressed me immensely.  On mentioning it to other people reactions varied from agreement that it was awful to people (both genders) saying that her comedy includes quite a bit of stuff about other women's appearance.  Now I don't know enough about her schtick to agree or not.  If true does this make her a hypocrite?     
For clarity I was pretty appalled by her story and wish this kind of crap would stop.
