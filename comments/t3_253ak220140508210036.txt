Thank you so much for understanding the extent of this. This is a real, destructive issue, and people just brush it off. It helps that you simply believe me.

You know sometimes you start getting gaslighted because there's something that bothers you but everyone says you're overreacting?

Your reassurance helps me stay grounded in my view of the situation. I shouldn't ever doubt how messed up it is.
