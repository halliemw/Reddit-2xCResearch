This is what I found about Alberta. [When you call the police, they decide whether to charge](http://www.pringlelaw.ca/practices/4-domestic-violence) the accused. If you live in Edmonton and the police decide not to charge them [you may be able to charge them](http://www.slsedmonton.com/family/domestic-abuse/) by going to the provincial court.
