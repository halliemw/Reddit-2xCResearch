>It's everyone's bullshit superstitious judgment that makes this such a weighty decision for some people. 

Yes, god yes.  Everyone is different, but I get so tired of hearing, "it wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one." That's just feeding into the hands of the anti-choice assholes. 

I've had 3 (I'm 48 years old). Not once was it "not an easy decision."  

Never regretted them, never looked back, I did what I needed to do and moved on with my life. I never even think about them until a conversation like this comes up. Why should I? I don't think about my  missing gallbladder or the half dozen kidney stones I've passed in my life. You're exactly right; it's a clump of cells.

As long as women sit around wringing their hands and wistfully saying, "it wasn't an easy decision and I think about it often..."  we'll NEVER get the anti-choicers to go away. They see that bit of hesitation and self-doubt as an opportunity to jam their wedge in and start working away at our confidence in making our own choices.
