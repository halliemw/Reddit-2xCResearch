See, I realize that you see it only as a political view. But it is much more than that to me. It is as important of a deal breaker as having children. I don't see it as just some well informed ideas on social change. It is part if my identity, why I get up in the morning, why I do every single action.

I've never begun a relationship with someone who wasn't Christian. If my husband had told me he was atheist when we first met, I would have called it off before both of us got too deep into the relationship. It is similar to breaking it off if you find out your significant other hates something you find your identity in. You are a fitness trainer and they are a couch potato. Your aspiration is to be a painter and they think art programs should be cut from schools because it isn't important. These are perfectly fine reasons to end a relationship. Why is religion not one?

If he told me now that he was losing his faith, that would be a different story. We would obviously try to work it out. I have married him and started a family. It would hurt, but we would make it work. They have love, but their commitment is lacking. My point is that they have never matched in this issue and have avoided figuring out if it is a deal breaker.
