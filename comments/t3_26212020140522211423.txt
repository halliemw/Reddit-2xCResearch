Unfortunately, due to the nature and variety of our posts here on /r/TwoXChromosomes, we cannot limit our moderation as much as subreddits with a more narrow focus such as creepyPMs or AskHistorians.  We are looking at different ways to tighten and streamline our moderation policies.  The [Support] tag and a few other changes came out of community suggestions,  so if you have further suggestions, please share them.  We're happy to hear them.

We have also added 3 new mods since defaulting, and intend to continue expanding the mod team again very soon.
