I think the problem is they don't understand what harassment is. A non-malicious act that happens to hurt someones feelings isn't harassment. If, however, the delivery person requested they be fully clothed for future deliveries because it makes them uncomfortable, and then they do it the next time that person delivers. I believe that could be considered harassment, even if it's legal to be topless. At the very least, the driver could refuse future deliveries to that address.
