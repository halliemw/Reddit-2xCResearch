I know she's the villain, but Azula from avatar the last airbender is an amazing example of a strong female character. She's terrifying and her powers and reasons for acting the way she does has nothing to do with the fact that she's a female and I love that. 

Many female characters may seem strong on the surface, but all their powers and personality traits are based on the fact that they're a girl, rather than true character development, personality, and a interesting backstory. 

She also dresses in a respectable manner that is logical for what she is doing at the time. Many female characters are very sexualized and Azula is not.
