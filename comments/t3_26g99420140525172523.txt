>And actually, he did not even make an Avance

Professing feelings is an advance, giving a gift that's also an advance, insisting upon giving her a ride home after everything that transpired that day would be considered an advance.

If this man waited until the last day to do this, it's because he was well aware of how inappropriate and unprofessional it would be to act on feelings for a woman that's old enough to be his granddaughter. Not to mention OP has a boyfriend and if she was working there that long that probably came up at some point.
