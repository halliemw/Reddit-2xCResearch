Thank you for responding. I am definitely going to talk to my doctor. It seems like the pain level is not typical. I actually experienced months long periods after both Paragard insertions and longer periods in general, so I know I can live with that scenario. 

Unfortunately, if this IUD is not for me, I may just forgo BC. I am not terribly sexually active currently and I've just had terrible experiences with higher levels of hormones. Oh well.
