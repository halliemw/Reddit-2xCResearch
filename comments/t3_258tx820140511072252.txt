I'm disappointed that Lois McMaster Bujold isn't on that list. I suspect that's because her books are actually funny, not super-serious, but I view that as a bonus. Or maybe it's because she's not writing about feminist issues? Or because the main character she writes about is male? But she has plenty of well-developed, complex, strong female characters as well.

I mean, I know this is only a list of 10 books. But I read a lot of sci-fi, and I view Lois McMaster Bujold as one of the most talented sci-fi authors around, male OR female.
