Yes, its pretty sad that this is the go of it for a whole lot of women.

I am continuously surprised by how many men have no idea that most women cant orgasm through vaginal sex (that sentence was really poorly structured). But, I guess I have kinda shot myself in the foot by just faking it as a rule. 

I guess its just easier sometimes, especially in a casual hookup. Easier than giving the whole lecture on incidence of female orgasm through intercourse, that is.
