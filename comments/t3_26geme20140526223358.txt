Thank you so much. I sometimes also feel like I don't have a lot of outlets for understanding and expression; reddit serves as one of those places for me as well. 

I really appreciate your thoughtful comment. 

I have been frequenting r/loseit and I will definitely check out r/fitness too. I've been researching the Atkins program and have been working on phase 1 for the last few days. Not perfect at it yet, but am definitely feeling good having given up starch and bread! Thanks again.
