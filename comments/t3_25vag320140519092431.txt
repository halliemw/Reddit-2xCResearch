Any guy who says that is a dumb sexist, and this is coming from a guy who used to be one of those dumb sexists. Don't even try to reason with them, they're mentally children and some of them will grow out of it when their time comes. Don't be afraid to call a spade a spade.

edit: I know it sucks. I need to listen to my own words and stop trying to talk to sexist women myself.
