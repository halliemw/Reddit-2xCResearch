I getcha. And yeah, people are mammals. We're all covered in hair, it just varies in thickness, colour, length, and so on. I think there will always be people who are surprised simply because they aren't exposed to a given texture/look. Where I live, some people go years before seeing someone of another race. 

Nipple variety is another thing that can surprise. They're still nipples, obviously, but the sheer diversity is amazing (especially since most people see porn nipples/their own before "real" ones/others')
