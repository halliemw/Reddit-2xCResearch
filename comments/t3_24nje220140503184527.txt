I hit full sized and started my period when I was ten, so puberty was probably underway by eight (nine at the latest).  Usually body hair precedes the scary things like periods (because *sudden blood* is scary no matter how well prepared you are), so there should be fair warning on that front.  

I'll agree with /u/OnBehalfOfTheState where she says that someone might mention it to the pediatrician - though to be fair I imagine it's something they look for in regular checkups.  

I was a voracious reader as a child and had several books aimed at the YA audience that explained what was happening/going to happen.  I'd say I started reading them around probably 3rd grade (age 8).  If she likes to read, it might be worth picking up some such literature.  

My mother was always available to answer questions.  She is a nurse practitioner, which I'm sure, to some extent, colored how she navigated the topic - her coverage was always factual and compassionate.
