Yeah, but he hasn't touched them since maybe a year and a half ago when I told him if it happened again I would call CPS. Of course he and my mom denied any abuse and said I "only ever got spanked twice and never out of anger." Which is complete bullshit. I kept arguing with them and my dad finally said he did it out of anger sometimes but "always had our best interests in mind."
