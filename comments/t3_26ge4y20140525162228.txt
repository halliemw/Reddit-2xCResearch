I think you're being smart and strong and good to yourself by breaking up with him. Your intuition *knows*.  You don't trust him, and you find it hard to communicate with him - yep, time to go.  And here's the thing, you're actually being good to him, too, by breaking up. So he can find someone with whom he's more compatible

Now, here's where my opinion may be unpopular. I say you don't even owe him a deep explanation. You can get out of it with a simple, "Bob, I'm sorry. You're a good man, but I'm just not feeling it. I'm breaking things off, and I wish you the best in finding someone who treasures you. You're a good man."  If he pushes it, you can just keep repeating, "I'm just not feeling a connection." or "You're just not the right one for me."

The reason I suggest this kind of break up is because it gets the job done with a minimum of fuss. Getting into detail *can* become a big drama, and a negotiation. So this is a way to avoid that.

However, you may want to have a full-reveal discussion with him, for various reasons (for example, to give him the chance to change, or because he conveys that knowing the reasons will help him in the future with his next gf), so that is up to you.

Good luck and keep us posted.
