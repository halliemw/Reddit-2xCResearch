No, I know that. It's just hard knowing that I might have caused my dad to get even more angry, therefore getting more aggressive than normal towards my mom. I know it's not rational, but it's hard not to feel like *I'm* the one ruining everything sometimes, especially when my whole family is against me, and they're likely convincing everyone else that I'm a spoiled brat who over-reacted during a fight with my dad.
