There's a difference between using the partner line when you would be interested if you were not already in a relationship and using the line in the way the author is talking about.

The author is talking about men who do not respect a simple no. Who for whatever reason (implied ownership, competition, etc) ignore a 'not interested' and keep pushing on. Now if the person hits on you respectfully and you would be interested were it not for your relationship, then sure, mention your relationship. That way you telegraph 'i would be interested in other circumstances'.

But it's really just not what the author is talking about.
