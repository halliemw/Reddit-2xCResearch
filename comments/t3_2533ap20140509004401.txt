Safe means: I didn't think I would have to deal with this shit from this person/in this setting.

As I and others have said and restated, it was most likely a brain fart. Here it is again: it was probably a brain fart and she shouldn't think much of it unless it continues. ONE MORE TIME! Brain. Fart. *pffffffffffffffft*. If you need me to restate that yet again let me know and I'll be happy to oblige.

Your experience of having women tell you that in the office isn't like having the constant societal pressure to be sexually attractive at all times. As a woman with short hair I can confirm that it is constant, it comes from all sides, it is annoying, and I'm sorry that you don't agree with that but that's just the way that it is. If you don't get offended by it then yourself that's swell, I'm not saying you should, but if you don't want to hear women venting about common experiences that you can't relate to then you probably shouldn't be on a women's sub that has been designed for that purpose.
