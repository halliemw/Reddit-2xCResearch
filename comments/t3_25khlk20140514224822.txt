I commented knowing that it would probably invoke this type of reaction, though it was not my intention to. I see it far too often that each gender complains about something "sexist" happening that happens between both sexes. Hypocrisy is the worst enemy of progress, and so is constantly trying to play the victim with something that happens to everyone. With this problem, and many in particular, I think we need to address it as humans and not male/female. It's just a social flaw, not an attack on a certain gender, and I wanted to point that out before the people who generalize events like this went crazy with it. I never meant any disrespect, I just figured that I would share an alternative view on the situation at hand.
