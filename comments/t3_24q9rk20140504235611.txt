I think that maybe this idea of "ownership" comes from the idea that generally men approach women first or are expected to make the first move. So the idea behind apologizing to the man is like saying "sorry I didn't know you got there first." This is, of course, a ridiculous concept but maybe that's just how some people see it.( I feel like this doesn't make as much sense as I want it to.)
