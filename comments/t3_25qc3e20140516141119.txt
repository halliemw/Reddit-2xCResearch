Same problem here.  I'll usually unbutton the top couple of buttons and put on a nice high-neck camisole under the shirt.  That plus a necklace generally looks pretty smart--plus the right camisole can help keep the boobs on lock down a little if you end up rushing around/moving quickly. Hopefully that helps a little!
