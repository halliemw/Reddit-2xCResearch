Birth control does not affect who you are attracted to. While it may alter your moods slightly, or change the way you feel around your period, it won't cause you to lose attraction for someone. 

Additionally, if you are in a supportive and communicative relationship, you should be able to discuss these things with your boyfriend so he will be open to helping you adapt to any changes you may experience. You may have to try multiple pills before you find the hormone level/combo that works for you. 

Finally, I have never ever heard of bc making women's breasts smaller or saggy, that's kind of ridiculous to be honest. Please do some research into reputable sources and talk to your doctor. 

There is so much misinformation surrounding contraceptives out there, it makes me sad that so many women are afraid of them :/
