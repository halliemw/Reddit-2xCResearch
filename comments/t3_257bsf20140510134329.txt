Oh brother.  She doesn't have to be having sex, but she wants to have it, chose to have it, and now wants to use a post-sex contraceptive so she doesn't get pregnant when she's 17.  I don't see how anyone's opinions on whether or not that's responsible are going to help her make the choices she wants to that have no impact on other people's lives.  

That's why OP made this post: to show that, to their surprise, there clearly still are these serious stigmas surrounding the use of contraceptives.  If OP's friend didn't have someone to help her get Plan B, would she have bought it at all, given the shame thrown on people buying it?
