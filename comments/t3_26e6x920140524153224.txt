I rather him be honest about his feelings so that I may act accordingly. If a guy has feelings for me, I will detach slowly and let it pass, and makr sure none of my actions are misread as reciprocation.

I feel a lot of sadness at the prospect of having to hang out with a guarded attitude. It's just not me at all!
