I didn't want to take his number, but he walked away before I could respond. Since I see him on a regular basis because he comes in a few times a week, I didn't want him to get the idea that I was blowing him off because I thought he was a creep or something, which would potentially make things more awkward (this dude seemed really depressed and unhappy with life and I didn't want to perpetuate that). So I texted him to ensure him that it wasn't anything that *he* did, but rather my unavailability.

I commend you for being able to treat those situations with a light heart. I am really trying to work on that myself. I guess it's just happened so much since I got this job that I've been having a hard time emotionally rehabilitating myself after really uncomfortable situations like that come up so often. I'm sure I'll eventually get used to it.
