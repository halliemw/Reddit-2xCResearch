It honestly just felt like you were mocking me? Yes, it is a default subreddit. So? I know it was a place where there were others who have been through similar situations and I felt like it was the right place to actually talk about my experience. If it was not for it being a default sub I wouldn't have came across every one else's stories. So I found solace in it. Is that wrong? 
I am not really sure what you were getting at in your first comment. Hence why I was a little dismissive and taken aback.
