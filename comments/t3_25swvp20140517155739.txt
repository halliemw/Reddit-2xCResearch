So, because some people make errors in critical thinking, we should all accept them?  Good clothes do not a good lawyer make - if only that were true, it would be easy to pick out good lawyers.

People judge underweight people as sickly or overly controlling - so it's impractical to change that?  People make *huge* judgments (and always have) based on skin color, so it's impractical to change that?

Oh.  Saw your handle.  Fits with your perspective.  Personally, the only people I look down on are those that demonstrate judgmentalism and lack of intelligence.
