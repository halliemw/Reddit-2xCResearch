Can I suggest you stop in to [r/secondary_survivors](http://www.reddit.com/r/secondary_survivors)?  It's a sub specifically for people in relationships with abuse survivors.  You might get some informed opinion there.  

Also, you might find some useful resources [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/jessiesparents/comments/1w65w4/resources_and_useful_links).

Keep being sensitive and paying attention to her cues.  You'll find your way together.
