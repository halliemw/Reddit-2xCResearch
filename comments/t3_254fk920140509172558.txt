It doesn't really work like that, but exercising through pregnancy is good for you and the baby and can certainly help both of you stay healthy. It can also help your body recover, although many different factors are involved.

I was very active my entire pregnancy, recovered extremely quickly and also quickly regained the body I'd had pre-pregnancy.
