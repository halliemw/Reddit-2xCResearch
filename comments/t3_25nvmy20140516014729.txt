This is the most helpful thing I've read all day. I appreciate your honesty along with what you and other police officers do and what your positions stand for. I also respect the fact that you do get tons of reports filed for many things, some of which may or may not be crimes. I apologize for not knowing exactly whether the questions asked of my friend were the right kind, but I appreciate you being a human being about it and explaining everything without making me feel totally ignorant :) ...Which I guess I kind of am in this case because I'd never actually researched it in anticipation of living it. but, in any case, so very many thanks.
