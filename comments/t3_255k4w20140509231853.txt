They do! They stretch really nicely. I'm 5'1", 121lbs (ish, it goes up and down), and short waisted with big boobs and wide hips, and they look fantastic on me. Give it a try - especially since they have a sale on this weekend.

(I am not a shill, I promise, I just love their shirts. I've ordered from a lot of online stores, and theirs are my favourites)
