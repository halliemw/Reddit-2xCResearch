I'm a mod in another subreddit that was asked, and the admins asked the mods of the subreddit if they wanted their subreddit to be a new default whilst instructing us to keep quiet about it.

This has not been forced by the admins, this was a choice made by the mods here. All it takes is for them to uncheck an option in the subreddit settings and twox would be removed from the defaults.

I love this subreddit, but it does not warrant a spot on the default list for the same reason /r/atheism did not, the content is not generally universal. As another redditor said, some subreddits are best left to the people who seek them.
