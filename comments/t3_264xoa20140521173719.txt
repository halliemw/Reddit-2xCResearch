Do you have a link for that? 

I bought Plan B via Pharmacy Consultants (the company mentioned in the article) on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EIQUH5A/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) last month. It arrived in two days, and appears to be the genuine product. It looks exactly the same as the box I saw in CVS.

I also just searched the NARAL website, and can't find any mention of it being a scam...
