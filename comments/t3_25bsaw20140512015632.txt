I once read an analogy on Reddit that said it's like being in the room of a building that is on fire. You know that jumping will kill you so you tough it out in the smoke filled room with flames licking your feet. But at a certain point you realize you are suffocating and being burned alive and just can't take it anymore so you jump. You didn't want to jump. You didn't want to die. But the alternative was simply too painful. 

Edit: Apparently this is actually from a quote by David Foster Wallace. Many people have quoted it below if you want to read the whole thing!
