I've literally never heard a pro-lifer say abortion is unsafe irl. Just random snippets on /r/politics.

I've also never heard a pro-lifer say they thought they could prevent every abortion. They want to outlaw abortion but I think they recognize it can't be totally prevented any more than any other crime.

Both these myths are really part of the movement that I've seen from classmates.
