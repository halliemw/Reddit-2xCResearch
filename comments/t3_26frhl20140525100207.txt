Try turning that around.

"But...form fitting tshirts are distracting to girls."

Doesn't it sound odd?  You might even laugh if someone said that.  And the fact is, you honestly never would hear anyone say that.  And that is what tells you that there's something wrong here - some flaw in logic and reasoning.  And it cuts both ways.  It not only makes women responsible for men's thoughts, and the actions they may take (catcalling, unwanted sexual advances, rape) due to those thoughts, but it also takes away  any sense of responsibility for men.  It turns men into slobbering idiots completely incapable of controlling themselves.  Which, I am sure you will agree, is not true of men at all.

This type of thinking harms both men and women.
