First, you did everything you felt comfortable doing. If it had escalated I don't think you would be all "well ok time to die I guess." You said no to lunch and you wouldn't have gotten in a car with him and you wouldn't have given him your address no matter HOW awkward you felt because you are smart. Never forget how smart you are. 

Second, try not to assume people know where your boundaries are ("you'd think he'd know that approaching a lone woman in a lifeless parking lot is creepy"). He SHOULD know, sure, but maybe he is really bad at approaching women and this is the thing he does. 

Third, practice "outs" for if something like this happens again. "Hey, it was great talking but I really have to get to class" (even if you're not going to class). This kind of out is good if you want to keep things friendly (like if you don't want to mess up networking opportunities, etc.) In the case of this guy, with his insistent "Why?" line of questioning, it's ok to be more forceful. Do you really want this guy as a networking contact if he's this creepy? If you keep it super friendly with the "out" above, and ever see him again, he will continue to be creepy. So give it to him straight, doc. His "Why?" can be shot down with a curt "I don't think that's necessary. Give me your info and I'll look you up." Or "I really need to get going." Or "I'm busy." 

This advice is not all encompassing, I know, but I am also a lady who had super high social anxiety and trouble saying no to people who "seemed nice enough." I have since learned that speaking up doesn't make my networking world or social world smaller, just less creeptastic.
