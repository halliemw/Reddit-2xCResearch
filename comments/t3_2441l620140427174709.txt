The article is wondering why there's a 20% rise in arrests, that's why. Men had a 17% drop in arrests. So while, yes, they still represent a greater percentage of total arrests, the question the writer is attempting to address is not the entire situation, but one question. Journalism 101 - ask a question no one else is asking. This question came out of a crime data trends report, and perhaps the writer was personally intrigued by this piece of data. Who knows?

If you're curious about why men are arrested on DUI in those numbers, there are studies and data in addition to this one out there. Yes, driving drunk is a problem when it's anyone, but when writing an article, sometimes you must keep to a narrower scope to examine a question without making it so broad that you never get anywhere. 

Maybe I'm looking at this with a journalist's eye, but this is a reasonable examination of one question brought about through examination of data.

It's not touching on 'ladette culture or 'emotional problems'. I think you're misguiding your argument.
