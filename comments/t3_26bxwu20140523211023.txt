You are not overreacting. That sounds scary, and the feelings you had are natural and valid. I'm sorry that happened to you.

One time, I was in a shop and an older man grabbed my butt. I turned around, and he reacted oddly and winked at me. I shrugged it off, continued shopping, and went home. ALL afternoon, I was really pissy and couldn't figure out why. Finally my husband asks me what's up, and I just started sobbing about what happened, and I was pissed at myself for not reporting him to...SOMEONE! Police, the store, anywhere. It was gross and I just felt the need to cry it out for a bit. My husband was shocked because I told him about it and laughed it off, but clearly it bothered me. 

So moral of my story: reacting and crying and being scared after creepy things and scary, violent things happen are not just "overreactions." It's scary.
