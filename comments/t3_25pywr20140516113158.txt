"It ended up making a great deal of people upset, and a lot of young men ended up sending floods of emails and messages to me about their profound feelings of regret, empathy, surprise, warmth, and oddly, slight shock that they’d identified with a woman protagonist quite like they did. Some of them said it made them reassess their relationships. Women merely told me they cried (thankfully out of empathy), which is the thing I was most surprised about. If I played this game for the first time I think I would be so unsurprised at the protagonist’s troubles I’d probably feel sort of numb about it, but then, I guess I made it. But women were overwhelmingly saddened by the contents of it because apparently it articulates a problem that looks like it can’t be solved, which is unusual for the traditional videogame, which I am certain Sacrilege will never be classified as. **Frankly, I made a game that hurts people in just the right way, which is something I did partly by accident, and partly as an attempt at emotional terrorism.**"
