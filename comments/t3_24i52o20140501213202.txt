Call your doctor. Those are some severe symptoms, especially the neuropathic pain (which is what that burning in your fingers and toes is called) so you're going to want to talk to a pro. The mood swings and change in appetite are to be expected and are probably temporary, but that neuropathic pain could be something serious. I'm not saying that to scare you. I'm just saying that you need to talk to your doctor instead of asking the internet for help.
