This is coming, I think.  With Game of Thrones (as sexist as you might think it is, it features some strong female characters), or popular shows like Korra, I think there's more of an appetite for more interesting/diverse female leads.

Cause really, the same old male leads are getting boring.  Mixing it up with female characters would be nice.
