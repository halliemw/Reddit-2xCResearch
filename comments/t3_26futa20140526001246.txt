I might have a little bit of meaningful perspective on this. I'm a guy and while not officially diagnosed with Asperger's, am 95% sure I've got it (a vast majority of the symptoms fit me and it pretty well explains my life). Rodger apparently had Asperger's too, and at least from what he said about his life, I do believe that. He has a whole host of other crap though I can assure you, as not having been kissed til 22 is likely due to Asperger's (will explain further) and wanting to "make them pay" and actually killing people is completely different.

I've only seen the video and a couple things from his manifesto, but just from his video, a couple possibilities came to me:

- It really doesn't seem like he technically approached many girls or got to know many girls.

- I can imagine given the way he looks that he may have been flirted with and just never recognized it.

- He, like me, may have not had the greatest female role models when younger and may have felt like any sort of advances at all were "creepy" and you couldn't really tell a girl you were interested in her without more or less ruining her day. Seriously, I have a hard time giving a woman a compliment, because I feel like I'd be a creep for doing it. I know there's obviously a wrong creepy way of doing it, but could never shrug off the notion that any way is the wrong way. And yea, try going through life never telling a girl how pretty her eyes were or the like and see how far that gets you. He was 22 and never been kissed - I was almost 24 before I was, and it was even somewhat freak circumstances I could have never imagined. I'm 32 now and I'd say there's maybe 20-30% chance by now I may still have never been kissed with the way I was going.

The whole "pursuing someone" thing is next to impossible for someone with Asperger's. If someone's not pursuing you, you are probably not going on a date. You CAN work up the courage sometimes but it takes only one or two rejections to not be able to work up the courage for years.
