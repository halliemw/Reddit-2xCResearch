Their comment was removed also, but it seemed more of a light jab to me, calling someone a terrible person and disgusting over a light jab isn't welcome here. We do tend to have a bit of fun in our comments.

You appear to be taking more offense to the idea that you were assumed to be a woman which, I'm sorry, is something that will happen on this subreddit.

If you wish to discuss this further please feel free to message modmail, but either way in the future please just keep it civil.

thanks.
