I am obsessed with mail. I love writing and receiving letters and it's my go-to method of reaching out and saying, "Thinking of you, I love and miss you" to out-of-town friends and family. It's not often I get replies in kind, but I have one friend who moved away from my hometown in junior high, and we've been exchanging letters fairly regularly ever since. Feels so good.
