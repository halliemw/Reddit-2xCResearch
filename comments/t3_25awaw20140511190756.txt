I'm so sorry. That's awful. :( I'm just asking out of curiosity, and not because it would change anything, but were you able to get tested for roofies or other drugs afterward? It's one of those things that irrationally (?) scares me, especially since it can just look like drunkenness to anyone on the outside.
