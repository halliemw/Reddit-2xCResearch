Ear piercings aren't really a part of my culture (my parents are refugees) but I am one of very few (less than 5) family members that I know with pierced ears. My body doesn't take well to piercings apparently and I had to have them repierced so many times, up until I was 21 or something, now I've got 3 in one year and 2 in the other. In the end, I actually very rarely wear earrings at all!
