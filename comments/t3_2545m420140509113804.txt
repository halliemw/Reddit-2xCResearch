Mine has been irregular like this since I stopped birth control about a year and a half ago. Turns out I have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). Basically, this means that the follicles in my ovaries do not mature and ovulate, and instead stay small as cysts.  My bloodwork all came back normal, so this was confirmed with ultrasounds and the fact that I wasn't getting periods. 

OP (and everyone else here with very irregular periods) should definitely get checked out by an obgyn or endocrinologist to determine the cause!5
