You absolutely need to be aware of the current scientific literature.  [91-95 percent of rapes are committed by serial offenders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iZCWfYZ9IU&feature=youtu.be&t=21m45s).  

He will probably do it again.  He's probably done it since his early teens.

Here is the wording used in one of the studies.

See [page 5](http://www.davidlisak.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/RepeatRapeinUndetectedRapists.pdf) of the Lisak study.


>For a participant to be classified among the group of rapists and attempted rapists in
this study, he would have to have responded "yes" to one of the following questions

>1. Have you ever been in a situation where you tried, but for various reasons did not succeed, in having sexual intercourse with an adult by using or threatening to use physical force (twisting their arm, holding them down, etc.) if they did not cooperate?
2. Have you ever had sexual intercourse with someone, even though they did not want
to, because they were too intoxicated (on alcohol or drugs) to resist your sexual
advances (e.g., removing their clothes)?
3. Have you ever had sexual intercourse with an adult when they didn't want to
Because you used or threatened to use physical force (twisting their arm; holding
Them down, etc.) if they didn't cooperate?
4. Have you ever had oral sex with an adult when they didn't want to because you
Used or threatened to use physical force (twisting their arm; holding them down,
etc.) if they didn't cooperate?

>Any participant who responded "yes" to one of these questions was asked a series of follow-up questions regarding their age, the victim's age, the number of times it happened,
Whether it happened with another person , and if so, the frequency of other instances or the
Number of other victims (this last question varied depending on the version of the API used).

You just described 2.  It was a rape.  If you asked past partners would you find similar behavior?  The scientific literature suggests he may be dangerous to many others in the future.

> Within the universe of 3,698 violent acts that the
1,882 men in this sample were responsible for, the 76 repeat rapists by themselves accounted for 1,045 of that total. That is, representing only 4% of the sample,the repeat
rapists accounted for 28% of the violence. Their level of violence was nearly ten times that
of non-rapists, and nearly three and a half times that of single-act rapists.
