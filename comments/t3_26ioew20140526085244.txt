Call people you like. Don't wait for them to call you, or just expect to spend time with them at school and that be enough. Make an effort to keep in touch with the people you care about, and do it enough so that it becomes a habit. 

Don't get excused from gym just because you hate running and sweating in front of others. Take weight training. Get muscles.

Try not to worry about not having dates or being popular. It'll all work out, and you'll be really happy one day.

Get a cell phone and car earlier, you fucking luddite.
