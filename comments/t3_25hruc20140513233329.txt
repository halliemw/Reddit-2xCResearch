Do you know what's worse than being single? Being in a shitty relationship because you think you're supposed to be in a relationship.

I spent ten years "working" on a relationship because I thought that was what I was supposed to do. Trying to get him to commit, trying to get him to plan for the future with me, trying to get him to agree to kids, and all that did was make two people incredibly unhappy. 

We split and I've been single for almost two years now, and I had no idea I even had the capacity to feel this amount of happiness, satisfaction, and peace.

You can't "effort" a relationship into existence. It happens or it doesn't. Sure, you can get out there and date - and you totally should if you want to spend time finding a relationship. But you should find a relationship that you want to be in, not because you feel that you should.
