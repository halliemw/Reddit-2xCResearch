I love that most of the medical related laws being made don't take into account the actual science and medical research being done. They base their decisions of fear mongering and retoric. 

Of course I'm sure these people are well aware that the US is the 49th most dangerous countries to give birth in and that you are especially at risk if you are poor and don't have access to care. But why focus on that complicated problem when we can throw addicts under the bus!
