You seem to be feeling relief that there's a chance he may not have sex with her. This relief seems to be adding an extra element to the situation. Because you should be less ok with the fact that he *has* betrayed you...publicly. All it took for him to disrespect you and your relationship was alcohol. You're also being naive if you think that when 2 people who have been holding hands and flirting, haven't done anything more sexual then that when they purposely left the group. Whether they had sex or not is kind of irrelevant, because there's very little doubt that he would have had he been capable.
