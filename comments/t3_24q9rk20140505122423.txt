I was on the bus and a drunk guy (I'm talking 'first time at the bar' drunk) sat next to me and would just not let up. Asking me to hold his hand and give him a kiss on the cheek and stuff.  I said "I'm trying to sleep and just have a peaceful ride home, okay, like...it's 3:00 am."  Not my politest moment, but whatever.  Then he goes "no no it's fine, I get it.  You really don't want to talk to me, do you?"  

No.  I don't.

Then he says "okay I have to tell you something...I lied about my age.  I'm not 23, I'm only 19"  and I said "yeah, I guessed that." So anyway, he keeps going on being hammered and asks me where I'm getting off, and where I live.  And I said "I'm getting off at Brampton, my boyfriend and I live near blah blah blah." 

He literally was taken aback.  He physically backed away from me.  And then he goes "oh, you REALLY should have told me that.  Are you guys like really serious?  Do you think he's the one?"

OMG SORRY BRO, I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE THE ONE HAVING A HARD TIME HERE.   I FEEL SO BAD FOR YOU.

We've been dating for two years, but I mean...not *married.*  You still have a chance! /s
