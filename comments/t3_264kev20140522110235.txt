I'm a lazy person and don't like to think about what I have to wear in the morning so I personally would find it handy to have a uniform so I didn't have to think about it. By saying this apparently I'm saying that fascism is awesome? Also many work places DO have uniforms, are they also past of the Fascist regime? TIL that uniforms apparently equal fascism (or that you support Mussolini). Good to know.
