Of course culture, nationality, upbringing will all mean that women will have different experiences. Saying that unrealistic body standards is something that affects all women (or at least western women) isn't the same thing as saying those experiences are irrelevant. This should be something that all women can get behind.

Edit: Would one of the people downvoting consider actually articulating why. All I'm getting at the moment is that people 'feel' that what I'm saying is wrong, but can't actually say why. I know you  guys in the US have some particular issues with race, but has it really got to the point where you can no longer discuss the issues that span race and culture?
