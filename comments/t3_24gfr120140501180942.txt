Comedians don't and shouldn't have to apologize for material. He didn't apologize for his joke (whether you hate it or not) because he doesn't have to. Talking without knowing the severity of the topic on hand is ignorant and he apologized for that.

Personally I don't like what he said, but this is he first I've heard of D.L. Hughley in a very long time. I don't think he should have to apologize for the actual joke. And people just vilify him like his words were literally "shut up bitch if your man is making money and he hits you". You can tell he was just winging the bit even after just reading he transcript. In a persona, he generalizes, "women be crazy blah blah".
