I started my period at age 8 in third grade. The most important thing I can think of is explain to her what is going on and what she is going to need to know to take care of her hygiene. It happened before any of the school videos or anything explaining what was happening and it made me have to find out all the information on my own, which made for an awkward few weeks of library check outs, since the internet wasn't really available at the time.
