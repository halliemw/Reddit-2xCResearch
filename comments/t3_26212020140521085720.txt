What is being done by the mods right now to ensure that they have made the right decision?

Is there a short-, medium-, or long-term plan to examine the effects of defaulting us in order to decide whether default status should continue?

How about a user survey on the topic?  How long have you been a member, how often do you visit, what's your opinion on default status, etc.?  I volunteer to set it up if you like.
