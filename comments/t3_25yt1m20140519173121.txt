I don't think being good friends with your mother is truly the NORM.  Maybe for your friends it is, but there is so much variation in how people relate to their parents there may not even be a norm.

As I see it, you have your mom and your have your friends.  Why does your mom need to be a friend as well?

Try to relate as best you can, try to leave as many encounters with her as possible feeling positive - and that may be all that you can do.

I struggle with this.. because, hey, raised by narcissists but also my mothers communication skills are terrible.  I feel like we are talking about two different things ALL THE TIME.
She also very frequently says things like "Why would ANYONE want to do that?" regarding something I'm doing - eg going to the gym, doing those "mud runs" etc.
Looking down on healthy physical activity when she is 100lbs overweight, it's fucking laughable.  It's very annoying and sometimes I just want to scream SHUT THE FUCK UP, or even punch her.  But I hold it in, practice deflection, re-direction or let the conversation die.
