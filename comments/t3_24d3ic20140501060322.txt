The decisions may not always be easy, but they are personal decisions. There isn't a right or wrong answer as to what to do (which test, screening vs. surgery) or when to do it (now vs. later) - it should be in your best interests for what works best for you, as long as it's medically reasonable/appropriate. 


With whatever the outcome and with whatever you choose, I wish you only the best.
