Maybe if the movie was about something different. This is the equivalent of people being surprised that they don't talk about anything but ruining the 'bad guys' plan in any action movie. It's outside the scope of the story because it doesn't move the plot along. Could movies be better about this? Absolutely. But everyone shouldn't get angry that a single movie, intended to be a silly comedy doesn't work to defy gender stereotypes. 

Edit: To reply to some comments below, the point I am trying to make is that the plot of the movie is what drives the dialogue and characters. It wouldn't fit right if all of a sudden the characters were discussing some narrative back story with one another. Was anyone pissed in Ocean's 11 when all they talked about was how they were going to rob the casino? No, because that was the plot. What about in Saving Silverman where all they talk about is the women? My point is that to tear apart a movie that was meant to be a silly dumb flick because it doesn't meet certain merits isn't the best argument to why women should be better represented in film. I agree that on the whole there is a problem, but this movie is not a good representation of the issue.
