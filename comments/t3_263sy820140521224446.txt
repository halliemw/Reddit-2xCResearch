I had heard of the hormones caused by sex leading to increased bonding behaviors, but I'd always assumed it was equal on both sides. That sort of blows for straight women, if that's how it works.

Your second point made me giggle, thank you. And while I get where you're coming from, intentionally providing shitty sex seems like a poor option. Maybe I'll just mark this is up as another reason to limit the number of sexual encounters per partner.
