First off, I saw downthread you said you were new to TwoX, so welcome! 

Second - I'm a cis woman who also doesn't have periods and can't bear children. Nevertheless, you and I are still women. Anyone who would say otherwise has issues of their own that they need to sort out, and that's not our problem. (Although dealing with them on a daily basis CAN be a problem, but that's where you need friends and a supportive community around you!)

Finally, I just wanted to say you seem like a sweetheart, and I'm really glad you're here!
