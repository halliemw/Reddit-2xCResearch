I don't know you or your history with your S.O., so I will just tell you a little of mine:  My college sweetheart was sexy and passionate and so smart. He often accused me of having a "flirty personality" and that I sought out attention from men.  If he saw me being too friendly with another man, ANY other man, things could get really bad (yelling, slamming stuff, mean mean words). He would say that he could see what I was thinking, that when I talked to other men he could tell that I wanted them to like me. He felt that men couldn't be blamed for how they reacted to me, it was my fault, I was attracting them on purpose. (When he made me cry, he also accused me of crying on purpose, to make him feel bad).  It got so bad that one day, I was jogging at a park.  I saw a group of guys playing basketball up ahead and I idly wondered if they were cute. I stopped in my tracks, and turned around because my boyfriend had gotten so in my head that I was worried when I got back from my jog he would notice somehow, that I had purposefully run by a group of guys, playing basketball to get their attention.  I ran the other way to avoid those random, basketball playing guys. That was my life with him, avoiding eye contact with any man I came across, being careful not to smile too much or joke with men who weren't my family, worried that he would get mad at me if I smiled at a cashier or waiter.  I'm single now. It's glorious.
