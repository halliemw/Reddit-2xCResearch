I'm already finding myself thinking that this isn't the place for me, but as I said above, I really like the job itself. I've learned that the workplace is just that - a place for work, so it amazes how they are managing to make me feel this way. I'm not looking for friends, but I do spend  a big chunk of my time with these people, so I just want all of the "high school mean girl clique" attitudes to stop so I can do my job. I'm glad you're happy you got laid off though! Hope your new situation is better.
