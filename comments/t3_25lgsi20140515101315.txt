It helps SO much. Thank you!! We've planned to get a cabin in the mountains over Christmas and just hole up together for a week or so. I'm sure he'll come visit during the summers. You're so right that breaking it up into smaller chunks of time will help! I don't have to last two years without him, just four months. That's not impossible. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to relay your experience to me. I feel a little drop in the pit of my stomach when I think about it, but if we think of cool things we can do when we're together and apart, maybe it'll be a fun experience rather than a lonely one.
