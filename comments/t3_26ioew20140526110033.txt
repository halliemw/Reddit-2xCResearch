It's OK to say "no."

My parents fights weren't my fault. 

Believe in myself. Apply to better schools. Stop seeing myself as my failures.

Keep track of nutrition and calories for just one week just so I would understand what I'm putting into my body. (I'm overweight now, but I've been all over the map with food. I think this would have been the start of a healthier relationship.)
