It's not so much the actual skills that are valuable as it's the *confidence* that comes from having the skills. Attackers look for victims - people who look like an easy target. 

Remember though, most of us have been conditioned not to fight, and in an attack situation we are already on the back foot as the attacker is mentally ahead of us in that respect. They don't have those built-in sanctions against using violence to get what they want.

Most of us who are able to sit about and comment on reddit live incredibly safe lives. We aren't in the middle of war. We don't have militias roaming our streets. We aren't homeless and vulnerable. Most of the people we are going to interact with are not going to attack or hurt us any more than we are going to attack or hurt other people.

Yes, there are terrible things in the world, and terrible people - but they are the minority. Don't live your life in fear of the world. I'm not saying put on your rose coloured glasses and blithely skip through the world as if it is all rainbows and unicorns ... just don't shrink away from the world and feel afraid you must be constantly vigilant to be safe.
