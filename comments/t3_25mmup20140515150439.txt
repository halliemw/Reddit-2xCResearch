I can't speak for every university, but at the public university I went to, the town police did not have jurisdiction on campus. The campus police were a real police force, but they were funded in part through the university. Granted I never heard of them not taking assaults seriously and they were not on the list of those under investigation for Title IX violations in their handling and reporting of sexual assaults.
