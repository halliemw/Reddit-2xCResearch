Honestly, I think the question itself is pretty problematic. There really isn't any way to define womanhood without excluding huge numbers of people.

The closest I can think of to determining what makes a woman is determining what *doesn't* make a woman.

* Chromosomes fail, because not even every "natural" woman is XX, and it excludes trans women by definition.
* Femininity fails, because there are plenty of butch women who are still women.
* Kindness fails, because women are not intrinsically more kind than men are.
* Genitals fail for the same reason as chromosomes, with the addition of people who were ambiguous at birth and had surgery to "fix" them.
* Motherhood and maternal instincts fail, again because they exclude trans women (at least the motherhood part) as well as infertile women, and those of us who just have no maternal drives.
* How you dress fails, because kilts are a thing (and let's face it, that's basically a skirt (unless it's the big wrap around authentic version, in which case it's more of a thick woollen sari) sorry guys) even before we consider transvestitism.
* How you present to the world fails, since plenty of trans people present as their "natural" gender for a very long time before they come out.
* Who you're attracted to fails, because then gay men would be women, lesbians would be men, and asexual people would be gender neutral.
* Body shape fails, because plenty of women have masculine builds, while plenty of men have feminine builds.

The only defining factor about gender I can think of that doesn't fall down under scrutiny is how you identify. Bear in mind that "man" and "woman" are ancient terms built up long ago in the mists of human history when ambiguity between the genders wasn't really recognised by society. They are, at least in my opinion, artificially rigid terms used to describe remarkably fluid aspects of humanity. I think this is why we always fail when we try to define womanhood as a concrete thing. You *can* put the mist in a bottle, and it'll fit to the bottle, but as soon as you open the lid it'll drift away and lose all of its definition, so I don't think there's much point in trying to give it a shape.
