1. Are you comfortable watching a baby eat from a bottle? 

2. Are you uncomfortable when a baby starts gumming at his/her hands or on his/her dad's finger or on his/her mom's shoulder? 

I'm assuming watching a baby eat doesn't upset you. I'm assume watching a baby gum and gnaw on things doesn't bother you. If the baby eating isn't what is upsetting you, then it is the use of the breast as food that upsets you. You need to understand that that is your own hang-up, then: a product of our culture that overly-sexualizes breasts.
