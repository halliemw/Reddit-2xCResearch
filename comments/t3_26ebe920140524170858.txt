You're right, it shouldn't, but it does. Rape cases oftentimes aren't viewed as "important" as other cases. Sometimes it takes them so long to process them that the statute of limitations passes. And I remember a story from several years ago that regarded a particular police department being behind on rape kits by two decades. I'm probably most definitely wrong on how far behind they are, but it was an incredibly long time.
