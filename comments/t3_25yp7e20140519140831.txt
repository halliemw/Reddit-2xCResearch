You could have a depression. You could try antidepressants. Go talk to your psychiatrist. (By the way: have you told him how you feel?).

There are some "outside factors" that could influence your current mental state. Perhaps living closer to your family would give you more support and make you happier. Perhaps dating a man who hasn't been divorced /doesn't have a complicated background would make you happier. Perhaps a more challenging job, or a job where you would be praised more often, would be helpful.

But the external factors are not the only thing. How you think about them is also important. If you tell me this story, I would say: hurray, you are dating! (Hopefully he's also a nice sweet guy). Hurray! You've got a job! Hurray! You've got family (even though they live three hours away). 

So the way you look at things makes things worse. Good therapy and/or pills could help with that.
