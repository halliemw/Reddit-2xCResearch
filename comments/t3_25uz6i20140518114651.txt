Use cold pressed coconut oil. It is an incredible all-natural lube and it even tastes good! It doesn't leave your skin feeling all gross and slimy/sticky like that nasty chemical lubey stuff. It's inexpensive--you can get it at any health food store or online and a little goes a long way! I swear by it. I've told my friends about it and they've all become converted coconut oil users as well. Make sure it's cold-pressed!

Bonus: you can also use it as moisturizer, make-up remover (makes your eyelashes grow really strong/long/healthy), you can cook with it, etc etc. The possibilities are endless!
