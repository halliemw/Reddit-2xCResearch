Yeah, that sums up how I feel completely, I just couldn't find the words for it. I want to be there for her when things are terrible and she really needs me, but they're *always* so terrible that she needs me, and all the solutions we come up with together just get dropped when she goes back to him. And on top of that, she'll say "Oh I tell you so much horrible shit about him that you're biased against him now", so it's just another round of explaining why that's irrelevant when he's treating her like shit before getting into the real problems.
