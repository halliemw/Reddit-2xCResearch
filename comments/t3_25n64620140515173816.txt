First off, I don't see a pregnant woman as "disabled" or "elderly." Also, if we want to be treated as independent and strong women, we can't get mad when that independence eliminates a historical "comforts" or "courtesies."  Just my opinion.  As many others pointed out, perhaps people aren't sure whether a woman is pregnant or just obese.
