I don't really know the format of your group, but I assume there's a talkback element to it. Say your piece. If he's dissmissive, say "Listen. This is art, and you get to make art about whatever you want. But I'm allowed to feel whatever I want in response, and I'm allowed to voice those feelings. It's not that I don't understand your art, I just don't agree with it." Also, ask him why he likes the stuff he likes. If he's making caricatures of misogynist porn because he's trying to make a statement about the objectification of women, tell him he needs to do a better job expressing his message. But if he's doing it because he hates women, get him to say it out loud. 

Maybe graphic material isn't grounds for removal, but continued failure to take constructive criticism and cultivating an unsafe environment for members of the group totally is. I can appreciate that the leader is in a tough position--to ban this guy would be an active choice, and if he makes the passive choice all of the women just sort of leave and he can pretend it's not his fault. But you can explain to him that what he's doing is issuing a de facto ban against anyone who's made uncomfortable by illustrations of graphic rape i.e. a lot of people.

So yeah, **TL;DR** force the issue in-group. Be the bitch (because who cares?). If he's really that behind his art, make him defend it. Hopefully people will stop being able to pretend that it's just about art for him and be forced into action.
