Talk to your professors.  Talk to your professors.  

Seriously, they are human beings and understand this kind of stuff.  You were a model student before this happened.  That buys you a lot of credibility when life causes you to slip up.  They can offer you some options so that you don't have to take a failing grade, such as an incomplete.  And your math prof might be more lenient than you expect in the circumstances; she probably wants to discourage people who try to get out of a bad grade because they took a test hungover and stuff like that.

If they AREN'T understanding, take it over their heads.  My guess is your university has a formal bereavement policy, and also policies covering students who become ill (depression counts).
