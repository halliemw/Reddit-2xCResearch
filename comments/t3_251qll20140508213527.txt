All that is feminism is about equality, but not all that is about equality is feminism. 

This issue is very complicated, however. Feminism seeks equality by attempting to end hierarchal arrangements of groups within social relationships, as well as oppression. Feminism most explicitly challenges sexist hierarchies and oppression, but women within certain groups will experience sexism in different ways. This is why feminists also focus on issues regarding race, class, sexuality, etc. (this is the theoretical framework known as intersectionality). Feminism, therefore, deals with a very broad notion of equality.
