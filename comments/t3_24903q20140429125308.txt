From my understanding it's a way to keep costs down, for a small handful of patients on Remicade could quite quickly add up to a significant cost to the hospital. 

In my mind one of the main deficiencies in the Universal Health Care in Canada is the lack of a single payer system/subsidization for prescriptions, another being a lack of coverage of Dental procedures. It would be really awesome if we had a [system like New Zealand](http://www.health.govt.nz/your-health/conditions-and-treatments/treatments-and-surgery/medications/prescription-charges) where we just pay a small token fee for medications.
