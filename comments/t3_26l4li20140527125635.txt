No, this isn't. Or at least, I hope for Laci's sake it isn't.

/u/thesilvertounge is presenting no evidence that it is misogynistic, and is being hostile and dismissive to everyone who's asking for evidence or pointing out the lack thereof. [When somebody actually presents an argument that's relevant to the discussion]( 
http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26l4li/sex_video_about_elliot_rodger_no_its_not_all_men/chsa93s) instead of being dismissive and close-minded, it's very easy to admit what is going on.

I am not a villain for not blindly accepting someone's idea when all they are doing is twisting their opposition's words into strawmen and refusing to present any evidence of the claim being made, and I am not a villain for calling them out on it.

I *would* be "villain" of sorts for refusing to change my stance on the issue, but I have changed my stance once somebody finally presented a reason to.
