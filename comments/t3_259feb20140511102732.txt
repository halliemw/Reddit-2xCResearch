Hey /u/Lucifurnace, yeah we do come here to vent about menstruation and street harassment--but there are also threads about graduation, joy and plenty of other happy things.  Just like the news, however, we tend to hear more of the bad.

I'd say this is largely because when you're happy you might have less inclination to make a reddit post.

/u/iatemysocks gave you several of her reasons it's awesome to be a woman, there are so many more than that!  Once in a while we get reminded that society isn't equal and it can be rather jarring, that's what a lot of us come here to rant about, but this isn't every one of us every day (in most cases).  

You can do your best to foster trust in you, help develop self esteem through accomplishing and learning new things, warn her about some of the potential dangers (but don't scare her, give her tools to handle things--particularly online).  It's not so different from being a boy really--every child needs to learn to navigate the adult world, the specifics are a bit different, but the need is the same.
