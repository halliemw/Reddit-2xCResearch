He's a hard read. I get the sense that it still stings a little, but then he'll go and make an off-color abortion joke and I think all is well (we have dark senses of humor). 

It took a LONG time to get to this point though. A couple years, at least. I just don't bring it up.

There was a point where he couldn't really talk to me, or maybe it was that I was reading too much into his words (though sparse)... I don't really know. But after we could have normal conversations again without me thinking there was a "you killed my unborn child" undertone, it just stopped being an issue.
