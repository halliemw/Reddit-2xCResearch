It's okay to not have feelings for her. You told her that she's not your type and that's fine! You're not obligated to reciprocate feelings for someone, even if they're your best friend. Please don't feel guilty about it. I've been in this situation as well, and my situation wasn't the same as yours, but it didn't absolutely destroy our friendship. I am also ace so I understand :p

Long story short: don't feel guilty, because it's not your fault. If she's your best friend she'll be okay with it. It'll be awkward for a little while, but that should go away. :)
