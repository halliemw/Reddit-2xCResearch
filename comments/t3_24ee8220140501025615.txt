*Hugs*. You are already so strong for someone so young. I wish the best of luck to you in this new chapter of your life. 

I am 21 years old and I also live alone in a big city. My parents live far away, too. It sounds like you have your sister to keep you company, so that's good. I know one of the biggest challenges of moving was the loneliness of living alone. That being said, I now adore it. I've utilized the alone time to explore and discover what type of person I am and what I want to be. I'm certain the same will happen with you! It's exciting to look forward to. 

In case you do find yourself alone often, here's some things I do to help fight the disquietness of an empty apartment:

* Read, read, read. Books are truly the best company. If you want any recommendations, PM me.

* Learning to cook. Pinterest has become my best friend (and my waist line's worst enemy).

* Exercise. This is coming from someone who *hates* running. But, I've been taking cycling classes at my local YMCA and doing yoga at home and I'm actually enjoying it. 

* On that note, yoga. [This girl](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjgXQkHWH453km2BpJqYHzmkUkkjH5IB) has a YouTube channel with a wonderful 30 day program, if you are interested. 

* Write. I'll blog till my fingers hurt! So great to vent with no inhibitions. 

* Listen to podcasts. Great background noise for mundane tasks like dishes or laundry. Comedy, literature, news, whatever (although, you can never go wrong with This American Life). 

* Practice improving my makeup skills. /r/MakeupAddiction is the best place for advice, tips, tutorials, so on. And it's fun!  

* LOTS of Netflix. Just finished House of Cards...for the second time.   

* [Here is a link](http://freeintenyears.com/frugal-tips/100-cheap-hobbies/) to a website full of affordable hobby ideas. I've recently picked up calligraphy and gardening. 

* Talk on the phone. I'll call my mom, grandmother, or friends from the past to catch up. 

I'm not familiar with what you have had to experience in the past whatsoever, but I do know what it's like to be a little fish in a big pond. I hope this has helped in some way. You already have such an inspiring outlook. Best of luck.
