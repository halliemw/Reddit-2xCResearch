The name does bother me a little, but I do realize that we are a pretty small minority by compaison, much the same as I'm sure there are women on here with other various chromosonal disorders who don't have XX.

I did not expect this subreddit to be accepting of me at frist, however I have never felt even the slightest inclination of non-accpetance here. If there are people on here who are unaccepting they at least have the dencency to keep it to themselves. Quite honestly this is the only women's specific group I have ever felt really accepted in.
