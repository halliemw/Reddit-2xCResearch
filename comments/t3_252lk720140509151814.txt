It's kind of split to be honest. Iran is a fairly young country at this point, demographically speaking. What you have to understand is that a lot of the 'older' people were my age or younger when the Islamic Revolution happened. It was a very confusing time. I could go on and on about it, but I think the comic that BEAUTIFULLY put it together is Perspolis my Marjane Satrapi. It's a two volume graphic novel that was later turned into a movie (that was then nominated for an Oscar.) It really explains how a lot of people that they were revolting the Shah for a democratic republic, and then it all went to shit, and the people who were Islamic extremists were the ones with guns. 

So a lot of those people who disagreed with the new regime immigrated  elsewhere (my mother for example came to America,) but those who were denied visas or just couldn't bear to depart for their home country stayed and festered with hate against what was going on. And on the flip side kids who were raised here are OK (or just kind of go with it) with the current regime. I think it's fair to say that across the board in all demographics, majority don't like how it currently is. 

I mean, the president people elected doesn't even have full power compared to Ayatolla Khameni. Rohani wants to do major change (for example he says that as a nation we CANNOT advance with working with the US, and that he AS A PRACTICING MUSLIM cannot see how the nation can fully blossom without treating women with more respect and equality (in so many words.))
