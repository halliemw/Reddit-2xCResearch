I think your ATM example is out of line, but I am trying to come up with a better one. Comparing a loss of money to being physically and emotionally violated are very different things. Basically, no matter how much women would like to wear whatever they want in public, it will still be a long time coming before men are able to look at them not sexually. And those who lack self control, whether it be due to mental illness or cultural acceptance, could potentially take advantage of a rape-y situation if the woman is not being aware of their surroundings. This goes for men too.
