You know that there's a superheroine movie starring Scarlet Johanson coming out this year, right? It's called "Lucy", I think. And Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman is probably intended as a hook for her subsequent appearance in either a standalone WW movie or the JLA movie, or even both if it's profitable.
