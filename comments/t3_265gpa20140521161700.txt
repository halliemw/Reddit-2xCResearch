I've found almost all of my living situations through craigslist and I've never had a problem. Do you plan to share an apartment or get your own? 

* Don't give out your social security number, banking information, passport information.

* Make sure you get an agreement in writing before you give any money. If they insist on cash, be wary. Cheques/money orders are better.

* First & last months rent upfront are pretty typical for my area. More than that and I would be concerned

* Read a bunch of descriptions on craigslist before you start responding. You'll start to see whats normal and whats abnormal/weird.

* Ask why the room is available, it's probably because their roommate is doing an internship somewhere else for the summer. Meet the people in person, if you can. Use your intuition to determine if they are creepy.

* Ask questions about guests, pets, parties, noise levels, kitchen usage, bathroom usage, typical bed times...

* If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Don't bother with things significantly below the typical price for your area.

* Read about your country's rental rights for subletting. It's really hard to mess with people who know whats legal and what is not.

* If you are concerned about your physical safety, consider rooming with other female students, other women, or a family.
