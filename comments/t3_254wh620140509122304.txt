I haven't had a chance to see if there are any mod responses in either of those threads, but with everything going on before making any new changes we do think this big change should be settled first. Making any rule changes right now would be detrimental and would confuse the issue we're already dealing with. I'll give you my personal opinions on both those threads:

Making a rule telling guys they aren't welcome would be the antithesis of what we've always been about no matter how subtle we were about it. We already remove posts from guys that are more suitable for askwomen or relationships, that won't change.

As for gendered flair, I wouldn't like it personally, I'm more inclined to think we should just assume everyone posting here is a woman unless otherwise noted since this is our subreddit. I did have a terribad idea of using automod to remove any comment that has the words "as a man" in it... but seriously, terrible idea I think?
