Here in Louisiana the facilities are extremely far and inbetween. There is also the absurd requirement that you must visit said facility,  and sit in some rediculous class and then ..THEN they make you wait 24 hours before you can make that decision for yourself.

I find that absolutely insane,  this is from a guys perspective.
