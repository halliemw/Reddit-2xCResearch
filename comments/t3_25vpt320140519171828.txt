I don't have any scientific information to back this up, but it's long been known as a folk remedy for many things. Supposedly acetic acid boosts your metabolism, helps prevent water retention, helps indigestion, etc. It's also great applied topically to your face (when diluted) because it helps return skin to its healthy pH, so I wonder if it has skin benefits when ingested as well. Basically, who knows if it's actually doing anything, but it makes me feel like I'm doing something good for myself. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
