This isn't really a place to 'ask women' (there is a sub for that), it's more for discussions related to women's issues. Men are welcome here (I am a man myself), but it isn't for men to ask questions about a non gendered issue that could be answered by either sex.

But oh well, doesn't matter - you've seen the response. This was unacceptable behavior on your 'friends' part. I would cut communication with this person myself. You can confront them if you feel the need to and telling the police is also not out of the question as this person clearly has a warped view of how they are allowed to treat others sexually.
