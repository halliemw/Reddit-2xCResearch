No, I  just tend not to read bullshit on a regular basis. I don't understand how someone can say this sounds like a man wrote it when it very clearly implies it was written by a woman. 

What about this makes it seem like it was written by a man? Is it the cursing? Or is it how frank she is? I am genuinely confused how you came to this opinion, since she is writing about her vagina in detail. To me and to a lot of people, there's no way we would think "This sounds disingenuous. A dude definitely wrote this. I can tell from the word choice." That sounds silly to me.
