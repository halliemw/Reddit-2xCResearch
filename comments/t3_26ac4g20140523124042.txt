To answer your question, it depends. As far as I know there isn't one group setting standards for this kind of thing. Age, height, etc can all be used to inform standards, and often are, but gender is much more useful in setting standards.

And in regards to your other question, I think you're missing the point. Physically fit people can do the jobs that require these kinds of tests, and the situations in which they would need to use their fitness on the job aren't easily replicable. Requiring a prospective firefighter to be able to squat 200 pounds (or whatever it actually is) only disqualifies otherwise excellent candidates
