Do you really think pregnancy is just an inconvenience? Have you ever met a woman with a difficult pregnancy? Pregnancy can and often does do permanent damage to your body. It can induce diabetes, tear your abdominal muscles, and even kill you if you have an existing health conditions. 

Even if it's healthy, it often leaves you nauseous, causes your limbs to swell, requires you to take off work; plus, at the end, you can look forward to probably several hours of agony while your vagina is literally ripped open or you abdomen is sliced open, your organs removed (temporarily put on the table beside you, that is), and a baby cut out of your uterus.

It's much more than inconvenient. And even if it were only inconvenient, I don't ever get to inconvenience you by demanding you give me your blood, or organs, or bone marrow, even though I'm a person who might need them to live. You can donate them if you want, but even if you were somehow the cause of my needing a donation of any of those things, you're not legally obligated to give them to me because you have a right to control of your body.
