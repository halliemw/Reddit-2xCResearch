 > wanted some advice from real women rather than listen to someone who perhaps may have never personally had the device fitted

While it's likely that your GP has never personally had an IUD fitted (I'm assuming your GP is female), she has more than likely fitted many other patients with them. Also, she if she is an MD, she should know plenty to answer any of the questions you might have. She didn't go through at least 7-8 years of medical training just to have you get individual opinions from untrained people on the internet.

I'm not saying it's wrong to ask everyone's opinion on here, but take their advice with a grain of salt for sure because with stuff like IUDs, individual results may vary! If you want more "tailored" advice for what you're looking for, you might even want to check out /r/xxfitness as there are probably more of them who can answer your question better. However, still ask your GP about it because they will likely have a good answer for you.

 > I have recently started weightlifting and am frightened that squats and deadlifts might dislodge the IUD as I've heard they do move tampons!

As far as my opinion goes, are you saying that squats and deadlifts move tampons? That's how I took it... Tampons are placed in the vagina and the IUD is (obviously) in the uterus. The external os of the cervix should not open wide enough to actually *dislodge* the IUD, but there might be a chance of it shifting. That is, unless you're going to be squatting over 200 lbs (which I'm just assuming is unlikely since you said you recently started weightlifting). With the tampon, however, you may contract the pelvic floor muscles surrounding the vagina enough and in such a way that it very well could dislodge the tampon.
