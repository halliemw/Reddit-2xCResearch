Hey, I read the whole thing, and I shouldn't have made that statement. I apologize, that was rude of me. 

And I just like to wear what I want. I don't have a fantastic body, but if people feel comfortable wearing uber thin leggings, I really don't have a problem with it. 

But again, I apologize. I shouldn't have been an asshole:)
