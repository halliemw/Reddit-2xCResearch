Facing it is a major step. I had to do a similar thing in the past. To me it was amazing how the antidepressants worked for me. They do not change who you are. They do not change things that you feel strongly about. You won't become a zombie without feelings of happiness or sadness. Definitely not. 

However, for me they made it easier to think less negative thoughts and more positive thoughts. It's a bit hard to explain, but while my world was exactly the same when I was depressed and when I was on antidepressants, when I had been on the antidepressants for long enough, I could again appreciate the good parts of my world, and I could handle the less good parts with more ease. 

(Disclaimer: I had to switch from antidepressant 1 to antidepressant 2... The first one had the side effect of me always having a dry mouth, which became a real nuisance, even though it was also working). 

It made me see even more how your viewpoint influences how you feel, and how two people can look at the same reality and one will be happy or satisfied, while the other will be sad and depressed. I took them for roughly a year or so and made some necessary changes to my life during that time (being on the antidepressants gave me the energy to make those changes), so that I could also come off them again. I have been without them for three years now and I'm doing fine. 

You don't absolutely *need* to go on antidepressants, but I would discuss the option with your shrink and compare it to other possible options. Is your shrink any good, by the way? If you don't feel a connection to your shrink and you don't think anything he says is working, then perhaps switching therapists might help.
