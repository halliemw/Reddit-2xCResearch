Well that's good then, I would probably try and stick with the mirena because it is reliable and doesn't risk all the issues hormonal contraception can have.
In a way, it will be a much harder ride if it does come down to stress related things. There isn't anything that you have that couldn't be explained by something like that, but you still need to rule everything else out. The chances are there isn't anything 'wrong' that you need to really worry about, but at least if there is something you'll find out soon. 
I hope you start to feel better! Definitely try all the stress relieving things like exercise/yoga/whatever hobbies you may have, it will help you feel better whatever the cause is. 
This isn't completely applicable to your situation, but it's a decent illustration of what some people go through http://blog.billhurst.com/lawyer-login-panel/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Chronic-Pain-Cycle.png
