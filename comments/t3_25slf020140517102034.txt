No, I didn't. This was a while ago before I even thought or had the courage to say something. There was another girl who felt similarly but we were honestly just glad we were working a job that wasn't selling clothes or coffee and something bordering our interests and was slightly above min. wage. She actually would receive text messages from said GM that would include "You drive me so crazy, you're such a tease," "What are you into? I bet you're dirty," and her being compliant got her things like longer breaks or easier tasks.
