Well its tricky. You may have heard of the case in Boston where they ruled that taking upskirt pictures were legal as long as the women weren't fully nude, and as the boys took the photo off her clothed rear end, they really didn't do anything illegal (depending where you live). It might be pervy and morally fucked but its not against the law to be creepy so I wouldn't do anything but ignore them.
