Big college town in Alabama. But I never get catcalled on campus, just in the town itself. Mostly when delivering pizzas and I don't quite understand it. My uniform isn't flattering at all and I know that the visor I wear doesn't look good with my hair. I never really experienced it until this year, but it's exploded this year. I don't think it's the college because I've been here for two years now, but I've been out and about way more in the town itself. It's not even downtown, but in residential areas and a few times in walmart.

I used to think it was something that only happened other places, not in towns that weren't big cities and a few times (pardon my ignorance) I thought that we were maybe more polite, because of the whole southern hospitality thing.
