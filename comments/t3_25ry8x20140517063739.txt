I'm glad you know exactly what constitutes a relationship and what does not. /s It sounds like the poster has a great relationship and that her and her bf are open and honest about what they want. It's not like she's randomly sleeping with someone and hiding it from her boyfriend, the open relationship is something they have decided on and worked to figure out.
