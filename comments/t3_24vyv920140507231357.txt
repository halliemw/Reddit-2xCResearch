I think that trigger warnings are important for their original purpose, but I find that increasingly they're being used for things that are not strictly "triggering" for trauma survivors, but simply things that some people may not want to see. I think that belittles the experience of these people. I've heard some people decide to move to "content warnings" (rather than trigger warnings) for that purpose and I like that better. It's the same thing but without the possible implications of trivializing triggering.
