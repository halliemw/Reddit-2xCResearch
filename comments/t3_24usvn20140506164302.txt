> he knows she likes him, he knows that if he asked she would jump into bed with him. 

And yet he still lets her sleep in the same bed with him (even when others are there), and still doesn't include you when they are hanging out?  I'm sorry, but I have a really hard time believing that anyone could possibly accept this situation as normal or reasonable.

As others have said, if you have been together for 2 years and he keeps you so separate from such an important part of his life, that is a sign that you have major issues in your relationship (unless you actually prefer it that way).
