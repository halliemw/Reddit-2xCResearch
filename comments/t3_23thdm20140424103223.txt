I wouldn't be upset. I don't really understand the people who are saying they're furious, either. Guy wanted a day off work, had a business-acceptable reason to do so. But that's just my opinion. It sounds like you're upset about it, and that's all that should matter. If you're upset, then go talk to him about it, and say why it makes you mad/uncomfortable.

However, if using the bereavement days now means that he can't come to the funeral with you, that's a different story. Then it would be selfish to purposefully make it so he can't come with you to an important event.
