There is something about the process in baking that I find relaxing. But I LOVE sharing my baked goods. Because I work from home, when I bake I often put a message on Facebook and offer to deliver cookies or brownies to whoever responds first, or I take them to the fire station around the corner from my house. Then people rave about how good it was. It's an ego boost :)
