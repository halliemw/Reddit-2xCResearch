>When I found out though, I went down to his quad and yelled at him mainly saying 'Unless a girl says something, SHE DOES NOT WANT IT."

This is why you are facing harassment charges.

>I don't want to get in trouble because HE decided to sexually assault 2 girls.

This was your action.  I'm not trying to belittle his actions, but you instigated this part, which as far as anyone else is concerned, is a separate incident from what he did.

You won't get in trouble for his actions, you can get in trouble for your actions, which happened separate from his.

That said.  Don't talk to him.  Do talk to your lawyer / advocate / whatever.  Do contact the police.  The university can't do anything of note.
