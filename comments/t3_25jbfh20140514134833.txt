It's definitely demeaning. I don't want to get too far into it because feminist politics have been getting a lot of shit on here lately, but to me it reflects the sexualization of youth in females, youth as something "good" or "desirable" because it shows submissiveness and subservience wheras in males it's seen as weak. Maybe I'm reading too far into it. Regardless, it's kind of gross and obnoxious. Maybe reply next time with a "thanks boy!"
