Mm, not quite, let me clarify- I started taking the pill in 2004, but I kept having "scheduled" periods for a good long while. It wasn't until 2012 that I consulted with my doctor and we decided that I should just start taking the pill continuously. So, I skip the placebo week and just start a new pack. It saves me money on pads and tampons etc, and I end up using about 17 packs of pills a year I think, as opposed to 13. (So about a $20 increase from my provider)

Though I've never had very heavy periods, once I was on the pill it was a MARKED difference, they went from lasting about a week to only about 3 and a half days.
