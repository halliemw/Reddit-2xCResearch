Well if it was just a case of him putting his foot in his mouth, I'd ignore it like I do most of the hot air that passes for political discourse. :)

But the bill he's planning to introduce sounds like *real* [bad news (this is from The Age)](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/tummy-eggs-multiply-antiabortion-mp-geoff-shaw-goes-viral-20140509-zr7xg.html#ixzz31CxPrhFV): 

>The major changes he wants to put forward are to outlaw gender-selection abortions, to force doctors to resuscitate babies who survive the abortion process, and to repeal section 8 of the legislation, which requires doctors who object to abortions to refer their patient to doctors who don't.

There doesn't even seem to be any evidence to suggest that gender-selection abortions are an issue here, so I don't understand why he's doing it, apart from as a very public way to troll. 

You have a good point about the writing and calling, although your ability to influence your member does depend on what seat you're in. :/
