Run away as fast as you can.  That is such a huge violation of trust that it can never be repaired.  That is beyond controlling, and beware of anyone (friend of beau) that uses phrases like "I wouldn't let you" make choices for yourself.  These are not people who genuinely care about you, regardless of the words they use to describe their feelings.

Good luck.  And if your paycheck won't come fast enough for the Plan B.  Email me.  I'll wire you the money.
