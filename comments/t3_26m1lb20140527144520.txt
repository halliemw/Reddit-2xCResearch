> No, that's called having a preference.

Sure everyone can have a preference. But there's a difference between tacitly agreeing to their preferences by not saying anything and asking them in response "Well, do you shave your legs?"

It's not about smashing a feminist book into their heads. It's about breaking the echo chamber that has led to the majority of men not even being hesitant to admit that they want women to remove a natural part of their bodies.

I find it funny that you specify "as a dating partner." This is not about who you, personally, would or would not date. This is about not judging people based on things that are none of your business.

If someone were to say "She's a total slut, she slept with the whole school," the appropriate response is "So?"

Can you point out the others that are incorrect and oversimplified?
