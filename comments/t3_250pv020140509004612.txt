Contact a lawyer, first and foremost to get the ball rolling on divorce proceedings. She doesn't necessarily need police documentation for that, but it varies by state to state. If I were her, I'd have some friends come and help me while he was gone, load up everything of value, my kids, etc...pack my car and high tail it as far away as I could get. New number and everything. But that would be so hard and I get that, but she has to do something and needs an outside source that is closer to these issues. Everyone already made some really good suggestions but the most important thing for her to keep in mind is that she HAS to break the cycle. When she's done this time, it has to be final because if she isn't successful, he could kill her.
