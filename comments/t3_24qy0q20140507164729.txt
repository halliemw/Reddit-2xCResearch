I can't imagine not showering in the morning before work. Adults really cant get away with that. Try showering in the morning every day and making sure your wearing clean natural Fibers. I find that rayon fiber many women's blouses are made of these days are awful for retaining smells, so try to avoid those. Check your shoes as well, that's often the culprit. Do you wear shoes without socks?
