Depo completely wiped out my period, but if you're planning on conceiving, it may not be the best choice. It can cause you to be infertile for up to 18mo after you stop getting injections. 

I have the upper arm implant now and it's awesome. Assuming everything is healthy and functioning normally, I will ovulate within a month of removal.
