OMG that's my job!  I am a Youth/Community Educator at a DV agency (been at the agency for 2 yrs, this job since Dec 2012) and also had to do a presentation for the interview and nailed it...Hell, I'm still staring at my interview presentation board as I type this.



First thing's first:  You **DO NOT** want to talk about anything other than COMMUNITY AND YOUTH EDUCATION.  You don't want to go in there and talk about how to improve any service OTHER THAN THE ONE YOU ARE APPLYING FOR.  This comes off as rude and disorganized.  Your presentation should focus solely on what your job is going to be.



>conduct public information and educational activities



THIS is what *you should* focus on because that will be your position.  



What I would recommend is creating a mini education presentation, and give it as if you are giving it to a community group or youth classroom.  For a DV non-profit you will most likely be interviewed by a number of people, so make sure you ask questions; make the presentation a dialogue rather than a one-way conversation.  Demonstrate your knowledge of domestic violence (Intimate Partner Violence vs other forms of DV - YOU MUST KNOW THIS!!!), myths and facts, respect for group disclosures of abuse (they WILL happen, they WILL happen in BIG GROUPS), and be comfortable and prepared to be challenged by people that don't believe what you are saying.  If you would like please PM me and we can talk more about an outline our helpful resources.
