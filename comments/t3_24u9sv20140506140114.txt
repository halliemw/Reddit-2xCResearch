I've done a lot of research on overactive bladder - it's not stress incontinence per se, but it's definitely related in many cases.  It's *extremely* common... but no one talks about it.

As I'm sure you know by now, there are medical treatments - some pharmaceutical, some non-pharmaceutical, some surgical (that's definitely a last resort, though).  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to ever talk about it with your doctor.  

I wish you luck.
