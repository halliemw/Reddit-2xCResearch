I also think there's a difference between an acting career and a career as an engineer or researcher or teacher or welder. I think as out-of-touch as the Gwyneth Paltrow quote sounds, she had a point. Being at work 8-10 hours a day and home most evenings and weekends is pretty different from being completely away from home for two or three weeks at a time and working 14 hour days when you are home. You can maybe take your children with you on those trips, but realistically you still won't see them much and you'll be uprooting them all the time so it's not really the best thing for them. 

Taking extended leave from a career like that might be necessary to bond with your children and really be a part of their lives, while my working parents were able to make it to our games and concerts and help us do our homework and learn to do home repairs and everything because they were home evenings and weekends. My dad was always on call and sometimes traveled for work, and once he rented a car and drove home overnight to make it to my brother's soccer game. My grandmother worked nights and slept when the kids were in school and was awake to interact and be a parent when they got home. It's possible to work a normal job and be a good parent, but I'm not sure it's possible to continually work as an actor and be a good parent without taking leave like Emma Thompson did. It sounds like she phrased it poorly and didn't mean that regular working moms needed to take a year off working to bond with their teenage children, just that she needed to because her job isn't exactly conducive to raising children and being home with them ever.
