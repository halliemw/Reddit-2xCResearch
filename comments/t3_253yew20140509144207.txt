How adorable and odd! My grandparents got together in a similar way. They went to high school together, but never dated. My grandfather was drafted not long after they graduated and all the sudden, out of the blue, he started sending her letters from the South Pacific. They ended up forming a long distance relationship and after the war, they "met" again, too!
