It is a good argument, I personally have a dislike of formal constitution (would one written even ten years ago have given suitable protection of gay rights and how would in address issues like the West Lothian question). 

In theory though the money paid in taxation in England funds NHS England, the taxation in Scotland funds NHS Scotland etc. In practice this is dealt with differently for each of the constituent nations. 

So there is no realistic reason why the Scottish NHS should have to pay for the health care of those resident in England. Emergency health care is a different matter. 

To put it in terms of individuals taxes, why should English tax payers be expected to pay for northern Irish health care, when they already slightly subsidize the northern Irish health care system.
