Communication skills are so useful, period.  Go for just yourself.  Don't worry about your husband; I think it's just like going to a doctor or getting help for anything, each party needs to decide it's right for them in order to get the most out of it.

Best advice that my husband and I got while in counseling was: remember you are both on a team.  Work together as a team.  When one of you does something that upsets the other, the person upset can help keep the situation calm by remembering the team, remembering that you both want the best for each other.

Just changing the mindset makes a world of difference.  I'm not saying it will overcome all relationship problems, mind, but for your run-of-the-mill communication issues based on bad timing and minor upsets, it ended up being a really useful thing for us when we went through a tough time some years ago.  We've been together for 15 years, for context.
