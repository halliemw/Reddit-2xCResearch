I contacted a domestic violence hotline and their advice was nearly in direct opposition to what most everybody has said here.  They said that getting the police involved if my mom was against it was a bad idea since it would put my mom in more danger.  They also said that I shouldn't make her go to at least one counselling session because she will see it like an intervention and that interventions don't work with abuse victims since there aren't any triggers.

Their advice was to make my mom feel good about herself, even if it takes years, but doing things such as (and I quote) "sending her fuzzy animal videos, or a really great magazine article, encourage her to take care of herself by eating right and getting enough sleep."  Essentially they repeated that this is my mom's concern and that my siblings and I shouldn't force our opinions on her (such as reporting to the police or getting mental help and guidance).  They said that while I think that witnessing a choking incident is a really big cause for concern, my mom has had to deal with things like this for years and it's not our place to make rash decisions for her.

My initial reaction agrees with a lot of people who have commented, but a DV hotline is directly opposed to nearly everything here.
