Oh, to be so, so so young. I read what you write and remember what it felt like to be 13. I remember the confusion. I remember being bullied. I was bullied into submission and had to delete my AIM account because I was so harassed growing up. I was a weird kid. And I know what it feels like to believe adults are being demeaning. Children are sometimes too smart for their own good, I was one of them, and you might be too. I demanded respect from 11 and was more mature than my peers by 14. At 22 I am still more mature than 90% of my peers, I've been told I'm an old soul and most of my friends are in their late 20s and 30s. You will understand one day. But please don't waste your childhood trying to grow up too fast. I beg that of you. You will spend the rest of your life wishing you were young again.
