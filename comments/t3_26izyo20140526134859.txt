> Anyway, I wish the FDA would let Vasalgel through.

Last time I checked they still hadn't tried to reverse the effect in humans. It might very well be reversible but, well... it *is* pretty important to make sure before they let it through.

To be honest I'm not quite sure how to feel about chemical birth control. It's great when you're in a serious relationship obviously, but when it comes to casual sex it seems to make people so lazy and downright irresponsible. It's scary how many people only care about pregnancy and outright ignore the risk of STDs.

That said, if it was available and safe (and definitely reversible), I'd probably go for Vasalgel -  but I'd still use condoms. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, I don't know.
