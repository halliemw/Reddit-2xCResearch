The only person who can decide if you're 'crazy' is you. You have to feel what's right for you. 

In my very humble opinion, I think you should at least talk to him about the affairs. You've obviously had a lot of meaningful experiences with this person, so it's completely natural to have difficulties letting them go. You care(d) for them, and they have hurt you. 

As someone who was on the flipside, I wouldn't have cheated or anything if I had just been listened to. It is possible to rectify and grow. It is possible for him to not cheat again, but it takes BOTH of you willing to step up and make changes to how you interact. You will need counseling, respect, careful distance and a LOT of communication. If you think you can get these from him, then you have to decide whether or not to try. If he isn't willing to put in that effort, then he isn't ready for an adult relationship. 

I'd suggest focusing on yourself first and foremost. You deserve respect, honesty and communication. You need trust in a relationship. If any of those cannot be met, then I would suggest and encourage you to move on, as hard as it may be.
