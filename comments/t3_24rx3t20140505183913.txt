I'm not sure about that. I used to be a part of the community long before it was "cool" and there were some a-holes back then. Just a lot of them were more like the Comic Book Guy from the Simpson's and harmless instead of sending death and rape threats. Maybe its more so now, because of the anonymity of the internet (or the use of high speed internet compared to how it was in the 90s) but there have always been creepers.
