You really don't need to be pressured into the perfect body

pressure towards being healthy is okay. but you can be healthy and overweight (but not healthy and (morbidly) obese). keep in mind that i'm talking about actual healthyness. not percieved nobakingveganglutensugarfunfree-brownie healthyness. 

70kg and 170cm is very much ok and not even close to chubby. don't let anyone tell you otherwise. you are fine.
