My mother is the most interesting person I've met. She was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, but spent her young life in Thailand. She was a little red-headed terror, from the stories I've heard. She spoke Thai before English. She spent her teenage years in Amman, Jordan. In high school, she wound up in the eastern plains of Colorado, far from the Swiss boarding school my grandfather had promised to send her. 

Growing up, my sister and I had the most amazing wardrobes to play with. My grandmother had been a socialite in Thailand, teaching English to well-off people and attending royal balls. She had some amazing dresses. My sister and I would also play dress up with my mother's clothes from Jordan. [Here's a picture of us on Halloween years ago, with her in one of her beautiful hand-embroidered Jordanian dresses.](http://imgur.com/s40Z5OP)
