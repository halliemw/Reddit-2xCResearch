The problem I'm having mostly comes from the fact that 90% of all of this takes place at my workplace and I work at the only general store in town. I do ask guys/gals to hang out when they seem like cool people, but most of the time I stay professional. This sometimes makes guys feel like it's okay to corner me and not take a hint because I kind of have to be courteous and polite (within reason obviously).
