Not trying to be a dick (i know how that sounds), but is their 'yellow fever' fetish 'inappropriate' simply because of the way it stereotypes the entire asian woman population, or because it rubs you the wrong way? There are a lot of fetishes that many people would consider 'awful' or strange. As far as I can tell, there isn't anything 'wrong' with their preference for docile asian women (not saying that is a reality, but perhaps an ideal). I mostly just lurk to keep up with what women are talking about these days, so any perspective helps. If both parties are into it, who can decide what is right or wrong? 

I'm not really attracted to one race more than another, so I hope I'm not coming off as some kind of weirdo, just on a quest for knowledge into the perspective of a woman.
