This might be asking too much information but what is your age range? It may be helpful to look at your age and genetics/ slow down before you make any hasty changes. My cup went up a few sizes due to weight gain + hormone changes in my 20's, my mother went through the same thing. The odd thing is in our family the girls stay large even after losing weight from childbirth or other things. Birth control is also a factor-- I gain a cup when I'm on it. My cycle also impacts size, pre-period is stretching out my smaller bras. This is anecdotal but I swear they are larger when I cook with coconut oil a lot.
