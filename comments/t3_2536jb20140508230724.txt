Weird how? [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_seizure) is the wikipedia page for partial seizures, just in case. It took me at least a year to Google the symptoms because I thought it was just a stress thing (it always happened while I was hard at work). You'd definitely know it was happening, though, it'd be a contained event. Or you'd lose consciousness and then you'd definitely know. I don't want to scare you away from wellbutrin - I'd go back on it if I could, I've even weighed it in my head, like "how bad is it *really* having little seizures?" because it did so much good for me. It's just a side effect that doesn't often get mentioned.
