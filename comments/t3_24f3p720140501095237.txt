I don't take my friends for granted. Even though I chose my old boyfriend over him I still gave him all my time. I spent 4-5 hours on Alex everyday. 

Trust me I know I'm a bitch for hurting him like that. But what would you have done? Either you chose to date the guy and not feel love for him and hurt him, or you can go out with a guy you like and hurt him?
