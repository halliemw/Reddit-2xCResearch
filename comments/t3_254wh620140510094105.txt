>Why not make a brand new subreddit that exists for exactly that purpose, 

Well, because it wouldn't work, obviously - you need a huge userbase and a strong community for something like this to have any effect.  This always meant that, *if* we were ever going to educate the rest of Reddit with a new default, then a strong, high-quality sub would have to be sacrificed to do it.  

Whether or not you think the outcome is worth that price is a legitimate area for debate, but we shouldn't pretend there was a painless and obvious alternative way to accomplish the same goal.
