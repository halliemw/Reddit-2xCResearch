My mom sort of was? My dad was a hardcore alcoholic and they were never married. Mom knew she wanted a baby and as far as I know, my dad wasn't *not* okay with it. 

After I was born, my mom lived in a shitty trailer in the not-very-nice parts of Atlanta. My dad was in and out of jobs and spending his money on booze and drugs. My mom lived with his mom while she worked constantly. My dad's mom was also an alcoholic and as I understand her house was fucking disgusting. Mom wouldn't even let me on the floor there. She wasn't there long. My mom's aunt and my mom rented a house when I was 4. My aunt watched me while my mom worked 2 jobs. My aunt was a teacher, so she was also bringing in money. My mom was a bitch during that time; if she wasn't asleep she was at work. If I woke her up, she'd yell. I called her The Dragon Lady during that time. She thought it was funny. My dad was in and out of the picture. She told me that she didn't ask him for child support because she knew he would never pay it, but wanted me to at least know him. She also told me if she knew then what she knew now, she'd never tell him about me and just leave him.

 We lived there for 2 years before my mom and her dad bought (and had built) a house together. My grandparents, my mom, myself, my mom's aunt, my mom's brother (drug/money problems), and occasionally my dad all lived in this house. It was a nice house with plenty of room for all of us. 

My mom had a shit-ton of help raising me. 

I tried getting my mom to date, but as far as I know, she has little to know interest. I think she's scared. I still occasionally offer to make her an online profile. 

Slowly the years have claimed my grandfather, my dad, my uncle, and my aunt is in an assisted living home after she lost both legs ATK from diabetes. My mom and grandmother live in the big house with the basement rented out. I work a few stores away from her and stop to hang out pretty often.
