Talk to a therapist or doctor about your body image problems, because it does sound like your body image is getting pretty unhealthy. You also need to keep treating your depression. Have you tried any other meds since then? Wellbutrin is a mood stabilizer and is well known for having weight loss as a side effect. It's possible you'd do better to be on a different mood stabilizer or even an antidepressant that wouldn't make you lose weight. It won't fix your body image issues, but if you're struggling with depression that's only going to exacerbate the problem.
