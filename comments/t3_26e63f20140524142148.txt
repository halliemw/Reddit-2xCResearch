I played soccer in high school in a rural area, so sometimes our bus trips to other schools were an hour or so long. On one such trip, I got my period. When we got to the other school, I ran into their bathroom hoping they had a tampon machine. I pulled out a quarter, selected the tampon side and twisted the knob. Nothing happened. I was in a hurry, but also needy, so I figured I'd try the pad side quick. I put in another quarter and turned the knob. A pad tried to come out, but it was so big I had to reach my hand up in the machine and help it the rest of the way out.

What I had been dispensed was the largest pad I'd ever seen at the time. (Now that I've had a baby, I would say it was just about as large as a maternity pad.) Only when I opened this pad, there was no adhesive lining; it came with a packet of bobby pins. (And possibly the faint sound of banjos playing on the wind.)

I'm pretty sure I was the first person to use that machine in more than two decades. I hate those machines.
