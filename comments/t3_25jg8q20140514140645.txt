Well, I'm sorry about that, but it's not me...  I don't know if you caught it, but I included a smiley, thus implying I am *not* offended and was trying to be friendly.  I'm actually really glad it worked for you!  =)  

Remember that we're being invaded by a bunch of asshats right now, and try not to take it personally.  I'm getting downvoted on a lot of things and it's just what happens when we're opened up to droves of idiots.  =)
