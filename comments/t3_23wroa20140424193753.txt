Oh my god, that's terrible. Because, you know, no matter what you say, you just feed into their suspicions, right? If you argue with them, you're just demonstrating how deep in the closet you are. I've gotten that from the other side, sort of, with people insisting that I'm actually straight. Super frustrating, because it's like, there's nothing so dreadful about being straight, but I'm not! So I guess I get that, even though my first instinct was kind of "what's so bad about being seen as gay?", and that might still be something worth thinking about. 

It sounds like it's not currently a problem that's really out in the open, so in your position, I think I'd just hope it never comes up again? Maybe in the future, if you get a boyfriend, they'll realize they were wrong. Of course, they could also take that as a sign that you're trying to cover for how deep in the closet you are, but I mean, it could go either way. I still think that's your best bet.
