Clothes and shoes you can run in. Walk straight and with purpose. Things you can have at hand that are not illegal but may be jsed as weapons:hair spray, glas nail file, knitting needles, pens... Might be worth doing a self-defence course to get used to some easy moves to protect your self. When walking home, you could have a friend on phone so that if something happens he/she can call the police to you. Talk as if you are about to meet up, like mention street you are on (so she/he knows where to call cops AND so that a possible attacker knows you know where you are, may be meeting up with someone and that that someone knows where you are - boom, no longer an ideal opportunity!).

If you can, move.
