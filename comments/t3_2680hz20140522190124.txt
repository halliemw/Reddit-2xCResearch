This was a very respectful, thoughtful, (and rational) response to OP's post. 

To OP: one day your looks will fade and you'll reminisce about the days when you were young and beautiful. Don't take what you have for granted and be upset that people appreciate your beauty. I'm sure you're a nice woman as well and I don't doubt your intellect or status. Don't be upset when people don't have the time to learn about who you are as a person in that moment and would like to learn about you by asking you out on a date (where that sort of stuff happens).
