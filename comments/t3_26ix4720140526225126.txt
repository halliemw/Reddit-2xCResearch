Yeah cheating is dumb. I just felt like I needed to admit I'd even thought about it, which I had obviously. Saying it out loud (via the internet) helped get it off my chest and now that it's out there that's not really the outcome I want and certainly won't help anything. Just weird to even find yourself in a place where that seems like a good idea.
