Where are the stickie posts (other than the uninformative, and vaguely condescending rules reminder)? Polls? Some organized way of reaching out to the community with an explanation and opportunity for feedback, rather than the cluster-fuck that went down today.

And again, I don't want vague "we're listening and will do what's best" reassurance. The way this was handled removed any trust I had in the mod team, so at this point offer specifics not vague reassurances. Because the reassurances only mean something if there's a degree of trust there.
