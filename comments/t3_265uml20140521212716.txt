Really? The worst advice you have ever read is that honesty in a marriage is important? If she values her relationship with her husband, one where there is trust and honesty, then she should tell him. If what she values is simply preserving the appearance of the marriage then she can hide it. You also don't take into account the fact that there is a huge possibility of him finding out on his own. It would be a lot harder to salvage a relationship after actually going through with something that morally offensive to him and lying about it. There is more to a marriage than just "being married" there is an actual relationship, and partnership involved. The marriage will eventually crumble without a foundation of trust.  
So please enlighten me as to how deception has enriched your relationships?
