see a counselor and also a suggestion.

I've been in a similar situation, and I found it helpful to have a mantra, a little focusing phrase that helps me not go into my panic/assumption mode.

example:BF is not EXBF, and he is not doing what EXBF did he is safe because of X.

This is a thought process and it takes awareness and commitment.
