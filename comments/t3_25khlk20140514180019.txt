Thanks for sharing! I thought it was a really interesting take on transition and one I haven't heard before. Glad to hear you're feeling more grounded in yourself. 

Also, sorry you're entering the world of being talked over or running the risk of being seen as "loud" or "bitchy" if you don't wanna be talked over. Pull up a seat and have a drink ;)
