Wait. How old are you and the guys? Because it sounded like you're a university student, college at least, but this kind of behaviour seems so childish I don't even understand... I'm also studying with mostly guys (computer science) but we are *grown ups* and even if some kind of idiot did something like this the rest would just think less of him and make him fill like an idiot... I mean, my guys are far from perfect but they have some decency and they're not children anymore.
