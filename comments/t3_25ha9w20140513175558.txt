Chances aren't really that slim. So many people have HPV that even with only one other PIV partner, your partner still could have it, especially if she had any other partners before him. So the question is not so much do you trust him, but do you trust his ex to have had no partners before? Even for oral or manual sex, because while it's rare, transmission can occur that way. Also, if he didn't get screened for STIs before you started having sex, you should have an STI screening anyway, and a Pap is like an extra 2 seconds if you're in for that so just get it all out of the way.
