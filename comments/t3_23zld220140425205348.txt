I'm attending Caltech starting next year, so this really caught my interest. I'll have to find a copy of her book to read this summer! I'm especially interested in the different methods and justification by which the three schools (MIT, Georgia Tech, and Caltech) became coed. 

One thing that stood out about Caltech versus the other schools (which I got into, but decided not to attend) was that although there are more males than females, it never felt that way at all. I chalk it up to most of the women there being incredibly outgoing and personable, which I guess made the proportions seem different.
