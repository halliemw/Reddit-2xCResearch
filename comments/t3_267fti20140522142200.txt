I think it's still sexist because in most those cases, the level of modesty is much stricter for women. 

Even in many Islamic countries there is some dress code for men, but it's not enforced as heavily typically, and it allows much more skin to be revealed than for women.

It's kind of like if you said you had to cut salaries for everyone in the office, but were cutting it 20% more for all female employees over male employees, even for those doing the same job.
