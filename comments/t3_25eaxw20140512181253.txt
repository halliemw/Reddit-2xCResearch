There is no easy choice in an unplanned pregnancy, only making the best choice you can with the information you have.  Just from reading your post it seems like there has been a significant lack of compassion and acknowledgement coming your way.  

I don't know exactly what it's like to be in your position, but I do know the stress, pain, and loss that stem from an unexpected pregnancy like yours.  I also know the pain of losing a very much wanted pregnancy, which sounds like yours too.  

I was lucky enough to have gentle people to treat me with empathy and kindness, where you have not been.  If there is any grief counseling available to you it may be beneficial to seek it out.  The only other things I can say are I am here for you via PM if you want/need to talk, and I am so sorry for your loss.
