You're very welcome. Given the levels of pain women routinely report from IUD insertion, I've always thought the typical "Oh, just take an ibuprofen right beforehand" medical advice was bullshit. Why should we be expected to suck it up and suffer when there's a trivial, cheap, safe drug regimen that makes it easier?
