Maybe because they aren't? 

Let me put it this way, I do research and have a degree in math. Most of these papers horrify me by how bad and disingenuous they are.  

I have a sister, a mother, a girlfriend and all sorts of other women in my life that I want safe. I simply have absolutely nothing to gain by downplaying sexual assault.  

The authors of these papers are 'professional feminists', whose sole job is to publish papers that feminists care for and argue for more rights for women. I'd argue they have plenty more reason to be biased.
