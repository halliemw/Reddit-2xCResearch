Holy shit, good job! Remember that a lot of your ridiculous upcoming struggles are something that is totally normal. Breaking down and crying over a clogged toilet? It happens. Spilling boiling water everywhere because you tried to cook pasta? Hilariously average.

I dunno, I tend to take comfort in the fact that "normal" doesn't mean "perfect". It may not be how it works for you, but if you take comfort in that kind of thing - remember that everyone runs out of toilet paper once.
