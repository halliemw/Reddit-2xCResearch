When someone is asking for advice on what to do, waxing philisophical about what would be considered rape in some other situation for someone else- i.e., a man, as you said--has nothing to do with what she asked and does nothing to help. 

>I don't see how telling a woman she was raped helps her

Check through my history and note that I never told her she was raped. Get your ass back to Mensrights. EDIT: Sorry, I see that your prefer the r/TheRedPill. Lovely.
