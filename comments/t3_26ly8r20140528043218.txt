The sad thing I've learned from living in a university town is that predators know where the college girls drink and sleep (and no kidding, its in a concentrated area) and they know they will a) be young and stupid/inexperienced and b) be intoxicated and c)think they are safe because they are on campus or close to home. In my downtown university, there have been 4 cases of assault where the perpetrators followed the girls home to their dorms and got away with no charges. Please be careful ladies!

EDIT: I don't mean to say stupid as a victim blaming thing. I mean it in the exact same way that I was stupid when I was 18...when I let a strange boy take me to the woods on campus and he too, assaulted me. I was young and invincible and drunk...and again...please be careful!
