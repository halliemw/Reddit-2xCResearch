I actually have an ongoing bad relationship with my stepmom. 

like I said, my problem with her stems from her not wanting me in her life. me and my sister, we come over for dinner and she makes it feel like we're intruding on her romantic candlelit evening with our dad. we talked about this being an issue in family counseling and nothing changed but that they stopped going to counseling anymore.

she talks over me, she doesn't listen when I tell her how I feel, she gets mad when I say anything that contradicts her opinions or that is critical of her "dreams". she doesn't understand my jokes, she finds my [communication style](http://www.amazon.com/Deborah-Tannen/e/B000AQ3YWU) inherently rude where I find her's ponderous and windbaggy. 

what I want is to be treated with respect. like if I had an opinion or an idea it would be listened too, and if a contrary thing were to happen I would get a reasonable explanation as to why.

what I get is a woman who asks me if I really *need* that burrito? humm? like it's a helpful observation.
 
if you want your stepdaughter in your life, you're miles ahead of mine just with that. 

may I recommend [Spy Alley](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1986/spy-alley) for your next boardgame night?
