>I knew a dozen girls in high school who dated guys in their 20s and I feel like most girls tend to be more attracted to 30-year-old than 17-year-old celebrity.

More often than not, these sorts of relationships are predatory. Not saying a legit healthy relationship is *impossible* between, say a 15 year old and a 22 year old or something... But generally speaking, what would anyone in their 20's see as attractive in a high schooler, apart from easy manipulation?

How old are you, by the way? When I was a high schooler, I didn't see it as quite so creepy. Now I get it, though.
