Your problem is that the well meaning advice you give to prevent rape?

It doesn't work. It never worked. A rapist isn't going after the woman with the confidence to attract all eyes on her. He's or she's looking for someone afraid of being blamed. Someone they can talk to alone, and test their boundaries. Someone who will keep it all a secret, and let it rip them apart inside. 

The kind of woman who is asking herself, what she could have done to prevent it all.

So no, your advice isn't welcome.
