This was interesting I am starting my first donation cycle now and my experience is slightly different. 

After the initial application and in-person interview, I was asked to get two things done on my own(as far as scheduling). I have an IUD and they original took blood to get my AMH levels and sent me to a psychologist who had to give the ok. He asked a lot of questions about my opinions on donation. Why I was doing it, my history of mental illness, and my feelings on infertility.

I am doing a special program that provides low cost embryos to couples so I am not chosen by one couple, I am matched with several couples by the clinic. I was given estrogen oral BC to regulate my period. My next step is "official" injection training. I was given informal training during my initial interview (where they give all the details of what donation involves and my options for donating like the low cost program or "normal" donation).

I get an initial ultrasound before injections start and some FDA lab work.  next I go off estrogen and start injections for three weeks. No sex during that time as I get SUPER fertile apparently. then two more ultrasounds and retrieval.

I had to provide family medical history in my initial application and have never given pictures of anyone but myself. Honestly that would be a dealbreaker if I was asked to. I think it would be a loss of privacy to my family. I also never gave their names, just a list of medical issues.
