Thanks - I've thought about that, and I used it a lot in undergrad! The problem is that he only teaches VERY small graduate courses (3-10 people per class) and I know for a fact that he wouldn't see the rating... he isn't very active with technology. I sort of want him to know my feelings about his comments, but I am just not sure if it's worth the confrontation considering we work in really close proximity.
