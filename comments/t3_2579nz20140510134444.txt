It was clearly hyperbole, I don't see the need to split hairs. Threats of suicide are very common in abusive relationships, especially ones involving teengers. There have probably been thousands if not millions of pamphlets made since relationship abuse started to become a thing to make pamphlets about, picking a random two off Google to split hairs seems silly to me. Are you suggesting threats of suicide are *not* common in abusive relationships?
