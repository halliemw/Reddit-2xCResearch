Yep. 45 seconds of blindingly intense, new level, formative pain. I don't really know how I kept my legs apart, but when it was over, it was over. 10 minutes of REALLY BAD cramps, an hour of BAD cramps, 5 hours of bad period cramps, woke up the next day cramp free and happy to not think about birth control for 5 years.

Totally learn about lamaze breathing, try to relax your body and let the pain flow through you and out of you (not stopping to settle in a tensed muscle) ... do anything to clear your mind completely blank or occupy it with something like the ABC's or counting back from 100 while fully visualizing each digit or letter.  When you're in extreme pain your body produces some mad endorphins to help you forget all about the incident (and they kinda help with the pain a bit, too). I find that clearing my mind makes the event less significant, and therefore less traumatic.
