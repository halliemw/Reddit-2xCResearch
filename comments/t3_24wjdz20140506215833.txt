I'm glad someone noticed my "I feel" statements and attempts at a solution =), I've really been trying hard to make sure I approach the conversation the right way; i.e. as a problem with a possible solution, which is really what I want.

Well I mean if you have advice on what to do, I would take that as well. I'm getting to the end of my rope and any advice (especially on how to deal with the living together situation- both our names are on the lease and we pretty much have only shared property by now) is greatly appreciated.

It just feels like he's only out to win for him, if that makes sense. Like he doesn't realize we can both win. When I tell him I'm upset by something, like how he gropes me *all the time* and I specifically said to him "please don't do X and Y during these times/at all and also do Z more" and he's just like "fine I just won't touch you at all then!" I have been slowly realizing (with the help of books on manipulation) how fucked up that line is; that he is trying to force me to accept something supremely uncomfortable in order to get a small tiny dose of what I want. That's not right and I want to learn how to not fall for that shit. So thank you so much for your help.
