Well for finding support and not being trolled or having some jerk get mad at you, I think that's probably dead. Mods will be deleting reported comments, so reporting anything hateful is good but mods can only delete so fast, so there's going to be a lot of posters who get the lovely chance to read their "You dirty slut/baby killer" comments.
