>If you value your marriage, you should tell him the truth

If she values staying married, she won't tell him she is considering an abortion. If her husband thinks birth control is immoral, he is a very conservative Catholic. Her husband literally believes that a fetus is morally equivalent to a baby. How would you feel if your husband told you he was thinking about killing your toddler? He might not divorce(because Catholics consider divorce immoral), but he is never going to trust or respect his wife again. He simply can't trust someone who wants to kill her own children(his view).

Now, if she would rather be divorced than live a lie, then she should tell him, but don't pretend her marriage will be better off. Her marriage will be over.

Edit: After thinking about it, this is arguably the worst advice I have seen on Reddit. Its rare for someone to innocent looking advice that will do so much damage.
