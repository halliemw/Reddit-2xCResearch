For your sake, I hope this works out. But, let's be honest, this is going to end poorly, isn't it? Like, train wreck poorly.

With my good friends (male and female), I have license to raise an eyebrow and say things like, "Are you *sure* this is a good idea?" and "So, what's the game plan here and how do you think that's going to work out?" Surely you two are good enough friends that you can express your concern without her blowing up at you?

Best of luck.
