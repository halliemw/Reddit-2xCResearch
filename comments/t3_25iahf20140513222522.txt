So let's say a friend and I get into a situation where sex is prominent. We both consent and have sex. Am I now committed to this guy? Wouldn't it be bad to just move on without a thought? I feel like sex should be something treasured, but at the same time I fear commitment! Commitment means I have to stick with one guy and feeling aroused towards anyone else wouldn't be good for the relationship. Is it in bad taste to have sex with a guy and just remain friends? Wouldn't that make me a nymph of sorts?
