Another young Mirena user chiming in! I had mine inserted last year at 20 and have never had children. My gynecologist just asked about relationship status (committed, exclusive, long-term, etc) and that was it.

Hurt a ton the first hour it was inserted but for 5 years with no pregnancy and no periods, it's sooooo worth it.
