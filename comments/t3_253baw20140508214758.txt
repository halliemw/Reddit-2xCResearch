I definitely think my birth control helps my symptoms. I'm hoping that if I do have endo it doesn't totally effect my life (severe pain, infertility, surgeries, etc). It seems like a more common disease, but not much is known about it. :/ Fingers crossed, I suppose. 
What kind of symptoms do you experience?
