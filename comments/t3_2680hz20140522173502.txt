humans have the ability to overcome their base instincts, otherwise there would be no suicide in human history. but they must work to overcome these instincts. you can approach and get to know someone who you find repulsive, you can overcome your repulsion to them. but it won't come naturally to you, you will have to put effort into it. you can continue doing this so many times that it becomes easy for you. and once you have done that your confirmation bias will be working in the favor of the idea that a book can't be judged by its cover. 

but now do the test on people who don't have practice with it. go dress up to be very ugly and approach children. see how they react to it. they are acting out of natural instincts, basic human nature. they haven't learned to overcome their human nature yet. 

and you can't escape confirmation bias unless you work out ways to come up with the truth outside of your own perception (this is why scientists use double blind studies). confirmation bias is a direct result of the simple FACT that you can only experience the world as you experience the world. nobody can escape this. it is logically impossible to escape from this. 

and last but not least, different people are attracted to different things. but the different things that males are primarily attracted to are all physical features. this isn't just true of humans, it is true of all mammals. there are strong evolutionary reasons for this that predate the race of humans. that doesn't mean you can't overcome it, just that it takes effort.
