I have a Mirena and I squat/deadlift/the whole 9 yards.  No problems whatsoever.  The IUD gets shoved up inside your uterus, unlike a tampon which is just inside your vagina.

I've heard some ladies describe it as the worst pain ever and I'm slightly suspicious of that, although I may be biased.  I've always had really nasty period cramps and back pain, and for me the insertion pain was like a 5 or 6.  Relatively uncomfortable, but not terrible.  You'll be crampy for at least a few hours afterwards, but it's really just like having bad period cramps.  If you don't normally get bad cramps, it may be a bit much for you to endure, but on the other hand, I think it is worth it for the fact that you will be getting years of awesome BC out of it!
