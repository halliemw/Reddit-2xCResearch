I'm an engineer/project manager.  While this is often true of really superficial decisions such as colour preferences and decorating decisions, contractors across the board don't want to talk technical stuff and money with women.

Occasionally my husband will tag along with me for meetings or when I have to check up on construction.  Contractors and technical salespeople will invariably address and even ask him to "explain to his wife" even though he has zero experience in the field (he's a programmer)

I recently finished an energy retrofit/renovation on my parents house.  I was in charge of all money and planning/technical decisions. Sub-contractors would avoid talking to me (their boss)  or my mom (their primary client and day-to-day contact) and constantly ask to speak to my dad (who works a 90% travel job, had no idea of the budget or even what was getting changed)
