It's actually even bigger an issue in the UK sadly. Also a large part of it is that there are *many* women moving here during or after their teens, when this procedure is typically done much younger than that. I agree with you in a way, but I am glad that there is a cliic dedicated to helping these women rather than ignoring it under the pretence that it isn't 'our country's problem' so to speak.
