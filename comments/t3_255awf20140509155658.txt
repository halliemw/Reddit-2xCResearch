I was trying to get around the "well give me your cell and I'll call you when you're off the clock" follow up question. I thought maybe if she said she cannot talk about anything personal at all (including giving her number out) then it may work - mostly because the type of guy who calls strange women sugar tits with 10 min of talking to her is likely one who doesn't take rejection well, so I figured not making it about rejecting him might help avoid any further comments. 

I'm a huge believer that women should be able to say "no thank you" and be left alone, but the truth is, any rejection will sometimes illicit worse behavior from the other side. I honestly don't know if the above will work, but it's worth a shot.
