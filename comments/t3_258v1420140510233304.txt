I was at my guy friend's house when we were 9 or 10 years old. I farted, and he stood there astounded, gaping at me. I muttered "excuse me" or something, to which he responded, "I didn't know that **girls** could fart *too0^oO*?!??" smh especially because he's lived with his mom and sister his whole life.
