I'm so sorry that happened to you. Often, people in a long distance thing will settle for someone close by as a proxy for the person they really want who is so far away. I understand this and I "get" it, so I think I might be able to forgive as long as distance isn't thrown back into the mix again (and it shouldn't be--I'm staying there indefinitely). 

I'm not opposed to getting back together with him but I don't even know if it's possible and, if it is, he has to do some serious apologizing and soul searching. But I adore him and likely always will.
