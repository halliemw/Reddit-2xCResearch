For what it is worth, in GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire, one of the point of view characters, Sansa, was similarly enchanted with the idea of a "charmed life." She lived for the idea of princes and princesses, dresses, romance, chivalry, beautiful babies, lemon cakes, etc. Her early predilection for such fantasy is barely explored in the show. The circumstances of the novel force her to come to terms with the realities of life fairly abruptly. Her character arc is one of my favorites because the loss of innocence is so staggeringly complete. I think she will emerge as one of the strongest characters in the novels.
