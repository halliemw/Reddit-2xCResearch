Some people are just selfish.  They grow up around lax parents, and they date people who put up with their shit, and they have forgiving friends, so .... they just never learn how to behave. 

The only advice I've learned in dealing with these people is to draw strict boundaries.  If you are scheduled to do something at 8:00, and she's not there by like 8:15, just leave without her.  She can't be mad at you for that, and she'll shape up next time.  Also, don't make plans where you have to rely on her.
