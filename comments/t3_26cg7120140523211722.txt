Go on you for reporting it. Hold the kid accountable. It's important; shit like this isn't okay. I'm all for compassion for the mentally disabled, but this crosses a lot of lines. If he gets away with this, it sends a message that the mentally disabled do not follow the same rules as the rest of us. 

Please update with the school's response, OP. 

> In this situation, I just froze. I was in a blind panic. It was like my brain was begging my body to do something other than just sit there, but I just couldn't.

Also going to add that you shouldn't blame yourself. You sound angry at yourself here. Don't be. Just saying.
