You should definitely look for a different gyno. I am 20, never had children, and not even in a ltr and my gyno even suggested a non-hormonal IUD to me. I actually had mine placed a few weeks ago and everything. The only problem was that since I haven't had children they had to slightly reposition my cervix (OW!) and there is a risk of my uterus trying to expel the IUD. There is absolutely no reason why your gyno should deny you an IUD!
