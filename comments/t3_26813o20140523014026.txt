Not Game of Thrones related, but I've always got annoyed in movies and TV shows when two characters have finished having sex, and then the guy sneakily puts his undies on and the girl sits in bed, pulling the sheets to cover up everything.  I mean christ you two, you just witnessed each other's bodies in the most intimate way, let it hang out a little.  I know when I get out of bed, whether I've just had sex or not, my dingus is going to be flapping around, happy as Larry.  Who am I hiding it from?

There's an episode of Sex and the City in which Carrie and Samantha visit Aiden's shack some ways out of NYC.  Samantha meets a sexy farmer and screws him in his barn. Both of them are butt naked, she's riding him and holding her boobs so no one can see.  If I was sexy farmer I'd be all "who are you... is somebody watching us? What are you doing?"

It's as annoying as when characters don't close doors - what are you doing? You'll let the heat out!
