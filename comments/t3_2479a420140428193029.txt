The problem is that in participating this way, they are usually at the second stage of recognizing sexism (per the article):

>Sexism happens, but the effect of “reverse sexism” on men is as bad or worse

So in responding in a way that says "but men suffer too!" it diminishes the issue by turning it into a pissing contest over who really suffers more from the instance of sexism rather than addressing how the sexism is bad for everyone. Also, sometimes articles are just about how women are effected and *that's okay*. We can have articles focusing on one perspective at a time and articles that focus on all perspectives. Not everything has to always be from all sides, is my point.
