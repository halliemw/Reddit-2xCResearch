I went from the pill (lo-estrin 24) to Nuvaring, to Mirena. I hated the pill. I never remembered to take it, I spotted constantly, I had migraines everyday and was almost always nauseous. It made me depressed, moody, and just all around not myself. I switched to Nuvaring, which I was on for 4 years and absolutely loved it. I could continually skip my periods for like 9 months at a time without any spotting, I didn't have to remember to take it, and I didn't notice any side effects. I just got Mirena yesterday, but I would have kept using Nuvaring if my insurance wasn't getting cancelled. With Mirena, I do love the idea of having continuous birth control for 5 years, so I wasn't terribly upset to switch.
