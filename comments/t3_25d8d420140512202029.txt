This makes me so freakin happy. I'm a natural A cup and absolutely hate them. I'm not saying seeing someone smaller makes me feel better, but the fact that she's so damn happy with the size I have makes ME happy. Happy to have what I have. I also really like this procedure..is this done in America? Anyone have any info on this type of procedure?
