No, its not hard for men to understand.  My dad, my husband, and many of my friends would never kiss or spank a female colleague.  Your company is being completely weird looking for a "reason" as to why this isn't OK.  Are they serious?  

"Generally, people like to have charge over their own body.  Other people's touches, kisses, slaps, pinches and pokes are not workplace appropriate because we are here to do our job, and are expected to maintain a level of professionalism that gives each person autonomy and the freedom to know they won't be touched in any unwanted way not associated with the job.  In the workplace, there is a general understanding that familiar touching needs to be strictly accompanied with verbal permission, and even then may not be appropriate.  Handshakes and hugs are appropriate situationally, but pokes, pinches and rear end slaps are not appropriate because they are childlike and quasi-sexual behavior. An employee working in a professional environment needs to understand that their desire to touch someone else, even in a playful or joking way, does not trump that person's desire to remain untouched. This is the same for men as it is for women and it should be upheld by our company."

Or something like that.  Essentially, the touching this guy is doing is childlike, even when it isn't sexual.  And childlike behavior is weird in a professional environment and honestly has no place there.  Handshakes are cool.  An occasional hug, why not? But those are touching behaviors that adult engage in.
