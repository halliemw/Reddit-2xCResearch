You completely dodged my question. Let's say my idea is terrible (again, you are basically declaring this to be the case, not really supporting it, but let's make the assumption). **How does this justify aggressiveness???**

Regarding "no one cares" - then why comment on it? I have been in this subreddit for about two years now, almost always preclude my words with this (again, as a disclaimer, not due to some necessary relevance), and you are the second person in all of this time to attack my pointing this out. I mean, I agree, my gender doesn't make my words any more or less correct. Noone's does. But this subreddit is explicitly for women's perspectives, and mine is not a woman's perspective. I simply pointed this out (to inform whoever's reading my post), and you attacked me for pointing this out. Why?..
