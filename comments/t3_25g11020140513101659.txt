I don't find many people leaning away from the author willing to be convinced by evidence. I didn't read this as an attempt to sway people who are invested in white male privilege, I read it as a dissection of white male privilege. Even if it had been written in the most respectful of tones I suspect the pushback would be equally intense and the criticism would still include accusations of tone.

As I've had occasion to say countless times in the past decade, if the only criticism that can be levied against an argument is its tone then the problem isn't the argument. The problem is that people are biased against the argument in the first place.
