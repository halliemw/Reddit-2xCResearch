Thanks for the advice. I have a question. My boyfriend and I don't share many interests, besides our favourite television shows. He's very into sports and I'm into reading and reddit. On that ground, we don't have much to talk about. People say it shouldn't matter but I'd like to know what I can talk to him about if we don't share a lot of interests.
