I'm in the UK (so I got it on the NHS) but I've just had an iud fitted. I'm 21, only had 2 partners but I think it's the best choice for me. I have a high BMI so combined pills are a no-no and don't want hormonal BC cos I have depression. It's not the comfiest thing having an IUD put in but not as scary/bad as it sounds. Hope you find the right BC for you :-)
