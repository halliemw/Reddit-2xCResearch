Not sure how much coursework you have left, but in case it helps, course evals are not given to the professors until after the semester is completely over, precisely to avoid a situation in which a professor could dock a student if they figured out who it was. You were in no danger. I ripped my politics professor a new one this semester for exactly the same kinds of problems and more.

P.S. Report it to the department--either assistant chair or chair depending how small the department is. They'll help you from there. Edit: or the ombudsperson if your university is particularly large. Smaller universities might not have one.
