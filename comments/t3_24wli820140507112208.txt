That's my beef with them. They should have apologized, deleted it and moved on. They kept defending it, removed & banned people, asked them to be "positive" when to some, BM were the ones not being positive. This is one of the quickest ways to lose brand loyalty. And then they came back saying all of the BM team was behind this post which was even more facepalm as up to that point, those who had an issue with it thought it was just the social media team.
