Something sounds fishy there, though. As ridiculous as some university conduct boards are, it would be very surprising to me if Columbia found clear guilt in multiple sexual assault cases and left the perps on campus. The liability would be enormous. And why would they be hearing a sexual assault case anyway? They enforce the uni laws - they don't replace the criminal justice system.
