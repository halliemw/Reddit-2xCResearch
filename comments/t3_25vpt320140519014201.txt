One anecdote from my regimen--I stretch! Right before getting horizontal, and right after getting vertical in the morning. It's a great way to relax your muscles at night, and get them going in the morning. Though you might need to be gentler in the AM if you have low blood pressure and feel dizzy sitting up quickly.
