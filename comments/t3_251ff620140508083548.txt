I would be willing to give the mods the benefit of the doubt if it were not already painfully obvious that downvote brigading is occurring. From looking through the new queue, I've seen more downvotes on posts than I ever have on this subreddit.

Unless things even out over the next few days, the outlook looks dim. I really hope that it all works out for the better.
