I generally don't find the non physical situations scary or threatening, just infuriating and rude. There are so many social arenas for people to hook up that I honestly don't understand why some people think it's appropriate to do it in the airport, on the street, at the doctors, in the office etc. If I'm wandering around on my own, chances are I want to be on my own. I don't want to have to deal with someone coming on to me and the subsequent anger or confusion (in my experience the guys who begin with inappropriate come ons end in one of these) at being rejected. I think it stems from this idea that all women are just dying for male attention and should be grateful for any that they get. Mostly I just want to run my errands, go to work and get on with my life.
