If you are, then you know at 4 or 5 weeks and you have time to make a decision and to make appointments, either for prenatal care or for an abortion, and if you want an abortion, you have a month or more depending on the method to get money and plans together. The later you find out, the worse off you are no matter what you choose to do. And if you're not, which I'm nearly 100% sure you're not, then you have the relief of knowing you're not pregnant. Taking a test is a win-win situation for you.
