how can someone say that they are seeking equality if they aren't willing to view their beliefs from all perspectives? if you don't think a male perspective is important to view feminism, than that is fine. just don't claim you are trying to reach equality. because you are not. you are trying to reach superiority, and the male's perspective is valueless and only the female perspective matters. its not equality you are fighting for, its oppression of the males for female superiority. 

if your feminism was about equality, the male and female perspective of it would be equally important.
