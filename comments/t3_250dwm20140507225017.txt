Just got out of my relationship of 3 years a few days ago. Not nearly as long as you but I'm right there with you. Absolutely torn apart. Its sucks to have someone who is supposed to be your best friend lie and do such a hurtful thing :( you have my condolences.


 You'll get through this. Time really does a good job of healing you. 

Just be strong and focus on you. When you start to feel an episode of sadness (I've been crying off and on these past few days) just do something that relaxes you. (Like to paint or lay out in the sun) 

And when he tries to scratch at the door again (and he probabw will) STAND YOUR GROUND. HE messed up, not you.  The ball is in his court now. You just heal and focus on what you deserve and what is best for you.
