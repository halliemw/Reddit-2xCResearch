Yup. Had to giggle. "Advanced ionic power", eh? If someone can explain what that does that my round brush + hair dryer doesn't do, I'd be obliged.

EDIT: Well, I found my answer in the reviews. "I love this dryer/volumizer! I have fine, thin hair and only one arm, so fixing my hair has been difficult. This device is easy for me to use one-handed and gives great volume and shine to my thin, limp hair. I love it so much I am buying a second one for travel!"
