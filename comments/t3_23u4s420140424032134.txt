I know how you feel - I'm not employed and have been out of work longer than ever before. In my case I have experience in unusual environments that doesn't translate well to the industries where the jobs are now.  

I have a very large document with a compilation of all the behavioral questions I've found on the web, along with the ones I've been asked and didn't already have an answer for. I've found that writing out lots of answers helps me clarify where I can use the same answers for multiple questions. 

If I get asked something I don't have a ready answer for, I usually start by saying that it's a really good question, and it's the first time I've been asked that. That gives me a bit of time to work out whether I can tweak any of the answers I have prepped to fit that question.  

How have you gone with using your network to find opportunities?
