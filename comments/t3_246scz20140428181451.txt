> The Other Woman is about OTHER WOMEN IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN

Yes, because the people who made it chose to make it solely about that and literally nothing else. What I'm saying is they shouldn't have done that, they should have made it at least contain *something* else like the 40 year old virgin and road trip did. Its unfair that movies about women going after men often contain literally *nothing* other than women talking about men, when I'm struggling to think of any male centric films that only talk about women the entire film.
