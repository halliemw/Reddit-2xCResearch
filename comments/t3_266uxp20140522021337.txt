Thank you for the wishes of luck. I do love that person. I love her heart towards others, she is passionate about helping kids who the system has harmed and is working toward that goal of making the world a better place for those persons. I love her willingness to try new things, we love going exploring and find new food or things to do around us. I love her sense of humor she can make me laugh on most days. I love her sense of appreciation, she still stops to this day and smells the flowers around us while we are on walks. I love her mind and ability to discuss ideas, I enjoy the time we have discussing things that challenge us both. I love that we cook together. I love that dance around our apartments together. I love her courage that she has in working to face her struggles with BPD and Major Depressive Disorder. I love her empathy when she is talking with the hurting. I could go on for more paragraphs then I have time to write. I love her. I love this relationship. Though most of all I love her.
