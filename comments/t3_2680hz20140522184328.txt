Guy perspective here: Look, I think the mistake you're making is overgeneralizing. What's important to remember is that (being careful not to fall back on the "Not all men" meme) some guys are assholes. They were born assholes, they see no problem with being assholes, and will revel in their asshole-ery because they think that it's the key to any success they have achieved up until this point in life. 

This isn't a uniquely male trait. Some women are bitches with exactly the same logic. 

What's important to distinguish is to separate the guys who are clearly assholes (like the one who sexted you) from they guys who probably thought "Hey, she seems nice. And she's pretty. Maybe I can get to know her better?" 

As for being just friends with a guy...that one is a little more tricky. For guys, the "Friend zone" is an area of shame when hanging out with an attractive girl. We're conditioned to think you're a loser if you can't be anything more than friends. So most guys either won't accept that, or will go into the friend zone with the hopes of one day converting it into something more.
