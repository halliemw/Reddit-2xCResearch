I'm a man, and I want to see what's on this sub, which I guess is why I'm here.

I was able to say "I'm not subscribed to any defaults" until today, and I probably will again soon. Defaults are absolute shit and filled with unforgivable amounts of sexism, racism, and homophobia. I would be VERY surprised if this place wasn't overrun, and all involved forced to retreat somewhere more obscure.

Any suggestions?
