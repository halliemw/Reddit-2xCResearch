I have come to very much dislike the term "mansplaining", but it's stuck pretty well in my head now and I'm not sure what to substitute it with. Suggestions?

Generally it means someone "explaining" stuff to you that you already know, bonus points if it invalidates something you've already just said or was about to say, bonus points if you literally just said the same thing OR the exact opposite and they kept explaining it to you. Bonus points if they are speaking from a position of privilege.

Generally used to describe men either "explaining", or explaining *away*, the lived experiences of women, and white people explaining away the lived experience of POC (people of colour), etc.

My dad "mansplains" (ugh, I mean, "explains" with air quotes) whenever anyone asks him anything. It means he just expounds on a topic and gets upset if you say anything to interrupt him. Lecturing instead of teaching, that kind of thing - no interactions, just barging straight ahead. edit: that's just the only example of ""explaining"", or privilege-splaining, that I can think of. it happens to be from a dude is all.

I haven't personally had anyone ""explain"" my own experiences or expertise to me. I also don't hang out in subreddits where that typically happens. edit: just to say that I haven't had it happen to me. I am lucky. I have seen many people describe their own experiences of it happening.
