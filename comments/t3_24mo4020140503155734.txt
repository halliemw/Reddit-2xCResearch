I lived this life.  Twice my father did the hand in the air ready to strike thing and I stood up to him.  It took me until 31 to move out.  

Here's what I wish I did MUCH sooner:

* Go talk to a therapist - it will allow you to talk about how frustrated, angry, and scared you are without dumping it on your family.
* Stop trying to reason with your father.  It won't work.  
* Stop trying to talk sense into your mom, that won't work either.
* Spend as much time out of the house as you can.  The less you are around that, the better.
* Make a plan to move out on your own or with a roommate.  
* Tell your boyfriend.  If he loves you, he'll be there to support you.

I got to a point that I just stopped talking to my father.  Writing him out of my life was the best thing I ever did.  Don't put yourself in the middle of your parents, they are both adults and they can deal with things themselves.  The only time you should intervene is if injury is imminent.

Its a very tough situation.  But you need to do what's best for you.  Get out as soon as its financially feasible.  I guarantee you will feel better.
