I explain to guys that the inside of the vagina is as sensitive as the inside of their cheek. And, how does it feel when they accidentally scrape or bite the inside of their cheek? That is how a vagina can hurt. Chafing is like scraping the inside of your cheek, but down there.

Guys get VERY empathic and apologetic if you explain it this way. It's a "Ow. Wow, holy shit! I never thought of it that way!!!" moment.
