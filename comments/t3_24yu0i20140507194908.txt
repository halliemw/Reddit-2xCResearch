I'm going to be dealing with this in the future if I move to the states to be with my boyfriend next year. Really scary. 

How we've discussed handling it is communication. What does he need from mr so that he does not feel resentment and feels satisfaction. Applying fir X numbers of jobs? Doing Y around the house? Looking for ways to save money around the house? 

Good luck, OP!
