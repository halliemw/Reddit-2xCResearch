I think it really depends on the friends. I have friends who I have stayed close to, despite them getting married, buying houses, etc. And those who became distant the moment they got a ring on their finger. It sounds like a lot of your friends are the latter. I wouldn't give up on them completely. You guys are friends for a reason. But definitely branch out. It can be hard to meet new friends (for me) but it sounds like you're outgoing and friendly (despite describing yourself as shy), so I think you should be just fine. Good luck.
