Yes, I mean, the problem is that it was an incredibly apt word for that situation. I was like, YUP, that dude was mansplaining, that's what he was doing. I embrace this term! It's so apt!

and then it's like, wait, no, that was a thing yes but it's not a THING, it's incredibly alienating to use as a general term, so what do I do now?

It has echoes, for me, of ppl being all, feminism should change its name to equalism. Which I *don't* agree with. Why is that? Why do I think that is different? Interested in an analysis. I feel like my opinion here is justified but I can't put my finger on why. Maybe it's not. What do you think?
