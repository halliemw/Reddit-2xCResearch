Ok, you had "verbal permission" to make the one cake topper for the wedding. Do you also have "verbal permission" to sell those same toppers on your Etsy store? There's a difference between making a one-off item for an event and mass producing the same item for a profit.

Did you design Lady of the Moon yourself? I don't recognize her from anywhere. If it's your own design, you have talent. Why not just pursue that? You seem to have artistic skill. You could design your own things instead of profiting off of characters/items that other people created, and that way you wouldn't have to do this "Oh, copyright isn't important" thing.

Or maybe I should just start producing "Moon Ladies" and selling them for cheaper than you do. Since creative rights don't matter.

Edit: The paint job on that topper looks really nice. There's definitely artistic talent there. Don't limit yourself to cashing in on popular franchises. You can do better.
