No you absolutely shouldn't. Props to that girl for being so bright minded to do something like that. Feminist issues differ from country to country. Yes the ones mentioned in the article under "global" were awful, but then where were the issues from Japan and Austrailia being mentioned? Nope, all from troubled locations that are famed for being nightmares for humanity in general. 

The article came off as being incredibly petty and making the plight of American women seem trivial for absolutely no reason. It is not trivial to be treated like a potential murderer when you are pregnant. It is not trivial to have to rush across state borders in order to have an abortion. It is not trivial to be sexually harrassed in the work place.
