Well, I don't have a mentally challenged boy so we're in hypothetical land now...but I'll give it a shot.

If it were the situation as described, and he touched my wife (his mother) that way, I would just let her deal with it because she's probably be pretty used to it by now.  Though I doubt the guy would do it to his own mother, I could be wrong.

If it were my son, I wouldn't have let him be in that situation in the first place knowing his tendency to act inappropriately around ladies.  They would be notified of his issues ahead of time, someone would be there with him to supervise for his own safety as well as the safety of the other people using the facility.  

*If* he were my son, and in spite of all that he *still* went about touching lady parts inappropriately, and he was an "adult", *and* was as smart as the guy in the OP seems to be...yes.  He probably needs an adjustment.  Some way to understand that it is not okay to do this and there are consequences beyond "no pudding after dinner".  You go touching people, expect to get touched back.
