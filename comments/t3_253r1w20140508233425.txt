I'm so glad this worked out so well for you!

Just out of curiosity, are the cramps the only pain you've had? I always just kind of vaguely felt like having an abortion would be somewhat painful physically, but I can't really explain why. I almost feel like that's something they told us in sex ed, that abortions are painful.
