Yeah I'm afraid that is what I'm getting at and is really the root of my issue with abortion. (Cue the down votes.) Two consenting adults, who are aware of what it takes to have a baby, must take responsibility for their actions. I really can't see an excuse for this. Why should a potential child be extinguished (I chose my words carefully to avoid potential classic pitfalls), due to the errancy of the parents? 

"i'm sure if i had been more stern and strict i wouldn't be in this situation." "the one time we didn't he said he'd pull out, he didn't."

The fact that he didn't "pull out" doesn't negate your responsibility for insisting that he use a condom. A the old saying goes, it takes two to tango.
