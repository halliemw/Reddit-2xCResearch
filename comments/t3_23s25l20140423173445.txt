How can you blame me for being extremely confused after all of this. I was broken by the person I loved the most & thought would die for me. All he did was play with my heart and fuck with my head as much as he could, for his own personal gain. No matter how much love and time I put into him. 

We was always lying, manipulating and treating me like shit so yes, I am having trouble accepting the fact that he "cared" about me when he wouldn't stop beating me and causing me serious mental and physical damage. He went out of his way to make my life a living hell. Constantly yelling, hurting me, putting me down, doing things he knew would crush me, and making me cry for selfish power trips. He knew what he was doing. Thats not love. Despite how he treated me I still wanted him to be happy & the best for him. 

I just am finding it hard to believe you can love & care about someone while watching them cry and beg to be comforted, so you can feel better about yourself. How you can cheat on someone and not feel bad. Etc.. If I mattered at all to him, he wouldn't put me through as much as he did. Right? I never once hit him back or use self defense when I was being beaten because I loved him. Even though I had every right to, just saying.
