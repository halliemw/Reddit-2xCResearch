[The Word for World is Forest](http://www.amazon.com/Word-World-Forest-Ursula-Guin/dp/0765324644) fiction, but Ursula LeGuin is a national treasure so I could recommend almost anything by her 

[Dr Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Tatianas-Sex-Advice-Creation/dp/0805063323/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400706878&sr=1-1&keywords=Dr+Tatiana%27s+Sex+Advice+to+All+Creation) self explanatory and delightful.

[Our Bodies Ourselves](http://www.amazon.com/Our-Bodies-Ourselves-Book-Women/dp/0671221469/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400706923&sr=1-3&keywords=our+bodies+ourselves) I got to read my mother's old copy from the 70's, a classic user's guide to the female body, there is an updated version too.

[Digger](http://www.amazon.com/Digger-Complete-Omnibus-Ursula-Vernon/dp/1936689324/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400706970&sr=1-1&keywords=digger+omnibus) it's a comic book about a wombat.

[Veiled Sentiments by Lilia Abu-Lughod](http://www.amazon.com/Veiled-Sentiments-Poetry-Bedouin-Society/dp/0520224736/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400706996&sr=1-1&keywords=veiled+sentiments) it's an ethnography so there's a bit more science going on, I'd also recommend the works of [Margaret Mead](http://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Mead/e/B001H6GTPQ/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1400707021&sr=1-2-ent), she's a little dated but there's good stuff to be seen

[Miss Manner's Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior](http://www.amazon.com/Manners-Excruciatingly-Correct-Behavior-Freshly/dp/0393058743/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400707064&sr=1-1&keywords=Miss+Manner%27s+Guide+to+Excruciatingly+Correct+Behavior) the section on weddings has always cracked me up, the illustrations are charming, and who else is going to tell you how to manage any occasion with grace and aplomb?

[Onions in the Stew](http://www.amazon.com/Onions-Stew-Betty-MacDonald/dp/B0000CJ3M0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400707107&sr=1-1&keywords=onions+in+the+stew) the last of Betty MacDonald's best selling mid-century memoirs I also recommend the rest of them, you might have to track them down but she is excellent
