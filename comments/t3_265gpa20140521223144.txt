Definitely this. I'm subletting a place I found on Craigslist this summer and I actually had my parents check it out for me before signing anything (they're 2 hours away, while I'm 8+ hours away for school). If that's an option, parents or other adults you trust are a great resource who can give you an unbiased opinion on what you're getting yourself into. If that's not an option, absolutely bring someone along for tours. A second person can give their opinion and can assess safety, quality, etc.
