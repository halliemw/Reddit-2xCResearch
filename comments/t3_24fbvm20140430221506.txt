>how do I friendzone a coworker

First of all, "The Friendzone" IS NOT A THING.

Second of all, I'm absolutely certain your co-worker is aware that you have a serious boyfriend if you keep mentioning it. No further explanation necessary. I get that it can be difficult to navigate non-romantic waters as an adult; it gets a little weirder, especially with co-workers, but you don't need to be all like "Not sure if you're trying to sleep with me, but fyi, never gonna happen".

>"You are awesome, you make the days brighter and it's awesome getting to talk every day so thanks for always making time to"

That's not a flirtation. That is a genuine thank you for being a friend.
