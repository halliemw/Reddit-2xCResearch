My view is that the dominance of males and the rarity of females in physics is not the problem here, the major problem is that you and other females are not being treated as individuals but instead as stereotypical members of the female sex. In fact, anyone who doesn't understand that individuals vary and that some females will inevitably be scientific geniuses is themselves guilty of scientific ineptitude -- namely in psychology.

That being said, because you posted that NDT video I feel compelled to link you to this:

The environment for women in physics will not improve when there are more women in physics, it will improve when everyone agrees to treat everyone else as an individual with his or her own traits.
