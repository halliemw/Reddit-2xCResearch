I completely see your point and understand what you're trying to say. Basically, the issue that has come up is that the university was required to report the gang rape to the student body within 90 days of the incident under Title IX, which they didn't.

The problem is that it's been a year since it happened, and the school never told the student body. Now that the news is out, a lot of people are saying that they shouldn't have needed to tell us about the rape, because it might not even have occurred, which is a violation of Title IX. People are confusing "innocent until proven guilty" with "innocent pretty much no matter what".

The texts were basically a response to the fact that the university immediately notified us about the stabbing that occurred, but we're only finding out about the alleged rape over a year later, which is wrong on so many levels.
