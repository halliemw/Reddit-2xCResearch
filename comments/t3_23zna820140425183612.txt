Well, unfortunately, this is only part of the picture. The attrition rate for women engineers in our program is higher than for men. I've personally experienced being advised to switch to an easier major, and I heard women are more likely to get that sort of "advice," good grades or not (at the time I was ranked in the top tenth of the class), so there's still a lot of work to be done at this institution in terms of providing a good educational experience regardless of gender. The same can be said about race, but this is 2x.

I'm glad you had a great experience. I'm looking forward to grad school because my future institution is in a liberal area with very open-minded people. I've only had one person comment that I got in because of my gender (and he did his undergrad at my alma mater so that doesn't count.)
