To be fair, I'm 5'6" and curvy and I get some of the age thing happening, too. I'm 23 and have been asked if I'm driving yet. I think it's a face thing, so I've taken to dressing a little older to help a little bit with the whole looking young thing. My mom had to cut her waist-length hair to get a job, and then it was in this tiny little town in the middle of nowhere that paid its teachers basically nothing. At least they can't state that they're not hiring you because you're too short now.
