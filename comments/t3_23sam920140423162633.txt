Again, as I mentioned in my other comment, my knowledge lies with English law but I imagine there are similar arrangements in America. Essentially, there are a number of rights fathers have outside marriage  and that cohabiting couples have. For instance, a man who suspects he has fathered a child but was not married to the mother or named on the birth certificate can apply for a declarator which, if granted, gives him the same legal rights as the mother. Similarly if both mother and father agree that the father is the father and he is named on the certificate then he has the same rights as the mother. In terms of cohabiting couples, if you are to all outward appearances married (ie having a sexual relationship, paying bills together and living together) then you do in essence have all the same rights as a married couple. Again, this is english/scots law so it may be different but I imagine it is relatively similar.
