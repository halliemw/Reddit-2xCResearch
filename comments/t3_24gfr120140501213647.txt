> and that famous men NEVER commit violence against women.

I personally don't know anyone that actually believes this, (maybe I just don't hang out with enough bigots). I mean I would just like to know where you're getting this impression that the majority of men apparently believe that, "famous Men NEVER commit violence against women." 

Edit: okay, you never actually said a majority, I felt it was implied.
