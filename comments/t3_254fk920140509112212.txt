I agree with this. I was and still am a huge tomboy, but I LOVED Barbies. I'd sit for hours with my best friends and make up all these stories with them, devote shelves to their homes, incorporate non-Barbie toys in the stories as well and a whole bunch of other neat things. My favorite was the gymnast Barbie because her arms and legs could bend! I retired them around age 13 (turning 25 on Monday), but I was sure to keep them safely tucked away in the basement.
