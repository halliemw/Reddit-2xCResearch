I see the same issue - it seems like when guys take an interest in me, it's all about physical appearance/desire for sex, nothing to do with personality/interests. I was on a few dating apps for a while, and no matter how clearly I expressed that I wasn't there for hookups and wanted to talk with a guy before I'd meet up, I got peppered with late-night MEET ME NOW requests. 

Even the guys that did talk to me failed out - it was very clear they weren't actually trying to get to know me, just trying to figure out where the arbitrary meet-me conversation quota would be met. I'd mention an interest or hobby or life-goal and get some head-patting response or vague reply instead of an actual engaged back-and-forth convo. It was like,

>Dude: So what do you do for a living?

>Me: Well, [insert job description here]. I'm really passionate about my career, and am considering pursuing a second Masters to be eligible for a better leadership position in my company.

>Dude: That's cute. You're cute.

I ended up deleting all apps without meeting a single guy. If you're not interested in the whole package, don't expect me to be interested in yours.
