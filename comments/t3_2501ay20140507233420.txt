You sound shocked, and you acted like any shocked person has the right to act. I want to bring justice down on those people so badly, but when someone harasses me I act the same way, because I'm horrified, surprised, confused, and ashamed. And you know, you and me and everyone who is on the receiving end has a right to react this way. We may help society by showing no tolerance to harassers. But we have no obligation to. In some cases, fighting back can even put someone in more danger, so passivity could be a survival tactic. Victims/receivers are not the ones in the wrong. Its the harassers and assaulters who are always in the wrong. That guy should have never done that in the first place. So you do what you gotta do to feel better and be safe.
