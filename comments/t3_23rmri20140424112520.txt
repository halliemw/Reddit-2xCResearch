At the law firm I used to work for *everyone* was included in Admin. Professionals Day, including the attorneys and IT people.  I guess it is differently when *nearly* every staff member is an admin, but I think the idea was to recognize the the admins and for everyone to enjoy a nice lunch or happy hour together.
