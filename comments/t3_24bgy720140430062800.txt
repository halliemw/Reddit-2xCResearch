Yes it was sexist, but it was also sensible.

From the point of view of your employers taking a female to a strip-club is a *Massive* liability in regards to a sexual harassment claim. I'm not suggesting you'd file that claim, but from your point of view if you insisted on going, made it clear you were fine with it and *then* got sexually harassed your argument would look weaker because you'd given prior consent and the defendants would suggest that you had insisted on going along to make the allegation up.

So, the decision was likely made to legally protect both you and your employer from a potentially dangerous situation, it sucks, but it's the nature of the society we live in.
