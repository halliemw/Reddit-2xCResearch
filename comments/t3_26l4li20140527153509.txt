No one knows why Adam Lanza did what he did.  He is a big question mark.  There is nothing to sympathize with.

Elliot Rodger was fundamentally broken, as you say, and his isolation was his fault more than anyone else's.  

Still, he didn't choose to be born with such poor social skills and common sense.  He genuinely could not understand why women did not like him.  Although he was filled with hatred, I'm sure that evolved from his sadness and loneliness.

There are many people who are also lonely and confused about why no one will love them.  They can sympathize with that specific emotion.  That doesn't mean they can empathize with his hatred, or desire to kill women.
