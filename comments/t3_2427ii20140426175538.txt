Whiskey clit is a thing and is a completely different issue from his size.  Personally, I hate drunk or even slightly tipsy sex and strongly recommend against it.  Sure it lowers inhibitions, but if you can't do it completely sober it probably shouldn't be happening at all.  Half the fun of that first time and maybe even the next two or three times is the nerves and uncertainty and fumbling around and taking the time to get comfortable with one another and know each others' bodies and things that give pleasure.

However, alcohol impaired or sober does not change his size and I know this is an unpopular opinion, but it does kind of matter and makes a difference.  At least for some of us.  Fortunately there are many ways to have an orgasm that have little or nothing to do with penetration.  Try having him finger you inside and on your clit, go down on you, get on top and grind, have him tease you and stimulate other erogenous zones until you can't take it anymore, use toys (dildos, vibrators, wrap his dick up in a string of beads [seriously, this is awesome], whatever else might turn you on and get you off), then have him get off with penetration, a blow job, a hand job, or whatever turns him on.

Sex is not a performance or a competition and an orgasm isn't even necessarily the end goal (though it's very nice when that happens).  It's about establishing a connection with someone else and sharing pleasure.  It doesn't really matter how that happens, it just matters that it does.  There's a million ways to work around a very minor issue when you've found someone you genuinely connect with and feel comfortable enough to be that intimate with.
