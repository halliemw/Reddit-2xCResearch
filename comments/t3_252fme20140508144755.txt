I never post pictures on public online forums (as a high school teacher I am worried about students finding them) but even if I did before, I certainly wouldn't now.  Before you could expect compliments and support.  Now, you'd have to prepare for a fair number of cruelly critical and/or creepy comments.  You would have to be very brave to post pictures here now that we are default.  

Maybe I'm being pessimistic.  Let's see what happens tomorrow.
