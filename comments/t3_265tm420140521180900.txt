maybe he had a muscle cramp or something? idk, it's hard to say without actually seeing it. i agree with the other comment about contacting management, but if it happens again, don't be afraid to speak up. you don't have to yell "YO ARE YOU MASTURBATING?!?" to get your point across ;) go with a "hey, are you ok? i noticed you're sitting kind of weirdly". his reaction to you calling out his positioning should tell you what he's doing.

EDIT: also, is it possible he's autistic or intellectually disabled or something like that?
