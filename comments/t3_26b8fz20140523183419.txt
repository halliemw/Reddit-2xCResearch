Thank you for posting this. As a woman and a reddit user and not a 2X subscriber I can see both sides. I understand how the women in this sub viewed it as a safe haven and that most other casual users of reddit are sarcastic and argumentative and enjoy playing devils advocate which isn't what this subreddit is for. I do agree that it should be removed as a default, both for personal reasons (I REALLY don't enjoy seeing posts about period poo and gross baby stuff etc on my leisurely reddit browse. If I wanted that I could search for it) and for the reasons of well intentioned subscribers to this sub. They should have a place for support from other women without fear of ridicule.  

But let me add this because as a woman I've been compelled to comment on a few posts I have seen. The women in this thread that I have encountered seem to me to be cliquish and unwilling to accept any opinion that may differ from their own. I have gotten some pretty rude and heated responses for simply stating a different and polite viewpoint or trying to look at things from another perspective to help the OP without being mean or sarcastic.   

So, I think the women in this sub are their own worst enemies. The ones doing the things you've mentioned deserve each other and are better left to their private girls club where they can complain and shoo away pests with their mob mentality.  

This was the wrong sub to represent women on reddit and I'm fully behind dropping it from default.
