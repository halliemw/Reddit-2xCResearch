[The male gaze.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaze#The_.22male_gaze.22_in_feminist_theory) Oh wait, this is Reddit so there's apparently no such thing as patriarchy! Basically people are brainwashed to think that way and it's become 'the norm'. 

I think being aware that you do it helps and becoming aware of what causes you and others to think like that helps to stop you in your tracks while you're doing it. If you have children, don't turn in to your mother.
