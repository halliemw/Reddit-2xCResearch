I accidentally a word, I think (too much beer; it was meant to be "Can't *stand* it!). I do get them tweezed and I used to get them waxed, but I only started in the last five years, maybe? And I'm a wuss, and my skin turns a glowing red for the next 12 hours so I have to time it carefully!

I'm also super shortsighted so I can't tweeze my own eyebrows, I'd have to mash my face into the mirror to see what I'm doing, and then I wouldn't be able to see what I'm doing...
