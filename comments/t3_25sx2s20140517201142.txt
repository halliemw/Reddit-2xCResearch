Saying someone was slut shamed doesn't mean you are saying they were a slut and they were shamed for it. It means they were shamed for being a slut when in reality, they were shamed for other people being sexually attracted to them, something they probably can't and should never have to control.

Like, I've been called a slut for wearing a skirt - the same skirt that I wear to my office job at a bank. If it's appropriate for a bank, it's certainly appropriate for the street. That situation would be called "slut shaming" not because I am a slut, but because I've been identified as one for a behaviour (skirt-wearing) that isn't slutty at all. Forcing dress codes on teenage girls is slut shaming because it suggests that tank tops and leggings are "slutty", not because tank tops and leggings really are slutty. Dress codes shame girls for a sexuality that is projected onto them. There is nothing *inherently* sexual about a spaghetti strap or an exposed belly button.

I'd say that's what the phrase really means: shaming someone for being too sexual, when that sexuality is projected from the viewer onto them. Like that story about how a girl got sent home from prom because the dads were feeling too attracted to her. She was told she was dressed inappropriately. That doesn't mean she was dressed inappropriately - it means that her friends' fathers were having inappropriate feelings for her, and then projected that desire onto her as a way to rationalize and excuse their behaviours. "It's not my fault - you can't help but feel attracted to a slut." Slut shaming is a part of rape culture because it excuses inappropriate sexual actions by blaming them on, or projecting them onto, or in other words "slut shaming" the victim.
