> They could think that you're implying you'd be interested in them if you didn't currently have a boyfriend.

That's exactly the implication. The problem with being honest is that if you straight-up tell someone no, you are making a bet. You are betting that they are a mature person who can handle rejection, and not a big baby who is going to take it personally and start getting angry or violent. If you win the bet and the person is nice and rational, you get nothing. If you lose the bet and the person turns out to be Tantrum McCrazypants, you got yourself a problem. Due to the payout, it's a stupid fucking bet to make, no matter how cool it sounds when you're not actually in that situation.
