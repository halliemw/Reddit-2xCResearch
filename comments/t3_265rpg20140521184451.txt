yes, i told her about it and we're gonna go look for a pharmacy today. i will definitely get it sorted out before my boyfriend and i try anything, am certainly not going to risk transmitting it to him! i was just afraid to bring it up to my mum because i didn't want her to think it had anything to do with my activities with him...
