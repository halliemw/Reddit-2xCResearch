Body hair. Like, on my lower back I have super light, very thin, practically invisible little hairs that I was soooo ashamed of for some reason. Same thing on my arms.  I thought I looked like a monkey because women aren't supposed to have any other hair than on their head, right? So as a teen I shaved not only my armpits, vagina and legs but also my back and my arms. 

Also, anything that had to do with periods. I felt embarrased even asking my mom for pads. I panicked at the thought of someone somehow noticing it was the time of the month. I was so anxious about it it was ridiculous. Because my vagina should always be fuckable, right? That is its primary function, is it not? 

Also, of course, poop. Guys can say "I'm gonna take a shit" or joke about shit taking, but girls don't poop.

It's really and sad how much of my teen years were spent obsessively  shaving and feeling gross about how my body worked. And silly, and unnessesary, and stupid. 

TLDR: body hair-shame, period-shame, poo-shame.
