Wella is a great brand. JOICO also makes a whole line specially formulated for grey coverage. As a hairdresser and technical advisor this is great advice the previous poster reccomended. Just so you know grey can sometimes be tricky to cover. I have come across this a couple times in my career. Depending on the colour line the stylist uses you can also leave the colour on longer. (Up to 75 min) the longer it sits the deeper the deposit will be. I can almost guarantee that you dont sit with colour on for that long. All of the lift occurs during the first portion of a colour aplication then deposit happens afterwards. Dont blame your stylist make sure you go to him and tell him how you are feeling. You should be getting your colour done every 4 to 6 weeks. If your hair is growing  faster you can always go sooner. Give him the oppertunity to correct what is happening. Communication is key. I am sure that he wants you to be happy. Like I said some grey can be tricky. Good luck!
