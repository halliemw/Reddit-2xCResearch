An example might be a woman coming here to rant about street harassment. An inappropriate response would be to chime on how her outfit or body maybe have been a tempting target for her harasser. Or someone who says that she should be flattered when someone asks her to smile. The offender may have a perspective on the interaction but it is not the focus of that woman's thread.

The OP has an experience. This experience is how she perceives her world and her place in it. Telling her that her perception is inherently wrong is not OK.
