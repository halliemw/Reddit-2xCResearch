I did potentially show symptoms though. I'm basically in diagnostic limbo. And while I'm aware the majority of the population contracts it, most of these people contract benign, non-wart-causing strains. I would rather have one of the high risk strains that cause an abnormal pap than the wart causing strains, which are far more stigmatized.
