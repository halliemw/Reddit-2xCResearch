> Taking his comment about the whole Satan tempting him; I would conclude that he believes in heaven and hell and the corresponding afterlives. The way he's looking at it, at the end of your respective lives, you will be in hell as a non-believer and he will be in heaven. I would say that that alone, assuming his love for you, would cause a great deal of angst for him.

You are correct. 

I'm happy to go to church, but don't believe. I don't think that's enough. :(
