The dress code is clearly not the point of the post. 

>We aren't slaves to our evolutionary imperatives. 

Evolution doesn't have an imperative. It's simply that the environment naturally selects. If you're suggesting that our genetics don't influence a lot of things about us, including elements of sexual attraction, you're simply wrong. Are you suggesting that people choose their sexual orientation?

Asking people to control their sexual impulses is reasonable. Asking that they not have them is not.

I frankly don't buy the, "the boys are distracted" argument in favour of dress codes. It's simply a justification that institutions use because it sounds reasonable if you don't think about it much. That having been said, I'm not against dress codes.
