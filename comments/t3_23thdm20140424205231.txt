Give the guy a break. He doesn't sound malicious and his actions did not effect you ( like leaving to get the kayak while you were crying would have). He saw an excuse to get out of work and took it. As long as he is kind to you, I'd advise letting this drop. Focus your attention on your family instead of fighting you bf.
