I am a false rape statistic and I only realized it recently. 12 years ago I was riding around with two guys from a neighboring high school. I got blackout drunk from a couple shots of vodka (never happened to me - prior to or since) and I woke up on my lawn with signs of penetration.    
    
I went to the hospital the next day and had a rape kit done. The police came to get my report a few days later. They badgered me for hours about how "it was consensual, though, right? You don't really want to ruin the lives of these boys, do you?" I got scared and I stated it was consensual and it went away.    
    
I got an AOL IM from one of the guys thanking me for doing that. I seriously only came to the realization that that would be considered a false rape statistic last year.
