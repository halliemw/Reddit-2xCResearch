I would think OP would need to decide how important her clothing choice is to her. 

My appearance is a part of my personality. Every single piece of it. My hair, my clothing, earings, makeup, tattoos. If my partner doesn't like an aspect of that, then they don't like the WHOLE me. My husband prefers my hair longer but he isn't the one wearing it. I have to look at myself in the mirror every day and be happy with how I look. He knows that. He doesn't criticize and tell me I'd look better one way or how much hotter I would look with long hair. He tells me he loves me and that I'm beautiful no matter what. He shouldn't ever frame it "You'd be hotter if..." when there are so many other ways to go about it. 

OP could also compromise by dressing up for him in private so she doesn't have to go out in public in clothing she may be uncomfortable in.
