You just hit on what bothered me about that post. It wasn't the breasts, it wasn't the stretch marks, or the fact that she's got a few extra pounds on. Hell, she recently gave birth, of course she's going to have those things. 

What bothered me was the dismissive "Fuck your skinny smooth boring ass ideal of what life should be that you ripped out of some dumb ass teen cosmo.  My life is goddamn beautiful even if my belly is a wreck." 

That might be her life, and more power to her, but it's not mine, and mine is no less valid for the fact that I'll never go through childbirth.
