I had a similar problem (cycles varied between, like, 25 and 45 days entirely at random). Doctor said it was normal, but annoying (I was using pads for literally weeks at a time, just in case my period hit, because I had *no way* of knowing when it would arrive), so I went on the pill! That pretty much fixed everything. This was when I was 17, I think. Like, talk to your doctor to see if that would be okay for you, because that's honestly what I'd recommend. It is *so* convenient, and since it sounds like your periods are pretty terrible, you can even use the pill to skip them for months at a time! 

So, I'd ask about that.
