I try to be hair-positive, but it's hard. I haven't shaved my legs in...a month or so? I initially started growing it out with the goal of trying out a new diy waxing technique (I've never waxed before) but then I got lazy and for various reasons I just haven't gotten around to it. So now I've got majorly hairy legs (probably for the first time since I was 10) and literally every day I fight with myself over whether or not I'm going to break down and shave today. My fiance says that it doesn't matter to him one way or the other, and very obviously refuses to comment whenever I bring up my hairy legs. One of these days I'm going to get around to waxing or shaving, just so I can stop fighting myself.
