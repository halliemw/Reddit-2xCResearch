I dunno... I am totally supportive of people doing what makes them happy and/or makes sense, but if you're a teacher, I'd probably advise against it.  If this ever got out you'd essentially be blacklisted from teaching.  Of course it doesn't make sense and totally isn't fair, but we're talking about the court of public opinion with a jury of soccer moms and Gladys from church.  
  
I would say that now that you're out of a serious relationship it would be the perfect time to explore things.  I don't know, I want you to do what makes you happy but would feel bad about seeing yet another teacher pitchforked out of school due to "oh golly she had a naked picture turn up somewhere" or some crap like that.
