yeah sorry. i am well over 17 and can -- but i am very low income so i wanted to go to PP where it's only $10.

i had taken it because of a failed condom yesterday, then i believe  that my SO came in me during the night, so i called to see if i was still protected from yester day's or if i needed a new one. 

when i said 'i think my BF came in me' she said 'did you know' and i said 'no' and she said she had to report it. this isn't about BC/EC as much as reporting to the police.

BTW, i start BC next week (when i get limited insurance) -- the issue is the reporting of this to the police. she said she had to if i did not. nothing more, nothing less.
