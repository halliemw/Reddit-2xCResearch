My wife is similar in nature to you in this respect. She doesn't particularly like that my reaction to almost all confrontation and issues like this is pretty hostile and aggressive. I don't like to be fucked with, and I will not hesitate to let them know. (Bear in mind, that, having been raised by actually crazy people, my radar for real danger is pretty well calibrated, and in situations where I sense there could be an issue, I am not aggressive. 99.9995% of the time, people in cars aren't gonna just stop in the middle of the road and run after me.) My wife says, "But you don't know what they're capable of. Just put your head down and keep moving." And I always tell her, "I **refuse** to be bullied and be afraid. They need to know that they don't intimidate me. 

That's not to say my way is the best. It may not be. I'm just sharing my perspective. :)
