> he said that he wanted someone to talk to if everyone was going to be drinking

Does the drinking of people around him make him uncomfortable (if so, why)? I can totally understand his desire to have a non-drinker around if that's the case. Is this the only sort of instance, or is it that he wants her around for everything?

This isn't stuff you need to answer to me--it just might be a good starting point for you.
