> if I'd be more of an inconvenience than a help... do you have any advice on that point, i.e. whether a visiting brother would be a help or a hindrance to her?

Well, it's really first and foremost about what she wants- just ask! Some new moms are all about getting all the help they can get, others just want to focus on their new little family and can be very protective about who comes around (especially if you'd be staying at her house). Also, will she be breastfeeding? If so, will she be comfortable breastfeeding and having her boobs hanging out around you?

Beyond that, whether you'll be a help or hindrance will be about how many people are around, what you're willing and able to do without taking direction, what needs to be done, and your ability to take initiative. If that makes sense :)

Also, you can tell her how excited you are to meet the new little one and, if you have that type of relationship, throwing in something about "happy laboring" might be appropriate and illicit a chuckle :)
