Just FYI: You do not have to get over the weirdness that is pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood. It freaks me out as a 24 year old woman to think of having a baby growing inside me or forcefully removing itself from me. I am not, however, totally against motherhood. It's not for me now, and I don't want to be pregnant, but in the future, adopting *could* be a possibility.          
        
My point is really that YOU determine if you become a mom, AND you determine HOW you become a mom. You don't have to be a mom.
