No no,  the cultural expectation is that in these specific roles (which are feminine roles) be played by a woman, not a man, hence the humor (or anger in some cases) as the coping mechanism to the cognitive dissonance.

Also, just because a woman is portrayed sexually or acts sexually does not make her a "sex object".
