I highly doubt that the campus police are equipped to track this person down.  I'd either make my instagram private or just keep blocking the accounts until the person gets bored and quits.

You say that it's only been a few days.  Odds are the troll will give up fairly shortly so long as you don't respond to anything they post and instantly ban their accounts when they pop up.

EDIT: Why the hell is this being downvoted?  I don't understand TwoX sometimes.
