I agree with most of this, but you have the last point wrong. If she is drunk enough not to consent, ie, passed out, it's an automatic rape charge. The officer was likely trying to get a grasp on if he could officially make a charge of rape stick, because if she were passed out, he could have. It has nothing to do with him not believing her, and everything to do with asking a question objectively so as not to lead her to say anything, etc. If he had asked, "were you drunk enough so i could make sure this becomes aggravated rape?" It could have motivated an answer. Cops have to be very careful about how they phrase things.
