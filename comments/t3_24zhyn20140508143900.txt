Something that always inspired me about my father was his willingness to listen to me, even when I needed to express something he didn't understand. He fostered my ability to communicate healthily, and honestly, because I learned to not take shit from him I learned to not take shit from any man. He let me be who I wanted to be, and to feel unlimited is freeing.
