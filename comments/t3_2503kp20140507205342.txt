This is one of the things I learned from being married for 19 years.

The tough times? That is when a persons true nature reveals itself. Be it the house being on fire, a child with projectile vomiting at 2 in the morning, the death of a relative.

It is ok to be upset, but seriously, if 20 years ago my then boyfriend hadn't supported me when I found out I was pregnant, I would of been out of there.

But, we see things differently, emotions are at play.

In no way am I saying that the choice is easy, I am saying it is hard but will be a growth experience. If he can't stand with you, when you need him, do you need him?

PM if you want support, I also have a friend who is a nurse at PP, she is very helpful and supportive and so on.
