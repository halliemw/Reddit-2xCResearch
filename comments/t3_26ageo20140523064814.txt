As a woman who got interested in football (soccer) by playing Football Manager on PS1 all those years ago, this is awesome news. I've always thought being a football coach is an amazing, challenging job :) The only other prominent female coach in the men's game is Carolina Morace in 1999 so maybe this will inspire more women. I hope she'll succeed, and if she fails, it shouldn't make people less likely to give the job to other women who are qualified. Managers get sacked all the time, for all kinds of reasons and nobody blames their testosterone levels :) 

If you're interested in the sport, come join /r/soccer. With the World Cup coming up, it's an easy way to get into football. Or if you're more into the women's side, there's /r/WomensSoccer.
