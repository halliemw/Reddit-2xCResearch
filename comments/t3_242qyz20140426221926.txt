Another vote for the IUD here.  ParaGard is completely non-hormonal (yay!) but insertion is not fun, it may make PMS and bleeding worse than before (not always, but fairly likely), and it's not cheap if you're paying for it out of pocket.  On the other hand, it lasts for at least 10-12 years unless you have it removed and then conception is possible pretty much right away.
