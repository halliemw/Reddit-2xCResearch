> You don't have to be a feminist to work with feminists. 

I agree.

But yeah, it really is good to take that breath and stop before we judge people.  Furthermore, I think it's important to realize that just because someone doesn't understand and/or questions feminist theory, that doesn't mean they're inherently bad or dumb - I find that a lot of people assume that some others hate women just because they have some latent sexist views that they don't quite understand.

Also of course, you have to walk a fine line whenever you suggest that you "know better" than anyone else.
