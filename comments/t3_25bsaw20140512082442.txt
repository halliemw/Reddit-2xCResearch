I think, underlying the depression, is also a real desire to harm oneself. We are almost dual creatures, a concious, feeling entity, and a proactive, action based one. We judge ourselves, as if we were something apart, and more harshly that we judge others. Self loathing, the inability to forgive or love or like what we perceive "we" are, is most satisfyingly concluded with pain, and death. As a "recovered" suicidal depressive, I find that compassion for myself (not self pity, god knows) was a huge part of the healing. I am still almost paralyzed by self disappointment, but that is a cross to bear. oh, and you do not own the other part of yourself, it may well be as serious as murder to end this childlike homunculus that depends on your will...
