I would never ever want to work in the same office as my SO.
I love him to the moon and back but I would never want to work with him in a close setting like that.


And that's okay OP. You don't have to be around your SO 24/7 for the relationship to be working. Space is okay! Space is good!

Plus mixing work with your private life can get pretty messy.
