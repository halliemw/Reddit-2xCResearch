My concern with the depo shot is the going back in every three months. How down to the wire is it? Do you know? My gyno always books way out so I don't wanna have an accident because I couldn't get an appointment on time, ya know? 

It seems like the longer I'm on any given pill the more symptoms I have from it. Was it like that for you? Nothing bothers me when it's new to me. It's almost like it builds up too much in my system or something. 

I didn't take my pill last night and though I can't say I feel different, 
I am less bloated today, which is nice though possibly just coincidence.
