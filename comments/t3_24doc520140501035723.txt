The exact cause of PCOS is still unknown but we do know that it is due to an imbalance in two sex hormones: [LH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutenizing_hormone) and [FSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone) that normally regulate your menstrual cycle. In PCOS, we have LH being produced at a higher rate while FSH is being inhibited. This results in a build-up of androgens and an inability for your ovarian follicles (eggs) to be released and they eventually turn into cysts.  

**The increased androgens are most likely responsible for the acne.** Also you might see [hirsutism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism) (excessive hair growth) due to this.
