When he was in the hospital he was prescribed Paxil, which helped a great deal with the anxiety. Since then he has talked about starting therapy, but he has not done the follow through. This is really the issue, the follow through. Part of me thinks I should just make the appointments for him, but I don't want to be that kind of wife. 

I have thought about the counseling too. We are both fans of personal therapy, and I don't think relationship counseling would be out of left field. 

This is good advice...I am scared to act on it, but I would rather do it than spend the next several years avoiding reality.
