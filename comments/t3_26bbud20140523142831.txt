From my own experience of a situation that is in some ways similar (I was blackout drunk, but I still don't know who the guy was) I can tell empathise that this is a really, truly horrible situation to be in. 

If you feel safe to maybe try and contact the police, if only so they can advise you of their sexual assault specialists because when the police were called for me the officers who came for me were the one thing that made me feel better. This could be specific to the area I am in though being in a big city in England. 

If you don't want to report it to the police I recommend you try and cut ties with this guy and find someone you feel able to talk to, a lot of the time when I feel upset by what happened venting to someone about it really helped.

And if you don't have anyone you would feel comfortable with I'm available. Hope you're ok
