Hmm. It may be a [self-fulfilling prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) kind of problem. He knows it will be hard to go to college considering his family situation and just accepts it bitterly without trying. He sees you (and probably your friends as well) preparing to go to college and can't help feeling awful about it (well, that's my guess). 

Nevertheless, if he doesn't support you and you don't see yourself going further with the guy, end it.
