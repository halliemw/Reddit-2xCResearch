I wish I could tell you that this gets better, but I'm 29 and still get this. (I also, when I say it's unlikely I'll ever get married, get told that I'm young and that'll change. Except that I haven't dated anyone since I was 22 and that's unlikely to change, so I doubt marriage will happen, but I digress.)

Anyway, it's extremely patronizing and I sympathize, believe me.
