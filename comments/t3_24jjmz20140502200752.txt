Fellow Blue Jay? :)

That's basically been my whole issue with this. The university put so much effort into keep everyone updated about the stabbing incident and continues to actively pursue the assailants. I'm so upset that we're only finding out about this now. At least it seems like the school is intent on changing things, like the sexual violence policies, and isn't trying to deny what happened or defend their actions (for now, at least).
