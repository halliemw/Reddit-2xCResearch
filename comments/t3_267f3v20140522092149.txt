You may be seeing a faint line because your brain is convinced it is there. But if it is actually there, that is early pregnancy (the line gets darker once you pass 4 weeks). Do you have a women's health clinic near you? They can usually get you in before your Dr. and some offer a blood test that can detect pregnancy sooner than urine.
