This is probably going to be a conflicting decision on this sub, but if the father asks for an abortion and wants to support you with that decision, and you don't want one, do NOT force him to to be financially responsible for your child.  Remember, you have the decision over your own body, but just because you have the legal right to take his money from him, doesn't mean you should.
