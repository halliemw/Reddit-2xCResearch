Writing my MS thesis, applying to PhD programs soon. I question my abilities - whether I have the tenacity and creativity to reach high standing in my chosen field. And I question the end goal (academia? government? industry?). But no, I'm pretty set on the PhD come hell or high water.

Can you take a mini-vacation (like a weekend to a week away) and then reassess?
