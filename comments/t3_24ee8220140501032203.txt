This is so wonderful to read, thank you so much for sharing it with us! You've dragged yourself out of the deep, murky waters of two terrifying and chronic conditions, and now happily splashing in the puddles on the road to recovery :) For so long people with BPD were just written off, it's wonderful to hear from someone else who's managed to find their way through to the other side!

I'm a BPD sufferer myself and you're right, the scars will always be there, and it sometimes breaks my heart to think of the intensity with which i loathed and blamed myself for things, but it's also mind-blowing to acknowledge how far I've come to be able to just *be*.

Have all of my love, support and best wishes. I hope life carries on taking you to new and exciting places, and that you fulfil all of your goals. To be fair, with what you've already achieved already, everything else is a breeze :)
