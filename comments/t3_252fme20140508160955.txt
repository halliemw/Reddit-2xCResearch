Well...I used the power of deduction. A very close knit subreddit that is mostly female is upset that their sub was made "default" and they were worried about all of the "criticism" and " a lot of penis" pictures. It just seemed very obvious to me.....it's all good though. I unsubscribed from this sub already so once this thread dies I will never be part of another XX convo. I recieved so much hate-mail in the last hour and I didnt even say anything mildly offensive. Ignorant? Maybe...Offensive or mean spirited, no.
