I usually went through my insurance and word of mouth.       

Interview them.  Ask them  what type of counseling do you specialize in? What experience do you have with my types of issue?  What kind of outcomes have you received?  How long do you expect this to last?  How do you feel about medication? What percentage of your clients do you refer to doctors for prescriptions?  What are those outcomes like?  

Take care!
