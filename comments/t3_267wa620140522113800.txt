I definitely had Gaga in mind with this too! She's completely mastered this, in my opinion. She's open with her sexuality but not in an attention-seeking way. And yep, I think people hate on Miley so much because she's so open with her body and talking about sex, but why the hell is it ok for rappers to talk about how big their dick is all the time?!
