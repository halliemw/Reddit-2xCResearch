Let me run this idea past you - a pretty serious comic about the aftermath of a rape committed on a male character, possibly with similar characteristics to D. You could graphically depict the crime itself, then explore common outcomes -the shame, the lack of belief from police and so forth. Spin it as a PSA bringing attention to the fact that men can suffer from rape. See if you can't make him squirm.
