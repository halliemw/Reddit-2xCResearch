I like the softness of my womanly body compared to the more rugged nature of my husband's body. Because I am soft, I get all the extra cuddles from the kids. 

I really really like my boobs. They smell good, they are warm and soft, and comforting, and smushy. When I can't sleep and I am laying in bed, I can play with them. When my hands are cold, in the cleavage they go. 

Corsets. I adore being able to wear a gold old fashioned, sturdy shaping corset.
