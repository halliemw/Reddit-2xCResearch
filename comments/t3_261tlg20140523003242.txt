Easy. Tell them that you will only go as yourself. You are not there to pretend to be someone you're not, and if they can't handle it, they should be turning the attitude behind those demands towards themselves. I'm on the reverse end, where I refused to wear a two-piece for all of my life. If I decide to wear it, it will be because I want to. Not because I've been pressured to wear it. Because I am myself and I refuse to pretend otherwise.
