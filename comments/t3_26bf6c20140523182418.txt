Everyday sexism can be things that seem little or trivial but that can affect you nonetheless. 
A few examples of what I've encountered:
My (male) boss likes to talk to the guy in the next cubicle over, and lately he's been raving about this new furniture company that he found. He's especially surprised that the company is run by (gasp) a woman. All day long, I get to hear stuff like, "can you believe it? A woman runs the company!" As if a woman is incapable of doing this and this is a major achievement for her. 
I'm in a writers group. I write a lot of horror and the macabre. Every time we're talking about one of my stories, without fail, a guy will tell me that he's surprised that someone "so cute" or "so sweet" writes horror. In fact, a guy once introduced me to a friend and said, "and would you believe that this little cutie writes horror?" As if my physical appearance dictates what I should and should not write. There are a handful of guys in my group who write horror as well, but no one ever tells them how cute they are or how it's so weird that someone so cute would write horror.
Though it wasn't aimed directly at me, I was pretty ticked off when comic book writer Tony Harris ranted about female cosplayers on Facebook  a while back. He wrote a long rant that basically stated that attractive female cosplayers aren't real comics fans and that they're only doing it for attention. A lot of fanboys already share this bullshit view, but when an established member of the comics industry starts spouting it, he gives them validation and winds up enabling them to bully female cosplayers and fans. 
Those are just a few examples of sexism in my life.
