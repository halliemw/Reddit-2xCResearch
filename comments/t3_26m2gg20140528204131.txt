Yeah!  I broke up with a guy I dated for like 3 years, and she started crying.  At first I thought she was sad for me, but then it turned into "but I just want to plan a wedding for you!  How could you do this to me!" 

She tells me to go find a rich, successful (aka a doctor, so she says) man so I can be happy.  I asked her, well, what about a regular income-d guy who make me so so happy? She literally says she doesn't care. 

I see posts all the time on facebook and stuff that are like "I love my mom!  Repost if your mom is your best friend!" and it makes me feel crazy cause I have nothing like that.  I'm glad you shared your story too--it makes me feel less alone :)
