When my cousin got married, they rented a house for a few days and they used it for everything. The rehearsal dinner was there, the wedding party stayed in the rooms the night before the wedding, and for the actual ceremony everyone surrounded them (standing up, no chairs or anything) in the beautiful backyard. Once the ceremony was over, everyone went back to the house/back porch and we all ate, drank, and hung out together. It was very intimate and low stress and one of my favorite weddings I've ever been to. I think they even had the house rented for a few days after the wedding and stayed there for their honeymoon.
