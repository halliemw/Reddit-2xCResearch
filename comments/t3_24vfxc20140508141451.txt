Definitely nothing wrong with body hair!

Also I think it's really sweet that you're trying so hard to make him feel confident about his body hair, and I'd bet that a lot of that self-consciousness about it probably comes cultural pressure and what not. However, if he is uncomfortable with his body hair even with all the positive reenforcement and decides to get it waxed, please support his decision! Feeling comfortable in your body is important, no matter your gender.
