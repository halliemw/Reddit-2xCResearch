If you are miserable in your relationship then of course you should leave. Some people just aren't compatible! I know it's hard to leave somebody when you share a home/pets. I've been in the same situation - no huge issues with our relationship just a subtle feeling that it wasnt right for me all the time. The best thing to do in my case was to get away from the living situation, I actually moved to a different country for a year but maybe you could take a less drastic option and stay with family/friends for a while?
