He is seeing a therapist today. There are probably multiple things he'll need to work out, but what you're talking about sounds like a possibility. He did have a chronically sick mother growing up who ended up passing when he was 18, and his dad was very militant and distant, so I'm not sure if those have been affecting him or not. We'll see though. I'm very hopeful.
