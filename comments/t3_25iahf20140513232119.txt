Where do you think your guilt comes from? (e.g., Are you currently or were you ever part of a religion that preached sex as a sin? How did your parents talk with you about sex?) I think knowing that might be helpful for processing and dealing with your guilt. 

As far as "having fun" goes: never have sex because you feel like you should; have sex because you want to.

You sound like you probably shouldn't be "sleeping around" in the way that you're imagining it, at least until you come to some peace with your guilt. 

Sex itself is not a moral act. It's how you treat others and how they treat you before, during, and afterward that makes it either moral or immoral. Try to figure out what moral sex means for you (and not your parents, etc.), and then do that. 

Personally, I've slept around quite a bit, and done some pretty kinky stuff, mostly with friends who I still talk to. The only negative sexual experiences I've had have been with people I didn't know well, so after learning the hard way a couple times, I don't do that anymore.

Also, if you're in college, your school probably has a counseling center or something that can help you figure some of this out. If you're still having serious guilt issues related to sex after reading my awesome advice, you should probably go talk to them.
