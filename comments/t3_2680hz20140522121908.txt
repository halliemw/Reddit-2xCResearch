You know... a good chunk of threads in this sub really resemble some threads in that mra/redpill subs, the key difference is that in here the posts are usually a lot more subtle, and of course, in the opposite direction.

But they seem to convey the same underlining idea that "the other gender is just impossible"

I wonder if this is just casual irony or an inevitable outcome of opposing forces, like a metaphor of Newton's third law of motion
