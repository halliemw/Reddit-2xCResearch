Happy to explain. Although a lot of people who live here are Muslim (like, 85%) there are other religious faiths and followings. There's an entire section of Isfahan (a city in Iran) that's Christian and there's quite a few Atheists, or Agnostics. 

People just live here, like anywhere else. Although I couldn't get beer here, you could totally get booze. Black market, but dammit, booze! I've had my fair share of bathtub wine, and have tried all sorts of European vodkas and whiskies I never even heard of. Although it's SUPER expensive, because you know, black market. 

...still no pork though. I miss bacon.
