When I was 15 I was at a downtown street fair one night.  My friend and I decided to stop in at a book store.  This guy that was probably 10 years my senior asked me about my shoes.  He said that they're nice and wanted to buy a pair for his girlfriend.  I told him where I got them, but he wanted to know the brand.  Me being the nice and stupid person that I was, took off my shoe so that he could look at the label inside.  Then he touched my foot and massaged it and asked me how it felt. I grabbed my shoe from him and ran off to find my friend.  I'm 33 now and I still get creeped out when I think about it.  
tl;dr older foot-fetish creeper tricked me into taking off my shoe.
