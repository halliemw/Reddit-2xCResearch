Picked this up on a search, so sorry for lateness of response but this article gives very strong advice about what you can do about men who act like sexual predators: http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/

Men who chat shit about women are not doing it to impress women, they're doing it to impress you. They think you're just like they are, so tell them they're wrong. And you can do exactly the same whenever you see someone being sexist in any other way. Call them out on it. Silence is complicity, and sexists don't listen to women.
