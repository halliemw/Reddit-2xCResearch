It's important because it relates back to the larger social conversation. When speaking about group relations (such as between men and women, whites and blacks, rich and poor, etc) you must recognize that within each group pair, there is a privileged and a marginalized group. This is due to historical and social constraints. The individuals within the privileged group may not recognize their own privileges, and that unconscious ignorance is what we are trying to combat. Until there is a critical mass of privileged (group) individuals who understand this and work against it, there will still be a pervasive cultural problem. Is that what you mean?
