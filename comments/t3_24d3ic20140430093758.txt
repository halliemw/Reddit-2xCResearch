It's something that makes me hesitant about having kids. I want kids, but I don't want them born into the genetic crap chute I feel like I've been born into. 

If I have the BRCA mutation I doubt I'll have biological children. And even if I do, I likely won't be able to breast feed. Pretty much every treatment I've researched means either no babies or no feeding babies naturally, and that's been really rough for me to accept. My step sister is fostering kids, and my baby sister is pregnant, and so it's been on my mind a lot, that when I'm ready for kids I may not be able to have them on my terms.
