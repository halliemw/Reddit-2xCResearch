I have two half-sleeves, which end about an inch above the elbow.  I never have them visible in professional-wear, by wearing either three-quarter length sleeves, or long-sleeved cardigans.  I have never had any issues concealing my tattoos when necessary, because I was careful when getting them to ensure that I would be able to easily cover them.  My workplace doesn't have issues with visible tattoos but I prefer to keep them covered at work because I deal with a lot of walk-ins and like to focus on work instead of discussing my tattoos with every stranger.  When I worked in an office without face-to-face customer service, I did occasionally have my tattoos visible without any problems, however I would recommend covering them during interviews and until you have a good feel for the office environment.  It helps that every office I have ever worked in is constantly freezing, so everyone wears longer sleeves and cardigans throughout the year.

Half-sleeves are super easy to conceal when necessary, so I'm wondering if your husband is using that argument as an excuse for some other reason.
