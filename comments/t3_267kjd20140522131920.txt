That is a very outdated opinion regarding IUDs, and does not reflect a doctor who is keeping up with current literature regarding IUDs.  The current FDA-approved IUDs are extremely effective at preventing pregnancy and are approved for and indicated for use in nulliparious women (women who have not given birth previously).

If you do investigate IUDs further, be sure to go to a provider who has extensive experience in inserting IUDs.  The experience of the medical professional performing the insertion is strongly correlated with successful placement and lower risk of expulsion.
