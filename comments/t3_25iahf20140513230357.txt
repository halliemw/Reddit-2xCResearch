So you're in college so I'm guessing you're in your very early 20s. I think what's going on here that you're afraid of the intensity of your own sexuality. It's some powerful shit right?  And now that you're single, you know that nothing stopping you except you... &amp; you don't want that 'slut' stigma. 

There something you just have to parse for yourself, but personally I don't think there's anything wrong with being a slut. Most single people go through a slut phase at some point in their lives, and what that could look like will vary. Some folks who go through everything tissue, and others might just have one crazy affair with a FWB situation. Nothing is required, you don't have to go through a sex phase or do anything you don't feel like you need to do. If you only want to be in committed relationships to have sex, then so be it. Personally though, I'm a big fan of not having any regrets. Ask yourself if you don't act on these feelings, will you regret not having the experience/s. Life is short, and we shouldn't necessarily worry about other people's judgments. people are going to make judgments about you whether you do things or not do things. But you know yourself best. 

By the way if you looking for permission, I totally granted to you :) go have your flings! Just remember always have condoms with you (and use them), and being on birth-control is a bad idea either. Btw it has been know that a FWB can turn into a boyfriend.

Good luck!
