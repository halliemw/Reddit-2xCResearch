>(Being short also means that a weight loss or gain of 10 lbs, which would be pretty normal on a taller person, can suddenly push you over either side of the line of looking scrawny or overweight...which can make clothes shopping that much more frustrating.)

Once I got done having babies, I had liposuction on my lower abdomen.  I lost all the weight, but I still thought I looked 4 months pregnant.  Best decision ever!!!  Now I can gain 10 pounds and it goes to all the right places.  I just get some curves.  So there's that.
