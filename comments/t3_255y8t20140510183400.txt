It's like a Chinese Ebay I guess? SUPER CHEAP because it cuts out the middle man. 

I have ordered 3 rockabilly dresses off there - all good quality. 

And [these](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Spa-plus-size-plus-size-one-piece-with-sleeves-mm-3XL-6xl-female-swimwear-multicolor/819836971.html) swimwear in 3 different colours - good quality and SUPER flattering. 

I have ordered [this set](http://www.aliexpress.com/item/8pcs-Premium-Synthetic-Kabuki-Makeup-Brush-Set-Cosmetics-Foundation-blending-blush/1665008822.html) of makeup brushes and they are great quality and identical to Shaaanxo's XOBeauty set but WAY cheaper. (I own one of Shaaan's round top blender brushes and the one in this set is literally identical in appearance, use and quality). 

All up, I love the site, and it's free shipping (I think worldwide? I'm in New Zealand) but it takes about 30 days to get here... worth the wait for the drop in price in my opinion. Well packaged too.
