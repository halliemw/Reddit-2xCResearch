I wigged out  the first time this happened too. Thankfully I had my mum, who told me what was going on.
When you ovulate , you can pass a  cervical mucus plug whole, based on your description that is what you saw. Depending on your age this could be the start of a new trend in you body, it gives you a more literal heads up when it is sending another egg into play. It is perfectly normal, but if you are concerned talk to your medical care provider.
