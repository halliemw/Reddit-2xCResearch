First off every other job I've had I have never been this stressed out. As for the yelling, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. If you're yelling at someone and they seem to react negatively to it, why the hell would you continue. 

I do thank you for your post and opinion, but telling me im useless and always wasting his doesn't make me want to work. It makes me scared and just completely wash away my moral.  I can undedstand if I had been working there for a few months, but he expects me to read his mind and assume things in cases I've never come across. His expectations are incredibly high and he knew I had no experience when he hired me. It baffles me.
