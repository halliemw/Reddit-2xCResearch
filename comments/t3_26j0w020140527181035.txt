I can totally relate to his post. I didn't really talk about it with friends and the ones that knew never made fun of me for it. If anything, they were trying to be helpful in telling me that it would come eventually or that it wasn't a big deal. By the time I was 24, eventually started to look like never. The vast majority of the pressure came from myself. Realizing I was going to soon be 25 and I hadn't kissed a girl since I was 16 made me feel like a loser. I didn't think I was attractive, but I also didn't think I was ugly. I don't know if that helped or hurt, since if I wasn't ugly then it meant I wasn't funny, cool, outgoing, or interesting enough to have someone interested in me. It was one of the few times I've felt societal pressure get to me as a guy. Most other things society / media says men should be or strive for haven't really affected me, or if they have, it has been minor. This was a huge deal.
