Because hers is the one story nobody knows? Because she was naive and now has years under her belt to be able to reflect on the situation, because she was vilified by republicans and the press for not using good judgment? Because she is a part of history whether we like it or not? Because what happened to her is still happening today when powerful men have affairs with naive women? Because the countries idea of women being sluts and men being studs is sickening and wrong?

I mean... Seriously!
