I don't want to minimize this woman's pain, but how is anyone ever supposed to be able to come to a fair determination when as in this case the accuser waits (for whatever her reasons are, normal rape victim responses, shame, fear, etc) for an extended period to report the rape so that there is no physical evidence of rape?

It then becomes she said he said. How can anyone be expected to determine what happened in those circumstances? I know people say false rape claims are extremely unlikely, but we can't simply give blanket acceptance as true and report of rape simply because false rape claims are rare. Also I wish all crime victims at colleges would just go straight to the police and eliminate the ineffective unversity from the equation.
