I lived in Korea as an expat for awhile, so I understand where you're coming from. Have you tried joining some clubs to make friends? I used meetup.com, couchsurfing.com (I made one really close friend through that site and met loads of people) and there were even some online forums for expats in Korea. You can also try reddit if the city you're living in has a subreddit. Another thing to try is craigslist and post looking for new friends, I made a great female friend doing this! I also recommend Italian language lessons, you can meet some new people through there and learn too!
