True dat. My dad was real with me- I had my girly things, but I also had time with my dad watching action movies, playing Legos, bike riding, etc. Honestly I think just treating her like a kid who is working her way up to being a participating adult in society is pretty much the best way to go. She'll listen to anything you say, so talk to her like you would talk to an adult (of course, with explaining certain things, etc.)
