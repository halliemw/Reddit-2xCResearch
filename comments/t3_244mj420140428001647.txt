It wasn't exactly a matter of "walking into a local clinic." I live in a large metropolitan U.S. city, which happens to attract all sorts of specialists internationally, so the clinics in my area are all pretty damn good. I based my choice on the professionalism of the medical staff, their IVF success rates, donor/recipient testimonies/ratings, and my ability to travel to the clinic, as the donation process requires being able to visit the clinic every other day for testing. I can answer this question in a more detailed manner if you PM me. :)
