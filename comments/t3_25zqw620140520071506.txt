I'm a teacher, and we actually have problems with this. You can't prosecute a child with a crime until they are 10. You have to prosecute their parents instead. 

We had a little boy who was committing assault on a daily basis. He was 9. His parents were nice people who truly tried, but this kid had medical problems that spiraled out of control. No one wanted to prosecute his parents. We couldn't prosecute him for assault until he was 10. No other discipline we attempted came close to working. He knew the law, and when he turned 10 he toed the line for almost 3 months before he slipped up. And then we prosecuted him when he bit an aid hard enough to draw blood. 

You can't prosecute an 8 year old for rape.
