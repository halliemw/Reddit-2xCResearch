I think the answer to your question depends on the frequency and severity of the breakdowns.

If this is an occasional thing and isn't a relationship deal breaker for you, then I suggest you accept it as part of who he is, listen to him and do your best to be encouraging and supportive.

Gently trying to provide him with a little perspective on the issue may be of some help, as he sounds like someone who is aware of his behavior and tries to do better, but don't expect results to be fast.  Repetition, patience, and a gentle touch will be key here.  It may take months or years to see a significant impact, and he may never completely change.  You need to be OK with that.

If it's a really serious problem, then you could suggest, or even push for, therapy.  But you can't make him go.

Perhaps most importantly, avoid viewing this as your problem to fix.  That will only lead to frustration, and if you get frustrated you'll make it worse (trust me on this, I've done it with my wife, who has had medium-serious self esteem issues for as long as we've been together).  Instead, try to see this as a small flaw in an otherwise excellent partner.  Be as supportive and helpful as you can, but do not take ownership of the issue.  You cannot fix (or otherwise control) other people, no matter how much you may love them.
