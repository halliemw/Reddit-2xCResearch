I'm using animals euphemistically here--in case you hadn't realized.  In this context I mean ignoring social cues that certain behaviours are unwelcome and unwanted--or realizing that and carrying on anyway.  Sure they can be distracted, but if they had it called to their attention often enough, they'd learn to censure themselves.

I think you're not understanding the opposite side of the coin clearly here.  From the time girls hit puberty they are ogled by men, and not all of them have the excuse of being teenagers.  It happens waiting at the bus stop, walking down the street, at the mall etc--and I assure you these girls aren't prepared either.

It isn't a lack of empathy precisely, at least not in my case, it's an understanding that these boys are actively making others feel uncomfortable and self conscious--that their actions are potentially harming others means they need to be corrected, whether I'm empathetic or not.
