I'm so sorry to hear that! I've had someone shut down like that on me too. For me, I use the excuse of "I have a tiny clit and it's hard to find" to soften the blow, but some men feel like it's a reflection on them, not a matter of every woman's body being different and it being a physiological probability. I hope he can get past his hurt feelings and talk about it like an adult :/
