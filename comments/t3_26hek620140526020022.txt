It's nothing so fancy as a sari, but my mom, sister and I all wear the same size shoes and share a penchant for converse sneakers.  At one point in high school I think we had a collective 30 pairs floating around the house.  Sequins, candy cane stripes, easter bunnies, flames, you name it, we had the converse.
