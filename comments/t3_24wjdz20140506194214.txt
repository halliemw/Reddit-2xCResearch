He seems extremely unwilling to communicate; that's not your fault. You clearly tried, but you got one-line answers. You can't force communication with someone, even nicely.  I think writing was a good medium though, since writing doesn't become yelling. Maybe as part of another email suggest to him that you should try written communication to work this out?  If you get nothing but growled at, I'm afraid it likely is a bad bet. You're putting emotions and effort into something that he won't.  Find a person willing to communicate with you (in polite words!) and treat you like an equal.

Also this sounds exactly like what my housemates are going through.   :( Probably not the same people though...
