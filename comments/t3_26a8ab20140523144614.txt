Except the majority of the time both people are drunk. So who is supposed to determine who is too drunk? Plus I don't know why you would be talking about people with a great deal of difference in inebriation as I already said that was inappropriate. Yes I know there's a risk, but I'm saying that risk is bullshit. Also, I'm suuuure those one night stands will definitely want to go get coffee with you the next day instead of hooking up with you. That definitely fits the goal they're after.
