My mom thought I wasn't eating in high school either. I never are breakfast at home because I had to be at school so early and I find it really hard to eat before a certain time in the morning, so I was eating once I got to school. She didn't know that though. 

We really need to just sit back and stop this kind of crap. If your kids wants to play with barbie let them. If you kid doesn't, okay too. If it's hot outside and the girls are wearing shorts and stuff don't tell them they can't do this because it's giving the men ideas. Let's just stop focusing on women's bodies, unless of course someone is in danger due to an eating disorder. Perhaps we'd all feel a bit better about ourselves if this kind of crap stopped.
