I never have had many issues with getting harrassed specifically for being a girl.  I don't act in a way that would single out what gender I was anyway because I tend to keep to myself or just not even mention it.  

When I played World of Warcaft more seriously and used voice, sometimes people would "troll" me but it was pretty clear they were quite lowlife themselves and I took it with a grain of salt.  Because any man that wanted to do well socially in this world wouldn't dare pull the sexism card in the first place, so why dwell on it?  They can go have fun looking like idiots.
