So my boyfriend is tall, lean and athletic, handsome as anything. I am pretty, but short and overweight, and he loves it, he'd probably have me put on 5kg xD  I love my body, I don't think you're being fair to yourself by suddenly thinking being overweight makes you repulsive, you still have all the same redeeming features as before.

You really need to work on your self esteem and get to a healthy weight which makes you happy.
