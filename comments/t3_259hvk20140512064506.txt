My employer doesn't pay directly for my specific kids' education. Do you think the workforce would look different if they did?

Put another way... Society has deemed that it's better for all of us if we fund the education of everyone's kids. It's fairly easy to see the public benefit here. What's the public benefit of making sure a new parent gets to take time off from work at someone else's expense? What are the public costs?
