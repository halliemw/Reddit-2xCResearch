We all have our hair struggles but I do think truly fine, thin hair is often overlooked. But maybe I am just biased!

I'm not too daring with my personal style, I guess sort of preppy/outdoorsy/traditional and fairly low maintenance. I am also 38 (so a bit older than the average here) and have a professional job where I need to be able to dress nicely. I cut my hair short about 6 years ago after I finally admitted that I could no longer wear it shoulder length and pretend it looked decent. I had it kind of like [this](http://chpyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/popular-short-haircuts-99.jpg) for a long time, only imagine she has about half that volume of hair, ha ha ha. Then I had a bunch of hair fall out due to stress and kind of grew what I had left out. Right now it's kind of a bob that just below chin length and a little layered in the back. I want to go back to the shorter style but I'm nervous that it won't work now that my hair is even thinner.

I most definitely wash it and restyle it every day, otherwise it's oily, clumpy and flat. Plus, sleeping on it makes it all crazy and, as you know, with thin hair it has no weight to help it settle back into its style. I haven't experimented much with dry shampoo, but when I have it doesn't seem like it's much help. Because I am somewhat low maintenance and don't care that much, I'm not overly fastidious about products and styling. I am actually using [Honest Company Shampoo + Body Wash](https://www.honest.com/bath-and-body/shampoo-body-wash) as, well, both of those things. It's probably not the best thing for my hair, but it is gentle at least. I have Matrix Amplify conditioner. I bought it at Marshalls because I am cheap. I use about a dime sized drop of [Purology Blow Dry Amplifier](http://www.pureology.com/systems/pure-volume/blowdryamplifier) before I dry my hair and then I just use a round brush and make it smooth and try to curl it under at the bottom to get that bob look. I am slightly lucky in that my hair texture is somewhat agreeable, it has a little bend to it and will generally hold its shape. (Unless, of course, it is humid out and then it's all wispy and wingy.) And that's about it. I use those microclips to pull the front back when I exercise because a tiny ponytail looks absolutely ridiculous.

I don't think you should dye your hair black, either. I think you can compromise and do a darker, dramatic color that has some highlights and lowlights to give it more dimension than a flat color.
