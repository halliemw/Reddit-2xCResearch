There is no doubt in my mind that if true universal healthcare without cost being a factor was available in the US, the death rate would fall. People in general - not just women - currently avoid going to the doctor because they are worried about the costs involved, or limit their check ups because of the same concerns, etc. They may opt not to get certain procedures if there is no coverage available. 

Also the US trends high for c-sections and the rate of interference in birth which also leads to more complications and danger.
