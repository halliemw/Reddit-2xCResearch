That's okay too - we often need to be strategic.  Indeed, it's only in my most intimate relationships that I'm completely myself (it's rare indeed that I find someone with whom I can completely be myself).

At the same time, there are only a handful of people I feel I need to stay away from - and it's entirely up to me to decide who those people are.  They often need stronger signals in order to understand my boundaries. 

You sound like a very congenial and forgiving person (and rational too).
