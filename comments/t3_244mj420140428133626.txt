I don't know whether diabetes would rule out a woman from donating (I suspect that it would, however)--that is something that you will have to ask the medical professionals at an IVF clinic.
The treatment as far as I am concerned is not known to have any significant impact on your overall health; at least at this point no adverse long-term effects have been proven.

Edit: Specified that my answer was in reference to long-term effects.
