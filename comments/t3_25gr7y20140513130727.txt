Look, no one likes going to the gynecologist. My mom had to drag me practically kicking and screaming to my first ever appointment. It's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, etc., but you have to put on your big girl panties and just do it. Honestly, the more times you go, the easier it gets. 

You can't force her to get the help she needs- she can has to do that on her own. However, it sounds like she has some anxiety or some other psychological issues that are preventing her from going to the doctor. 

She shouldn't be upset with the doctor for giving her an abnormal pap result, unless some other issues are in play. I would encourage her to see a therapist to discuss this issue, and continue to encourage her to go back to the doctor. This is about her health. Ignoring warning signs, like an abnormal pap, is like pulling the key on a grenade and waiting for it to go off. Something like that won't resolve itself on its own. HPV can develop into cervical cancer. However, it doesn't seem like she's mentally prepared to face those test results until her other issues are addressed.  

Last, but not least, if she's testing positive for HPV, that's a problem for you, because you could get it and pass it along to someone else. Also, her lack of sex drive has to be taking a toll on your relationship. I think she needs to see a therapist, because it sounds like she's blaming everyone else in order to avoid addressing her problem.
