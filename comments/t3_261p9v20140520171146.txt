No, mansplaining is saying "See, the wage gap, the STEM gap, all these serious economic consequences of sexism DON'T EXIST because girls do better than boys in school, which is the *real* problem." Which is how a lot of this research is playing out. 

I have a feeling that this is happening because historically girls have had to work *n* times as hard as boys to get equal attention in school, so now that things have evened up a little bit, they're surging ahead. And boys, lacking the privilege they once had, aren't being taught how to buckle down and do the work. But we need to find out more, and we also need to realize that education is, for the most part, a means to an end... and if in the end, women are still paid less, shunted into lower-paying fields, promoted less, and so forth, then all the A's in the world don't mean diddly-squat.
