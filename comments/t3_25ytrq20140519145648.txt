unfortunately, people like that guy are a fact of life. and i feel ya, i really do, about trying to not interact with people on certain comment threads. it's part of why i don't get my news from reddit, but from facebook, where it's easier for me to not interact with the trolls. i don't really have any advice (not that you were really looking for any?) but i want to say that you were absolutely in the right to share your experience and to want to be taken seriously for doing so. stay positive.
