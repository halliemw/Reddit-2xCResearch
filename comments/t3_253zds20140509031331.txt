Ah good point, does Nuva Ring also require a prescription or a doctor to insert it?


I unfortunately didn't bring my phone with me to google anything, but that's a good idea for next time. I feel like she would have been embarrassed if I'd mentioned anything that was specifically related to sex work though, especially because I might be way off base with that assumption anyway.
