I'm pursuing my PhD, didn't think I wanted one when I started my masters (it's in the same program) but now it feels like a good fit. I think the difference is that I found a research area that I am passionate about and I really feel like I can do something meaningful with it. You just have to figure out if that's where your passions lie, or if your time is better spent elsewhere. For me the question was about being a practitioner vs. a researcher, but I know there are different options in different fields.
