Well your comment was deleted, so I can't clarify exactly what about it struck me as mean and unnecessary. 

And yes, as far as I understand, a financial abortion is the ridiculous idea that if a dude lets a lady know he doesn't wanna be a dad, and she gets pregnant anyways by accident or whatever and decides to keep it, he can petition to not pay child support. So basically the child gets to suffer for the parents' mistakes, which is exactly what current laws try to prevent.
