My thoughts are, if we can get past this, and he wants to start again, I can trust him, because he ended our relationship based on this. I am living with him now, because I have nowhere else to go and he is helping me completely. I can get past this because these things happened in the distant past. I honestly want to forgive him, because I've been he cheater before. I don't want to let a persons mistakes define them. Because I cheated on a past boyfriend, (in high school) but I never wanted to cheat on him. My heart is just so invested in him. It almost feels wrong to give up.
