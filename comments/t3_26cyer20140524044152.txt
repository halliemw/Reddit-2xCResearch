I'm addicted to LUSH's bath products - especially the bath bombs. My favorites are Twilight (which smells sort of sweet, but also like lavender, and turns the water a gorgeous purple-y color), Phoenix Rising (another purple one that smells like apple cider), and Sex Bomb (pink and rose/jasmine scented). I also love their Brightside bubble bar, which turns the water bright orangey-pink and smells like citrus.

When I don't have any LUSH goodies to use, though, I like to use rose or jasmine oil and light some matching scented candles around my tub. Also, I used some bath salts that were eucalyptus and lavender scented at a friend's house that were amazing, but sadly I don't remember the brand or anything. Baths are the *best* way to relax and wind down, IMO. Love them!
