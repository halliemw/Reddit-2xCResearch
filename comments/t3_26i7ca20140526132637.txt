Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry that happened to you.  You are so brave.  Kudos to you for reaching out for support.  

I recommend seeing a counselor if you're not already.  No stigma.  It's just nice to have a safe place to go and talk about what you're going through, without judgement, and get advice for how to deal.  Being a teenager is hard enough.  

Stay strong, mama.  xoxo
