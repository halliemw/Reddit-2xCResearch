I saw this picture and didn't even see your backpack bulge. I saw the beautiful landscape and how happy you looked and thought about how I want to go to there. :) and its that body,  "bulges" and all, that was strong enough to carry that backpack and take you on that hike. So fat stores be damned. :)
