Call him out on it! Be loud. "STOP TOUCHING ME LIKE THAT ITS CREEPY" "STOP TOUCHING ME IN A SEXUAL WAY". 

Once a guy hit my butt with a cue stick when we were playing pool and I hit him in the face. It was unacceptable of him to do it. Confrontation is a shock for many creeps and even for people who don't mean to be creepy and are ignorant as to why they are being inappropriate. But your uncle definitely knows what he is doing and he needs to be stopped. 

Are there any young family members that should be looked after in case he has been molesting them or doing the same to them? Warn any younger cousins and their parents!! Shared DNA is no excuse to inappropriate behaviour. But maybe be careful when warning parents? Some family members get defensive over these types of topics and then vehemently deny it which then puts others in a vulnerable position. But he needs to be put in his place!
