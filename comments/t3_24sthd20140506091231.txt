Obviously don't feel compelled to share your situation, but I'm curious about this.  Are you not on meds because you don't need them, or because of the stigma we're talking about? If it's the stigma thing, I just want to say that I know a lot of people you will encounter in the mental health field are nowhere near as kind, empathic, or helpful as you need them to be, but please keep looking until you find someone who treats you with the respect you deserve.  I'm part of a big graduating class of social workers who have all learned the ways the system has fucked with people at their most vulnerable, and how it continues to do so.  We are all trying actively to change that.  No matter what, I hope you have found ways to be happy and healthy!
