I stayed at my undergrad university and went straight through. In retrospect I wish I would have gained career experience first butt I had an offer for a full ride to continue helping a professor with a research project I started senior year. Overall it worked well for me. I put in my "dues" post MBA with an entry level job but was promoted quickly at my company.
