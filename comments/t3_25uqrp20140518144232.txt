I'm 28 and my mother and I are pretty damn close. We had a rocky relationship when I was a kid, but now that I'm an adult and we're on more equal footing things have gotten a lot better between us.

So I think I can at least understand why your mother came to you, since I know damn well my own would do the same thing in that situation. Yes, she's my mother, but I'm not a little girl anymore I'm a grown woman. That means I'm more than capable of helping support her emotionally in situations like that. That doesn't make her a bad parent! In fact I think it speaks loads for their parenting ability that the know they can rely on us as adults in these sorts of situations.

I'd also second the whole shelter/housing assistance thing. There are a lot of great programs out there to help people these days and there's nothing wrong with reaching out for a helping hand when you need one.
