> All the Sister1/Sister2 drama aside, I would start looking for employment elsewhere. Don't make a big production about it...don't let on that you are unhappy in your current position, just start looking, get all your ducks in a row, and then resign on good terms.

Eh, you know in this current job market, it may not be the smartest idea to leave a well paying and flexible job(despite not having paid sick leave) because these two ninnies are annoying. Annoying and taking advantage of laws set to protect women in the work place. They just set a bad example. They play the sympathy card, my favorite is about how they are unwed single mothers. No one forced you to get pregnant. Sorry, don't understand how that excuse gets them any sympathy...

>I've worked with several pregnant women in several different companies. None of them behaved like Sister1/2. My pregnant friend commuted 1.5 hours from NJ to her demanding NYC job via walking/bus/subway right up until, like, 2 weeks before she gave birth. 

Every woman is different. Some women have very difficult pregnancies and by comparing them to your friend makes it unfair to women who just physically can't be fully competent in a work environment or require more time off.

I also, and this is my opinion, is if you can handle the morning sickness and can stay home from work because you faint while pregnant or have loose frequent bowel movements, then do so, don't mess around with anti-whatever medications that have unknown consequences.
