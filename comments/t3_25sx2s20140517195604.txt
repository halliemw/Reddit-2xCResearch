> buying into the term "slut shaming" feels like buying into the sexist idea that there are sluts in the first place

Not for me - and I don't "take words back", either.

It just feels like buying into the idea that it's a word people use. I never got the "If you say slut shaming, you're calling someone a slut!" thing. Uh, no. I'm not. I'm saying someone *else* is saying it, and that it's a very handy one word shorthand for all the other things they say that could be boiled down that way.

It's less "stop shitting on sluts" and more "stop shitting on people via calling them sluts".
