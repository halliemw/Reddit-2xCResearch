Thank you for taking the time to write all this out! We are SO GOOD at #s 1 and 2. I think empathy is indeed the hardest, and it's the one we have to figure out if we have or not. 

>How does this relate to your situation? Well, first of all, get those three going. Now. But if you AND YOUR PARTNER (this is obviously critical) fully buy into these three things, it doesn't matter what you disagree about because it will always reach a satisfactory resolution (though that resolution may be "we'll agree to disagree"). This includes religion, politics, whatever.

I really like this theory. Thanks again.
