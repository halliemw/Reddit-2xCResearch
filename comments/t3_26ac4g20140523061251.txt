FFS I live in a country renowned of all the progressive policies to everything. 

These studies about how much women want to work, were done by independent universities with both female as male study leads. We are a surprisingly exception in the world in this one. 

The studies who focused on wages found indeed that wages were lower for a female than a male in an exact same situation and I agree that's bad.

But stop with getting angry at me, when i say that women in my country don't want to work as much as males. Is just a fact.
