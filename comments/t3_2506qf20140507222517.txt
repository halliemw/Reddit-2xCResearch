Whoa there, sorry if I came across as promoting "menz" as you put it, but that was totally not my intent.  By asking why they would be doing different things, I was trying to point out that "nutrition and body image" learning seems very gender specific, like here are things girls learn about and here are things boys learn about. I just don't agree with that, sorry if you find that offensive. 

First off, I'm a woman who happens to be an engineer. I've also been a member of this sub for a while, and I've never had a reply like yours so kudos I suppose.  Having grown up in the rural southern US, I responded with what would've helped me when I was that age.  In an area where maybe these girls aren't getting encouraged to look at science or math as a viable option for them to be good at, this is a huge opportunity for a teacher to encourage them.
