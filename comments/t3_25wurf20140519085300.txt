> We are all on a sliding scale of something

Yeah, this is so true. I'm the opposite of ASD, super empathetic, high affect, emotive, etc. People get comfortable with me so fast, I've literally spoke with someone on the phone and heard their life's story after 15 minutes. Unfortunately, this also means personal boundaries breakdown with me fast, and I have a hard time holding back. The conventional wisdom is if someone says "hey, how's it going?" you're supposed to be positive/simple and say "doing fine" or "good" or whatever, but I can't when it's not true. I can't fake, I just can't, I wear everything all out on my sleeve. Turns out people really don't care about your problems and don't want to hear it :/ Coincidentally I actually do (love 2X because that's all we do for each other here!), but I don't get that back from the world much. So wow, this sort of turned out longer than I intended.

TL;DR there's tons of weirdness in us all, and over doing "social-ness" can be just as bad missing social cues :/ Also, 2X is awesome, of course ;)
