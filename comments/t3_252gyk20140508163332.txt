Your insurance covered the car, so you have little personal stake in the outcome of the prosecution. A serial arsonist is unlikely to target you for revenge.

Nothing you say is going to get you into trouble as long as you tell the truth. If you're not sure of something, indicate that. Be mindful that you're just speaking matter of factly about an incident that happened and none of the questioning will go anywhere uncomfortable for you.

Don't dwell on it. Just go when you're scheduled and you'll be fine.
