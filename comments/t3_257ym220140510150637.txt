I think it's part of tokenizing people who engage in non-stereotypical activities or interests. Guys who are good with kids are said to be cute, while women are seen as caring or yknow, just good with kids, especially if no one is behaving in a particularly cutesy way (except the kids, of course). Calling someone as a diminutive often seems like "it's notable that you think you can do something that others can do better". 

It's also a matter of assuming that you're doing some for appearances, rather than because you just like the thing, which I find to be a strange devaluation of whatever that thing is. If you think it's good enough to do it yourself, then why would you assume people who would stereotypically not take part in it are just doing it for attention or validation? 

I like scotch and that brings on some weird attention. If you think I'm pretending to enjoy the taste of peat to get a dude's attention, then you either are pretending to enjoy that drink because it makes you manly or you find that scotch is somehow more adorable when drunk by a lady. It tastes like delicious dirt. I fail to see how the gender of taste buds involved makes a difference.
