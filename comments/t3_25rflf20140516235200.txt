I wear jeans and t-shirts pretty much all the time, but when my SO makes suggestions about my clothes, I usually take them. It's not as if it's that big a deal to put in extra effort sometimes and usually when I do, I end up having a better time wherever we're going anyway. It just gets things started on a better foot.
