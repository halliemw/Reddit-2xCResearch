Mostly appearance stuff. I really like doing my make-up and painting my nails, interestingly though I hate doing my hair and wear it super short. I like to wear dresses and skirts and get all dolled up for a night out. I dance ballet, which I suppose is seen as "traditionally feminine" though really that's a false perception. I love girly music -- pop divas, girl groups, musical theater. Oh, and you can pry my pink wine from my cold dead hands.
