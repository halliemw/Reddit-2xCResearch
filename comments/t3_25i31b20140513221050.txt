Thanks for sharing. That had me a little teary eyed, I won't lie. Those are great pictures. My dad passed away when I was 18 so while you cherish this moment, remember you make sure to make moments in the future to cherish as well! Nobody knows how much time we have on this earth so be sure to get time with your dad whenever you can! The smallest memory kind wind up meaning the most.
