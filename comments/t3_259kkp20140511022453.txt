Dated a black guy in highschool. Got to rid myself of two "friends" who told me I was roo pretty to date a [slur]. For some reason,  they both thought it was important to tell me that they would never date a white girl that had dated a black guy, like I was goimg to break up with my bf. Those kinds of people are utter trash.
