I don't think they notice, which is not to excuse them. Both men and women grew up in a world saying that women want to please men. It's exactly the same message for both. For women, it means conforming to aesthetic and behavioral norms - cutting your hair short while men apparently prefer long hair is even seen as a rebellion - getting called lesbians and "damaged" - as if even that choice had to be in consideration for men.

Men are not receiving that kind of feedback nearly as repeatedly, consistently or constantly as women do, so most of them don't notice. The world around them reinforces the idea that women wear makeup for them, dye their hair for them, wear clothes and shave their legs for them, because that's what the commercials, among other medias, tell them. It's just so normal.

A lot of them feel the need to reassure women about standards: "I prefer larger women" and "I like women with small breasts" are the kind of comments that, unsolicited, come from the feeling that their preferences should have an impact on women's choices. It can be absolutely well-meaning, but they're still missing the point: it doesn't have anything to do with them. A lot of women defying the common standards in many ways - naturally very, very skinny, very curvaceous, short-haired, tattooed, flat-chested, not wearing any makeup, wearing a lot of makeup - still manage to feel sexy and attractive, regardless of the validation of men. Because it's not about them.
