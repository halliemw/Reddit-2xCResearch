I second guess my decision every day.  I could write a novel about how NOT to do a PhD.  I am in my last year of my PhD and I moved from the US to the UK to do it.  I'm all loan funded and owe a zillion dollars in loans.

I wasn't planning on getting into this, it sort of just happened after I did my second Masters and couldn't get a job afterward.   I've been having a rough year with personal issues, family issues, and depression and will probably need to get an extension as I am really far behind.  I have about 10K words written in all.

I have really enjoyed the traveling and the ability to live in the country I wanted to live in all my life, but there are days where I wonder what I got myself into.  I still don't know what I want to do with my life; I'm 38 with no partner or idea about job prospects for when I am done, nor do I know where I will be living when I am done.

I'm sure things will work out (hopefully) but definitely have a long term plan and backup plans just in case.
