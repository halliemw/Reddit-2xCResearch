I had an epiphany the other day.

I'm going to be purposefully vague so that I don't "out" my job.

I had the occasion via work to interact with someone I did not know, and I saw by her email address that she proclaimed to be a Christian also.  For a moment I was tempted to send her an email and say hey, I'm a Christian too, and just seeing your email address uplifted me and reminded me that I'm not alone.

But then I saw (online) where she had been exceptionally rude and cruel to someone else and I was scared to approach her, because I know that not everyone who says they believe, would receive that well.

And suddenly it kind of hit me...oh...yeah...this is what it feels like to be someone who doesn't believe as I do, and to witness this kind of behavior from the outside looking in.

It made me really take to heart the Scripture that says that if you don't love people, then you don't love Jesus no matter what you say.   (paraphrasing).
