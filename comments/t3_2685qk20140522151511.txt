Sexual jealousy huh? I hadnt thought of that. It may explain why she was acting that way today of all days. We were after all hanging with mostly guys. I do try not to be threatening, I dont dress too provocatively and I dont flirt with guys who my friends like, but may be that isnt enough. I'll wait out this round of sulks and monitor the next time it happens to see if there was anything I could have done to make her more comfortable. 

Thanks heaps all of you who responded!
