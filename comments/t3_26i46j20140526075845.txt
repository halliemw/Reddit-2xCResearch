Oh no! I totally understand this fear but don't worry. I have several friends who have gotten breast reductions and they are all soooo much happier. Their back pains have been reduced like CRAZY. If anyone asks (not that it's their business but if you feel the need to answer them) lie, tell them its for back purposes or whatever. It's not really their business and if it's something you really want go for it!
