I don't know how old you are but when I was like 17 I tried getting an iud and couldn't even get past the measuring even with drugs.  But then a few months ago at 22 (still with no kids) I got one put in.  It still hurt a lot, but I was able to get it done.  Just giving it some time might be the best option.
