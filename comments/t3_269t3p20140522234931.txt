What exactly do you think you are addressing from the post?  Op is merely looking for advice on how to support her sister through a really difficult time; she does not indicate that she needs advice on accepting others viewpoints. She seems to be doing fine with that actually. She simply does not like seeing her sister hurting and wants to help her.  I feel like all you are doing here is preaching.
