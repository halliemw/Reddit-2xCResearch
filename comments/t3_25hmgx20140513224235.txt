Find out if the student evaluations are typed before being shown to the professor. Almost all universities collect the evaluations well before finals, but they are rarely processed and given back until a few weeks have passed after the end of the term. For many public universities, doing so is illegal. At my university, I usually don't see student feedback until a month has gone by in the next term, and all of the feedback is typed to prevent retaliation.  

In any case , this is a serious case of harassment that can land this professor and his department in serious trouble. It could be that the department does not want him to stick around but has their hands tied because he is tenured. With evidence, however, they can take action, especially if there are similar complaints. 

As a professor, I'm sorry to hear that this happened to you. I would encourage you to make your department aware of this problem. Odds are that they have had other complaints, but until someone puts it in writing there is no "evidence" that lets the university act. If you have questions about how to approach your department, feel free to PM me.
