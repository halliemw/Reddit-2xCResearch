No. Even of mods are deleting the hateful comments, it's still going to be pretty rough for people who post here with sensitive issues. Just the fact that we're opening up to default means we're going to see a huge increase in the "you dirty slut/baby killer/you deserved it" bullshit. I've already gotten sexually explicit PMs and I just ranted about the default status, I don't want to know what I'd get if I posted about a sexual assault or abortion decision.
