My mother is a terrible person. She's seriously the most difficult person I have to interact with on a regular basis. I dread talking to her even though I have to do it almost daily. I don't wish her harm, and hope she finds peace with herself and others, but I do wish we could stop talking or interacting entirely, but I know I'm the only person in her life left.  

I have similar feelings as you. She's old and sick, has heart failure and (IMO) obvious mental disorders. But she also expects me to do EVERYTHING for her, and then insults me constantly, puts me down, makes me feel bad for my very existence, and then expects me to love her and praise her.
  
Honestly, the relationship is sick. And I'd be better without her. Sounds like a similar situation to yours. I cope by not telling her too much. The smile and nod. And then complain about it to friends and my partner. Vent, get it off my chest, and let it go. It can be very difficult. And if you have the ability, it might be good for you to talk to a professional, because if you're like me, you'll have 20-something odd years of built up anger, frustration, are emotionally bereft and unable to deal with/adequately process feelings, depression, anxiety, etc.
