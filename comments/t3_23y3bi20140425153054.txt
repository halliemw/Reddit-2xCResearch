funny. after watching so many women and men post on reddit in different subs (fitness, skincare, makeup, hair) the only conclusion for me is that there's a lot of beautiful people in the world, and that we all come in many different beautiful packages. i understand your concern because i think about it sometimes too, but i'm just saying there's a glass-half-full possibility you're ignoring.
