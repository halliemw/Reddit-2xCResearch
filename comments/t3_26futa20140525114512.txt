That may be the case on the surface, but looking deeper, it would seem that his crime was fueled by continual rejection. He wasn't social with anyone in younger years and it doesn't look like he had any friends at the time he committed the crime. I recently watched a documentary called "Reject" in which researchers discovered that rejection triggers the same areas in the brain as physical pain. When animals (including humans) experience immense physical pain, it leads to aggression. That aggression may be expressed toward one particular group, but that might just mean that that group is the primary focus at the time.
