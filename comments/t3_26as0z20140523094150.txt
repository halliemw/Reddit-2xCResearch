At home my mother always complained about things like dishes being unwashed, kids not helping with laundry, etc.

The thing is that she never taught either child how to do laundry until, literally, the day before each of us went away.

Whenever we did dishes, it was always wrong - "Why did you put this in the machine, you could have hand washed it!"  "Why did you hand wash this? You could have put it in the machine."

I'm sure that her complaints made sense to her. The problem was that every time the rest of the family - kids or my dad - tried to do what she wanted, we messed it up, and weren't ever really told how she wanted it done. So we stopped trying as hard, since regardless of what we did, she got angry.

My family lacked in communication. Your advice to OP to try to have good communication is wonderful, because a lot of people get caught in this trap - it's a loving relationship, each side wants to do the right thing, but they don't know how.
