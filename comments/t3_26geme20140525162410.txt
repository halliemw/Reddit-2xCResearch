Yep, I know that feeling. My dad was thrilled that he's under 100kg. When he said it, I didn't think I was (I was, by a whole 2kg...). I was really happy for him (especially since he had a cholesterol-induced heart attack last year!), but man that *hurt*.  
  
And here I am, two weeks later, weighing in at 95kg and **6cm** off my waist!  
  
It sucks that it got to you (and it wasn't really nice of him to say), but try and leave that in the past and focus on what you've been doing to get in shape. Because you *can* achieve your goals. Go out and get 'em! :)
