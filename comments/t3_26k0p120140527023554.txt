One of my cheating exes gave me the password to her phone and it was because of this that I found out she had been cheating. She was passed out when the guy tried calling her at 3am so I, being drunk and suspicious, checked her text history with the dude. I found out she'd basically been playing both of us since day one. 

Except the other guy knew and they'd talk shit on me over text while she spent almost every minute with me (the other guy lived a lot father away than I did). I felt like a total scumbag for going through her messages like that but considering that it gave me a heads up to get out of the relationship before I got any more attached I don't regret doing it. 

Sorry for the rant, reading your comment just reminded me of this shitty event in my life so I wanted to share it. 

TL;DR: Found out my girlfriend at the time was cheating on me by snooping on her phone while she was passed out, I felt like a justified scumbag.
