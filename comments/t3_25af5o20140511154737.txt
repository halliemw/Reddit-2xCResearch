As a guy who lost his mother at the age of 13, and not only that, I was the unfortunate soul who found her, I can only say that losing your mother is an extremely hard thing to do.

Sometimes I think about how she never got to see me grow into a man, how she'll never see me achieve anything great, how I missed out on really getting to know her as a person, instead of just a parent.

Luckily my mother had told me lots of stories about her life, she would often play with me and my sisters and say with deep sadness in her voice that "These are the things you'll remember when I'm no longer here."

She had a bad life, and was constantly depressed, she knew she wouldn't live long, and she was right. She died at age 48. I miss her a lot.

Reading your post was very familiar to me. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to give me a PM.
