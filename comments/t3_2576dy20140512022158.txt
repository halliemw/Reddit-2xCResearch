It's like cancer. Is breast cancer a worthy cause? Of course! Is testicular cancer a worthy cause? Of course! Should one focus on them specifically since they are different diseases under the umbrella of cancer? YES! 

You can't do research against cancer in general, you need to focus on the specific particularities of each cancer in turn. And support of one does not imply neglect of the other. Support is voluntary and there is a limited amount of care a person can give and they can make a personal choice where to put. 

Same with this.  It's people who don't understand that to fix a problem you don't generally treat a host of problems... You focus on the specific problem and find specific ways to combat it. 

Men and women are circumcised with different degrees of mutilation, for WHOLLY different reasons. If you just address it generally you will fail. You need to deal with female circumcision with one policy and male circumcision with another. 

Specific problem. Specific cure.
