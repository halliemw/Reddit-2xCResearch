California checking in.  I work in the Aerospace Industry (so that might be why this happens) but women here get called girls ALL the time.  Even Directors, VPs, and managers.  Even women in their 40s and 50s.  It's kinda mind boggling.  

Even worse, when someone has a complaint about a woman, it usually starts with "This girl!".  One of my college friends works in the High Bay (kinda the factory floor for satellite production/integration/testing) of her company.  She had this awful story where a lead tech was bitching about a Senior Lead Engineer not communicating with him (understandable complaint, but the  Engineer was just following company protocal by communicating with the tech's boss instead, allowing the boss to handle assignments).  Anyways, this guy was going on and on about "This...LITTLE GIRL" and the reality is she was in her 40's, was about 3 levels above him, and had 15 years experience as an engineer...

It's just...super frustrating.
