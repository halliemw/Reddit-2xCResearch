If you care for your parents you should honestly reach out and find a third party you trust/paid professional to sit down and talk with them and have an honest opinion that's not filled with thoughts of he said this and she said this because it seems like you really have NO CLUE what actually happened except the clear case of violence. While I suggest going to the police it's better to be sure of your decision instead of throwing someone to the wolves for something you don't even have full grasp of. 

At the end of the day violence is bad, but common sense, reasoning, a cool head and preserving is what makes situations like this actually show their true sides and appropriate actions can be taken. In the interim I suggest them not being together in the same place.
