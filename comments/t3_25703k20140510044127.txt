Hi there, and welcome to the sub! I think your edit caught some text that would make your last phrase or so a bit clearer, but if you're asking whether it's OK for you to post here the answer is yes. (OP did address "ladies," but I'd respond in another sub if an OP had addressed "guys," so don't fret!)

With that out of the way, you're probably gonna get downvoted. Not because your advice is bad or because you're a guy, but because you're presenting it in a pretty abrasive manner, and that matters a lot around here. 

I think the links you posted are great, and I would like to encourage you to keep participating in the community here - it's going to be learning experience for all of us as we find our new normal since going default, so hopefully my little explanation helps you settle in and feel comfortable!
