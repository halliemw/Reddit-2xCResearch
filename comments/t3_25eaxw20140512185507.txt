I'm really sorry you're going through this.

On April 28th, 2008 I took a little pill that ended my pregnancy.  That's all it took.  I was devastated that I had to make the choice.  I was in college, young, and not ready to have a child.  I knew these things and I knew I could not keep it, but that doesn't make it better or any less painful.  I remember the date because it is significant to me and really changed my world.  Was it right?  Was it wrong?  I don't know, but I am happy with the life I have now and the person I am.  This is my path.

One thing I wish I had done differently was seek counseling or someone to listen.  My ex disappeared when I told him I was pregnant, I was far from family and I was completely alone.  I turned to drugs and alcohol to fend off the feelings and I wish I could take that back.  Time will heal you, but I hope you don't do it alone.
