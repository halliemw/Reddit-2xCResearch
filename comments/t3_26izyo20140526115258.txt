A male alternative to the pill would be great.

For couples in a relationship, it would allow whichever partner had fewer side effects to be the one on medication (or whatever other considerations might exist).  For more casual encounters, you as a guy would have another option for preventing pregnancy (especially when you don't know the other person enough to comfortably rely on them contraception-wise).

Try not to take negative comments to heart.  There is 100% nothing wrong with asking these questions - they're important. Unfortunately, discussing gender/sex related things on the internet will always generate emotional disagreement. Are you getting harassed via PM?

Edit: I'm pretty new here, but it's gotten nasty recently since the sub went default.  There are a lot more creepy/vile PMs being sent around as a result.
