I think one valid point in the article is that friends should do more to support someone who has suffered a breakup, especially if they're feeling confused by the lack of closure. As a man especially, it's probably often hard to find this kind of emotional support. I sympathize with the pain. I just think it's unhealthy that he thinks he deserves that kind of emotional support from the person who broke up with him. That's not where he should be looking for support. And it's unhealthy to dwell so much on how unfair it is to not have closure. The reality is that many losses in life have no closure and that aspect is out of your control. What he needs is to learn to cope with a lack of closure instead of blaming his problems on it.
