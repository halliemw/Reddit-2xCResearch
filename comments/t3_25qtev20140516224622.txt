You're right - I should have specified intoxication is what I meant by drunk. If a person is just buzzed they are able to consent, but if a person is intoxicated they are deemed as not having the capacity to consent, because their state of mind is altered. So even though a person might say yes to having sex while they are intoxicated, because they are intoxicated they are legally unable to consent.
