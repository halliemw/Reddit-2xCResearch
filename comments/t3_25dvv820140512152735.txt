Call the cops and CPS. Now. If nothing else they can provide your mother with plenty in the way of incentive to remove your dad from the family home and help her make sure that he stays gone. 

> He generally becomes dimwitted and acts like an annoying 5-year old, but doesn't get verbally or physically abusive to any of the kids

Not as of *yet*. 

In any case, making your children witness domestic violence is tantamount to child abuse and your mother is playing the part of enabler by failing to report him. As such her opinion is to be disregarded. For the sake of the well-being of your siblings.
