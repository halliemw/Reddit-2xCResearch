Thanks. With how this is going I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they ran off and eloped in three months. He is acting directly opposite to how I thought the person I loved would act.  So because he told me he wasn't ready for marriage, kids and future I should just prepare myself now for it to happen within the year. :)
