In my experience, "I love that bag" might catch someone off guard simply because it's coming from a stranger, but the responses I've gotten have all been positive. Granted, I'm a girl, so it's a bit of a different situation. 

For me though, I don't mind if people and especially men strike up conversation with me (barring when I generally don't want to talk to people regardless of their gender), as long as they don't open that conversation with how I look/how hot I am/what they want to do to me etc. It's also super disconcerting if the person refuses to end the conversation when I've clearly indicated that I don't want to talk to them. To me, that basically says "I don't care about your agency, I'm going to ignore your wishes to fulfill my own desire to have this conversation", which is alarming coming from someone who is a stranger, has expressed sexual interest in me, and is almost definitely physically stronger than me (if it is a man, which has always been the case for me unfortunately).

If you can avoid the above (aka not be an asshole), I think you'll be fine!
