There are, it is government funded and they pay half of your prescripted medicines. I replied to some of these comments about my experiences using their services, and they are more keen on getting you out of there than to waste their funds and help you. People openly joke about their services around here, because usually they don't take you seriously unless you create a huge fuss about it and stand your ground. I'm a wimp who suffers from anxiety in addition to all of the crap so I usually end up crying and coming out empty-handed. Then I'd visit a private clinic which is expensive, but I'd always get help there. Tomorrow I'm visiting the free clinic but I don't have my hopes up. I don't have any money for the medicine either, right now I've got about 6 dollars on my account.
