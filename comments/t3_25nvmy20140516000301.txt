I'm not talking about the rapist, I'm talking about the woman. The court decides whether there is enough evidence to prosecute the alleged rapist. 

When the police decide that the woman who has come to make a claim is lying, they've bypassed the court system. The court needs to decide if there's enough evidence to say she's lying, not the police.
