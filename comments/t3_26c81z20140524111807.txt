She definitely does feel powerless. My dad has refused to buy her stuff before and she gets really grumpy and upset. She kinda acts like a bad kid who doesn't get a candy at the store. I understand as she's a full grown woman who should decide what she eats herself. 

It's getting worse because she can walk around the house now (although she needs to limit herself) and she can grab her own snacks. Before she would have to ask me to grab snacks for her, and I would grab smaller portions but now she's getting her own snacks. For example she'd ask me to grab her "some cookies" and I'd go grab two for her, she goes to get some herself and usually grabs four. 

She has no concept of what's healthy. She thinks that pretzels are healthy, and while they're healthier than chips, they're still not a healthy snack. A healthy snack to me is a fruit or some veggies.
