It's not a double standard. It's recommendations that are made to protect you, your future child, and the spa's liability. Fetuses and babies are this kind of paradoxical mix of fragile and durable, and sometimes you can drop a baby from a changing table and they're fine but they fall on their backs from a seated position and they're hurt. So not only do we say "Don't leave your baby unattended on a changing table," we also say, "Put a pillow behind a baby who's just learning to sit up." But 99.9% of the time, a baby will be fine in both situations.  

And just as we've gotten smarter with baby safety (think of people in my parents' generation who spent their first months living in drawers or laundry baskets and people in my generation who had those cribs where the side slid down that babies could fall out of easily) we've become more aware of what's risky during pregnancy. It's still up to you to make those decisions for yourself. I'm sure a PubMed search for the different things you want to know about will give you odds ratios and what the risk really is. 

The only thing is that you can't expect someone else to give you what you want when you are in a position to turn around and sue them. For example, if the spa gave you a massage knowing you're pregnant and you miscarried, then you could sue them because they knew massages increase the risk of miscarriage in first trimester pregnancies, so they're going to refuse service to all women in their first trimesters. But if there's something you really want to eat (aside from large quantities of tuna) then go for it, in moderation of course.
