I wanted to breast feed, so SO BADLY. When I had my son, we began nursing as soon as we got to the recovery room (he was a c-section). He took to the breast right away. Unfortunately my milk just didn't come in fully. I tried everything, but he kept dropping weight. I remember when my lactation specialist, a woman whose career was built in teaching women to breast feed, told me "Honey, I just don't think it's going to work for you." My son was three weeks old and damn, I felt like a failure. She brought out a bottle of formula, and my baby downed it like he was starving. He WAS starving. I cried my eyes out; out of sadness and guilt that I couldn't perform the basic task of nourishing my child. 

I continued to nurse him the 1.5 oz my breasts would produce and top him off with formula for 9 months. I loved it... And he loved it.

So yes. Breast feeding is awesome. Sadly some of us just can't make enough milk for our little ones.
