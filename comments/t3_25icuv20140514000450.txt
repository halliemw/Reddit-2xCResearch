1.  I'm assuming that he knew you had a boyfriend
2.  I'm assuming that he noticed you were shy
3.  I'm assuming the he felt empowered by his "status" as the organizer, and by your obvious need for friendship in a new town
4.  Who the fuck just grabs ass?  What the hell?  

Based on these assumptions he's a douchebag and should be punished.  But meh, do whatever works best for you.  Just don't worry about this asshole's feelings whatever decision you come to.
