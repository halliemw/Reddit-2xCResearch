> Something that's not widely understood among us young adults is how we were forced to do all these extracurriculars as teenagers to make our college apps look more "well-rounded." Well, there's a reason being well-rounded is considered appealing, it makes you unique and feel fulfilled. Just because you're an adult now doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to be well-rounded!

Thank you! That is something I had actually forgotten. I did a lot of extracurricular type activities when I was in high school and college and now that I'm working I don't really do that anymore. I never really stopped to think about it but you're totally right that I'll feel more like an individual (rather than just a list of generic accomplishments) if I have something that I actually do. Now it's just a matter of figuring out what that might be..
