Yeah, I was one of those "I won't be happy until I'm skinny" people too. I don't really have any advice for your friend though :( Mostly I just started immersing myself in body-positive blogs and trying to avoid "fitspo." I can imagine that there'd be a lot of pressure to be thin working in fashion.
