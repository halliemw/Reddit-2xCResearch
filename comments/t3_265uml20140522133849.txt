>that could be disastrous to your *family.*

This is a really important point.  She needs to think not just about her marriage, her living situation, and her relationship with her husband... she also needs to think about the effect this kind of thing is going to have on her children.  What happens to the children if/when daddy finds out, mommy and daddy get a divorce, and she has to explain to them why she chose to abort because they heard daddy call her a murderer?  She can choose to abort, but the fallout from all of this could very easily ruin her children's lives and severely complicate/damage both parents' future relationship with their children.  Thinking about it that way, I'm actually more concerned for the children than anything else, here.
