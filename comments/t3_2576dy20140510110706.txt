I wasn't saying anyone cared what criminals want, though that man was an influential circumcision activist for decades before being sentenced for child porn. (His trial for the sexual assault of children is ongoing still AFAIK.)

Did you know that there is no culture on Earth that only cuts girls? Every culture that cuts girls also cuts boys. Why do you think that is? Could it be because the idea that involuntary genital cutting has benefits for one sex has something to do with the same idea for the other sex?

Here's a geographical comparison: [DeMeo (1997) The Geography of Male and Female Genital Mutilations](http://www.academia.edu/4212007/The_Geography_of_Male_and_Female_Genital_Mutilations). Here's lifelong anti-FGM activist, Nahid Toubia's [Evolutionary cultural ethics and the circumcision of children](http://books.google.com/books?id=ljZZ9ZvD_kQC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA1) which explains similarities and differences between genital cuttings. Does her perspective help you understand the issue of involuntary genital cutting better?
