^Agreed.

You're a young adult now, you live on your own, and as such your choices are your own.

You need to let your family know that you care about them, but at the same time you don't share the same beliefs. Let them know that if every time you show up they're going to berate you with talk of how God is punishing you, then you wont be around to hear it anymore. This will upset them obviously, but the reason you have a complex is because of them, and that is something you shouldn't have to deal with.
