Well yeah hence the note that most people won't do perfect use. And imperfect the failure rate is 18%. Condoms' imperfect usage is 15% though (to be fair, imperfect condom usage includes not wearing the thing at all); pills are like 9%. Nothing at all, meanwhile, is 85%.

(I'm getting my numbers from Wikipedia.)

I guess I was just saying that it's not an absolute horror. It's not likely to be used correctly though.
