The first pill I was on made me depressed and exhausted. The first pill my old roommate was on gave her terrible mood swings. She actually broke a few items in our apartment (on accident) before realizing the pill was at fault. Both of us switched, and both of us feel completely normal now on our "new" birth controls that we've each been on for over 2 years. You don't have to give up on the pill completely if you don't want to, but it sounds like you might benefit from a break just to figure out your baseline state and whether you need treatment for depression or it was just the pill talking. It usually takes a few months to adjust to being off the pill, just like it takes a few months to adjust to being on it. The adjustment period may involve an irregular period, so just be aware of that. Other than that possible inconvenience, I don't see any reason you would need to wait until you're back to stop it.
