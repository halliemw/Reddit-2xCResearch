His intent was to do it tonight (I figured) but he got too drunk and came home and passed out. I read his phone (I know its bad but I was desperate, I'd been messaging him the last 2 nights straight, both of which he stayed out at till around 3, without any reply) and found he'd been talking to a local bar-tender.... I really just want to die.

Edit: Also, this is all EXTREMELY sudden. I never in a zillion years expected this to happen. :(
