> The truth of the matter is, we're all so infinitesimally small and fleeting that an experience shared or an experience taken alone matter nothing in the grand scheme of the universe. What really matters is becoming comfortable in your body living with yourself, because there's only one you and you have to live with her.

Thank you, that's really so true. I think part of the reason I stayed so long in my relationship was anxiety about being alone and feeling like I couldn't cope without him. Whether it was my ex who caused me to feel that way or just a part of my own personality I'm not sure, but I guess it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day it's something I need to work on before I even think about getting into another relationship.
