Haha I actually had to change a flat a couple weeks ago on the side of the road. I couldn't loosen the lug nuts so I figured I would just stand on the handle. That didn't work.  I tried jumping up and down on the stupid thing but they wouldn't loosen. I am too much of a lightweight.  >_<

Luckily my dad was there and after having a good laugh he loosened them. But I actually had my share of laughter minutes later when we realized my dad forgot to pull the emergency break...
