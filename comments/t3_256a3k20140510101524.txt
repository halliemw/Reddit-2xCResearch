I disagree. Diaper commercials use the exact same blue fluid, all clear and runny, and it just grates on me every single time I see it on a pad/tampon commercial, because while blue-dyed water may be okay as a urine substitute, the consistency of the blood and tissue expelled during menstruation is very different.
