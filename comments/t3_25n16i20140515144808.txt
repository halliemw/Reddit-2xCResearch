Fair enough! I certainly don't advocate unhealthy relationships, just wanted to share some thoughts that hadn't really been brought to the table as I was reading.

I hope your friend is able to get some support that takes some of the pressure off of you... most likely if she is able to have a healthier state of mind (since it sounds like that's not really happening now), she'll want to choose a healthier relationship. 

I appreciate the friendly response :)
