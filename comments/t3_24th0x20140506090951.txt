Based on past experiences, I think that's a red flag with your boyfriend. You don't deserve any blame in this. You told the guy you had a boyfriend and that should have been the end of it. It's not your fault what the other guy decides to tell you after that. I think it's wrong for your boyfriend to put any blame on you.
