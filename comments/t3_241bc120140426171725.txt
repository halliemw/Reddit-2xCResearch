Yeah we probably shouldn't give critical jobs to people with disabled or critically sick children either - they will want to take too many days off to attend to their needs. Oh, and Drfinitely don't hire anybody with a close family member dying of cancer either - who knows how much time off work they're going to want to "grieve." Go ahead and write off any single parents as well.


Let's also go ahead and scratch off any fat people - they could die of a heart attack at any minute! Diabetics too - plus, anybody with any kind of disability or history of depression - I don't want to train anyone who could potentially off themselves after 3 months on this, oh so critical job.


And whatever you do, don't hire anybody from a poor background - they are way more likely to steal from us or get arrested for something. Prolly should just go ahead and avoid all Mexicans n black people.

Edit: Hopefully everyone recognizes my obvious sarcasm even though the comment I was replying to got deleted for advocating discrimination in the workplace.
