Just treat it as starting for the first time ever, as if you weren't just on the pill two weeks ago. The packet your BC came with should explain what to do. In my case, with mine, I have to wait 7 days before the pill kicks in fully, and use a backup method (condoms) or not have sex until then. Yours will probably be the same, but check anyway. If you've lost the packet, you can always call your pharmacy, they'll tell you exactly what to do.
