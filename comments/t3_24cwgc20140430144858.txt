I agree with /u/alaska_jane that moving in with an ex is probably not the best idea. You say that you don't want to move because of the "good deal" that you have (presumably meaning cheap rent?) but you also say that he is giving you such a discounted rent price so that you can save for a deposit. So save that deposit and move out! It will be better for you in the long run, as the time **will** come that he gets a new girlfriend/FWB/fling/whatever. By that point, you either need to be emotionally ok with seeing him with someone who is not you **or** you need to be long moved out. 

As far as interacting with him, does he initiate any flirting/sexual contact? Have you guys had ex-sex/fooled around/etc since you moved in? If that has happened, and you don't want or can't handle it being no strings, you need to put an end to it. 

It's definitely a tough position to be in but if you are in any way uncomfortable or worried about him starting to date other women, I really think you should find a new place as soon as you can.
