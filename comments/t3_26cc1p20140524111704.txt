> There are dudes that are angry that there is a default subreddit that doesn't cater to their gender.

I like this subreddit and have been curious to see what happens once it became default. The amount of drama (both from the men who are just checking things out and unaware that their "original perspective" is far from it, and the number of hand-wringing "oh god this internet forum used to be so SAFE now it is a CESSPOOL" posts) is sad to see, but it's this concept that makes me think the mods might have known what they were doing. Because you know what? There *should* be a default sub dedicated to women's issues. It's terrible that this draws so much negativity, but there are other spaces to have small, quiet conversations among supportive groups of women. I think it's important that posts about street harassment and abortion accessibility are visible even to people who don't seek them out.
