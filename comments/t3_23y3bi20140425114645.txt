Thank you for posting this. I struggle with my body image every day. I haven't been able to put on a bikini. Maybe one day I can get the courage to do it. I've lost 50 pounds since I gave birth to my daughter three years ago but I'm still not comfortable with the way I look. I'm trying to get back to working out. I had surgery a while ago and it has really hindered my gym progress. I'm going to the gym today though so I'm excited. Anyway, you look great and I hope to have the confidence you have one day.
