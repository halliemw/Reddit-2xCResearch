You sound like me, minus the boyfriend, so I've got that difficulty going for me too! I've joined a Crossfit class that's super big on the community aspect, but I tend to see different people with every class I go to and I haven't really had the chance/been brave enough to strike up conversations with other people yet. So I'm going to happily scavenge whatever tips you get. Just letting you know that you're definitely not alone.
