Ugh yes. The ones where his hands are on her shoulders are a little awkward, like you can kind of see his thought process. "What's do I do with my hands? What do I usually do with my hands? Huh, shoulders are ok. That's normal and not weird. I think I'll do that." The one with the two little girls is kind of cute out of context. But all the ones with the dad's hands on his daughters hips or the hug from behind with his hands over hers or the one where they look like they're dancing really close to each other are just creepy. I guess the dancing one isn't that bad, because that's how the father-daughter dance looked at my parents' wedding because my grandpa had never learned how to dance so it was a lot like a middle school dance: one hand on her waist, her hand on his shoulder, and sway until the song is over. But I don't think he would have chosen to pose like this for a picture given basically any other choice.
