> there's no better way to make a person feel more inferior than telling them they have a condition

My husband has a hard time with this. He has a Bachelors in Psychology and any time I (or anyone else, for that matter) try to talk to him about something, he says "Oh, well I think you have *insert disorder here*". It is frustrating, because I **do** have an anxiety problem, but that doesn't mean that I have everything else in the book, too. And yes, I have talked to him about it. I think it's more of a habit than anything and I know he doesn't mean anything by it, so most of the time I try to let it slide.
