Thanks all for your views. Negative test today. Gonna have a proper chat with my partner about it because although I want children sooner rather than later he obviously doesn't see it in the near future. It's not fair to anyone if we're both not ready. My partners happiness is more important now than my own selfish desires.

Thanks again.
