I've never been asked that question directly but if someone did, and they were rude about it, I would answer, "Why does it matter to you?"

Sometimes it helps among friends to know what a single friend is looking for, so you can occasionally steer hotties toward them. Other than that it really shouldn't matter and is just the person's attempt to label you.

Sounds like that guy who was looking at your facebook pics was interested in you but confused by what he saw online. Hopefully you opened up his eyes when he talked to you about it!
