I've seen her in the flesh twice, once when I met up with him on the way to my flat and they were walking in front on me, none of them said hi. The second was at the weekend and I was drunk, said hi to one of his other friend and ran because I didn't want to be a cunt whilst drunk.

I invite him out with my flat mates/uni friends, but I dont with school friends, these guys dont invite their SOs because we very rarely see each other. The other group are my work friends, none of these invite their SOs either.
