I'm just as lost as you are, so this may be like the blind leading the blind, but since you have the healthy, emotional relationship to back it up, maybe try to put an effort into selling your brain on this and reinforcing positive thoughts (i.e., this is my husband, he loves me so much, he wants to feel close to me, I want to feel close to him, etc.,) and maybe eventually your brain will get on board, allowing your body to follow.  Basically, check and edit your automatic thinking (that you may not even realize is going on and might be stuck on the negative reel from your past), and change it into healthy, supportive, emotional, loving and encouraging dialogue.
