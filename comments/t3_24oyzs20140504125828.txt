I enjoy anime and some other aspects of Japanese culture, but I never realised that there was a 'submissive Asian wife' stereotype to begin with. The Japanese seem more polite in everyday speech than here in Australia but that's the only thing I could mistake for 'submissive.' Where did this stereotype even come from?
