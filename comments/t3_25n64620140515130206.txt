Personally there is that ever-present fear that I might just be looking at a woman who is overweight. I can never tell, so I just avoid the issue completely. What if I did that to a woman and she wasn't pregnant at all? What if I made her feel terrible about herself? Then I get anxious and try to leave ASAP.
