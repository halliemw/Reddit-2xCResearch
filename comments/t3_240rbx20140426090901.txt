Okay, I've never had one in, but I've placed several. 

You can take 400-600mg ibuprofen approximately 30 minutes prior to insertion.(800 mg if your doc says it's okay/you don't have kidney issues/bleeding issues/stomach ulcers). You can also ask if your doc injects anesthetic in the cervix.  Not all will, but especially if you've never had a baby before, it can help. The whole procedure takes less than 5 minutes (if that), even for a first year resident. ;)

Also, make sure you ask your OB/Gyn to let you touch the strings that are cut away, so you'll know what they feel like.
