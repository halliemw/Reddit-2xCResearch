My flow is really heavy. Everyone says I probably won't need to change it more than twice a day. But I easily go through 3 super sized tampons or a handful of regular sized ones on a normal day. I'm going to expect to have to change it more than twice a day. But to me the other benefits make it worth the extra step of rinsing it. I hope it works for me!
