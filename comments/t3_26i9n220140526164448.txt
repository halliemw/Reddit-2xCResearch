What I meant was 'had the child been left unattended for 10 hours, that would probably count as being neglectful since the child is a toddler'. I was working on the assumption that without having specified the duration of the stay to be >= 12 hours, the parent couldn't reasonably have assumed the babysitter 'could' stay the entire time.

It doesn't really apply in this case anyway, since the OP hadn't actually given a 'specific' time frame for they would have to leave.
