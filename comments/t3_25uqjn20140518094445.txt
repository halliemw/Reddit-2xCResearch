So I don't know how I feel about this answer, but as it seems from your second example and your comments that a lot of these guys aren't used to talking to women. Since you're in a position where you're paid to be nice and friendly, some guys are encouraged too far. If only there were some way to convey that they don't have to be attracted to someone being nice to them.
