> I just have to remind you, for the most part when you are marrying a man, you're marrying the family as well. Are you prepared to put up with them for life? Like really put up with them for life? It's a huge commitment and a huge concern.

This is a fair consideration, but I gotta say, if shitty families were a dealbreaker, my husband never should have married me.  Thankfully, we see my family very rarely, which is my choice as much as his.  

To me the keys are: 

* your spouse has fully separated from his/her dysfunctional relatives and does not feel compelled to placate them over you
* your spouse doesn't leave you to fend for yourself if they start in on you
* your spouse makes it clear to everyone that you are a united front and they cannot come between the two of you

I definitely don't think there's anything wrong with not seeing people frequently who you don't really like that much.  It sounds like OP's fiance isn't the kind who placates his family either, so I think OP and fiance can definitely work out an agreement between themselves on how much exposure they have.
