First of all, you shouldn't keep the fact that you are there for her hidden. Maybe she can try martial arts or any other kind of self defence sport where she can also make other friends.
As someone else has mentioned try to help her "weed out" the bullies from her contacts.
Ask her how's she's doing and don't take "fine" for an answer

hope this helps
