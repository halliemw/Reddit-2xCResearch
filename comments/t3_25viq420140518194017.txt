I feel the point is being lost. I could be wrong but I think the point of the blog is not that sisters in real life cases don't look that much alike, it's that Disney, professionals at animation, are making rookie "mistakes". 

Animation isn't bound to biological forces. According to the blog, it's not as appealing to make everyone look alike in a cartoon. I agree with this. Variation is much more interesting to me.

So I think the writer is inferring Disney is sending a message about beauty only having one face. Now that could be a huge assumption, maybe some of you think not so much. This was the origin of my curiosity, which I may not have made clear to begin with.
