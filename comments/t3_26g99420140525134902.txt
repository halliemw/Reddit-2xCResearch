I think the mention of sexual harassment by OP was meant to drive the point home of how serious this unwanted attention towards women in the workplace can really get. The way I read it, I don't think she was equating her experience to those of her friend's, simply relating them. They were all unwanted advances, and really affected the way she looks back at this experience that should have been used for learning and broadening her skills. Instead, it's now a source of disgust.
