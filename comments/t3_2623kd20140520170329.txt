Fellow female engineer, take heart!  You have the same education, qualifications, and chops as all the boys. And this company hired you because of all those capabilities. Don't doubt yourself. I've worked in environments both in offices and in the field where I was the only woman, and I know the feeling your describing. It's tough.  But, like Lynn1975 suggests, be proactive, ask questions, and be bold.
