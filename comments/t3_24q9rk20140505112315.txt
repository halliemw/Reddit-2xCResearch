Has happened to me so many times. I tell the person I'm not interested, I ask them to stop talking to me and demonstrate I mean it for instance putting on head-phones and opening a book or simply walking away. Even at this point, the utter most random "wanna have sex?"-people STILL keep on pushing it and even following you around. 

Until you say "I have a boyfriend". Mostly that gets rid of them. Excepted for a few megadouches who say "Oh, he doesn't have to know - we can go to my place." ><
