How often does that really happen though? I'm looking on the front page, and I don't really see any guy-tailored posts (maybe except sports, which is mainly consistent of men). I feel like it's something that happens from time to time that women notice a lot, and men don't notice much, but I don't think it's a constant thing-- maybe one instance every 5 or 10 pages ... But maybe I'm also wrong because I haven't experienced the tail end of it firsthand.
