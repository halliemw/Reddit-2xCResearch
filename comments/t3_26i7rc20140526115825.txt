I think the issue is that Reddit's admins are in something of a bind as far as attracting women's interest is concerned. 

If they don't do it, and continue to perpetuate a really toxic culture through inaction, then they'll never be able to encourage more women users to feel comfortable on the site and their userbase will have essentially plateaued. No business wants to find themselves without potential for expansion; women are a natural market to expand into.

However.

In order to attract the women users they need, Reddit's administrators will need to put their foot down about harassment and abuse, about rape threats and death threats, and so on... Bearing in mind that the site is essentially founded on an *anything goes* attitude. Remember, Reddit's rules allow for subreddits dedicated to pictures of dead children, to gore, to heroin addiction and crippling alcoholism, to promotion of domestic violence, and many other things that the vast majority of people would find utterly distasteful, if not horrendously offensive. But the nature of the site's construction is that they all have the equal right to exist. It's in the constitution, if you will.

So what does Reddit do? If misogynists are rounded up on principle in order to attract more women users, then so, so much of the website will have to be rounded up on principle in a far more aggressive way. Essentially: if we're going to start taking harassment seriously, then Reddit has to abandon its Wild West approach and begin taking a moral stance of some kind.

I don't claim to believe that either approach is right or wrong; only that it would be a *major* upheaval, and kind of a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation for the administrators.
