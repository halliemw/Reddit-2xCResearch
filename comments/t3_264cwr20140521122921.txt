Red flag red flag red flag!!!

This guy sounds like a jerk who is really good at camoflauging it. His "jokes" don't sound like jokes to me. He's trying to dominate you in a way that seems playful so you won't pick up on it and get defensive. I get the feeling that it'll only get worse as he ages. 

Also, constantly talking about sleeping with other women? That's just plain disrespectful. I mean, human nature is to look around and admire/lust for other attractive people. It would be suspect if he never expressed any indication that he found someone attractive. I mean, I know my boyfriend appreciates a good rack and as long as he's discrete, I don't mind him looking. But he's never mentioned a desire to sleep with another woman, let alone said it repeatedly and in front of other people. 

The way I see it you have two choices:

1. to break up with him because he's a jerk and you don't have to put up with being disrepected and possibly cheated on down the road.

2. Lay down the law and say you don't like what he's saying and doing and if he wants to continue being with you, he'll be respectful and considerate.

Obviously I'm leaning heavily toward option #1, but you're the one in the relationship, you're the one who knows whether it's worth attempting to save and you're the one who knows how he'll react to being told that he's in the wrong.
