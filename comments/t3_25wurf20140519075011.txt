My assumption: You are trying too hard which leads to awkward social quirks. You feel a desperate need to interject in conversation which affects your ability to understand appropriate times to add to conversation. In a public speaking situation you have the floor at all times but not in 99% of other social situations.  Not to be rude but I would bet you talk about yourself too much, and probably just too much in general.  Pay attention to a few things next time you are in a social situation,ask yourself; how often am I talking relative to others in the group, how often am I using the word "I", and finally, keep an eye on the person who says the least...this person is probably the opposite side of the spectrum from you and I'd bet you could learn from this person.  A person who speaks too much is overwhelming and impossible/undesirable to pay attention to.  Someone who speaks less often is more likely to be paid attention to when they do choose to speak, and usually their words hold more weight than those who never shut up.
