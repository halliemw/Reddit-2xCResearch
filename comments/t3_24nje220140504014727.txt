I started my period when I was 9. I was stuck on a toilet for a few hours until my bio father's girlfriend bought me pads. She didn't have any because she had had a hysterectomy. It was terrible. I'm still a bit traumatized. So give the girl pads! Put some everywhere. In her backpack, purse, her dad's house. Everywhere. And teach her how to use them. I didn't get teased that much, I did bleed through some white pants in elementary school. I don't think that my teacher knew much about periods because I would always tell him I was on mine so I could go to the bathroom.
