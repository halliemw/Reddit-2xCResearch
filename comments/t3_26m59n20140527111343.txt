Have you spoken to her about this? It may be that she hasn't realised how often her girlfriend stays round. 

If you're upset enough that you'd move out if the situation doesn't change then I would start looking for other places that you'd be happy to move into. Then sit her down and point out that the two of you are renting together and you don't appreciate having an unofficial third house mate. Perhaps suggest that they split their time 50/50 between the girlfriend's place and yours so that at least half the time you have your own space and time in the house.
