>As an attempt by a man to establish his own bonafides as 'not part of the problem,' so that he feels he has the right to participate in the discussion, rather than being the problem being discussed and therefore being de facto excluded. As the author points out, this is problematic because it still doesn't acknowledge that person's privilege or their subconscious contributions to the larger social problem; but at least it acknowledges the problem (at least partially) and is an attempt to participate.

I see how this attitude can be used by someone to distance themselves from the problem and avoid thinking about it. Nobody likes being labelled *part of the problem,* especially when the implication is that they're "not a good person" because of it. Deflection is a very human reaction.

And, while I don't want to drift into the area of "tone arguments," maybe women's advocates could consider a tactical change? Because the way a lot of debates are structured now, being "sexist" feels like an indelible black mark to a lot of people. Once you're labelled, you're done for life. Whereas, realistically, sexism is bad behaviour that can be consciously changed. A person who did something sexist yesterday can think about their actions and be less sexist today. And, let's be honest here, there's not a man or women on the planet who has not perpetuated or taken advantage of privilege at some point in their lives. It's a culture, it's pervasive. It's the water we all swim in.
