Having white privilege doesn't mean that your life has been free of struggle. It means you're not institutionally discriminated against. You will never have to wonder if you didn't get a job or a home because of your skin color. Or if that cop pulled you over because you're not white. 

(Also some PDs prefer not to hire vets for a host of other reasons.)

It means that as a male you don't have to worry about street harassment, your marital status working against you if you apply for jobs, if you're not in the military or prison, your chances of being sexually assaulted are very low, no one is voting on whether or not you can access reproductive health care, you won't be seen as power-hungry if you want a promotion or meek if you don't. It's about the world outside your own identity that you don't have to experience because of it.
