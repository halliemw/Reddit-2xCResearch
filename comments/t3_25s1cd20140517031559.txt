I Think we should stop putting people into boxes, really. We're so much more than just "women and men", you can't really put 3.5 billion people into the same box.

I know that there is a difference between women in general, and men, in general, but rather than treating these differences as a bad thing, we  should work together :3 

Essentielle, stop alienating the opposite sex.
