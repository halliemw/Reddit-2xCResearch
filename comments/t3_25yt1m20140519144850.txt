I felt like that for a while with my mom, but after my divorce we got closer. I told her I just needed her to listen to me and not say anything sometimes, because I was used to having that one person I talked to all the time. I wouldn't call her my friend, but I wouldn't say we have a bad relationship either.

I don't think your relationship is abnormal. You don't have to make your mom your friend. If you feel a disconnect, talk to her about things she enjoys. Ask her for advice on something like cooking or gardening. What you see from your friends is what they choose to share, and I'm sure some of them have similar relationships with their moms.
