Which is interesting, because fetal alcohol exposure has been called the leading preventable cause of mental retardation and has its own associated syndrome (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder). Opioids are associated with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. Other substances don't have an associated infant syndrome like that. There is WAY more evidence about the danger of fetal alcohol exposure than pretty much any other drug.
