First I was frustrated, then I was like WTF is going on, then I was like well I have to laugh at something otherwise I'm going to SHEHULK SMASH so D:

As an overweight person (among other things) it's one of the last things I ever want to say to someone else as an insult and many of those people found it _funny_. It's unbelievable. It's worse when it's possibly true, even, or they do it knowing something about you and spending a good amount of time playing with you (i.e. raiding), where random people calling me a fat slut doesn't feel nearly as terrible. (I just report that and tell them off.)

Their loss, I'm gonna go help and befriend other people now. :d
