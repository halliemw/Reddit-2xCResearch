I'm big into comic books. So...yeah. 'Nuff said there. I don't bother with comic stores anymore, I just buy digital and off ebay. Which sucks because ideally I'd like to support my local comic stores, but every time I go in it's just an uncomfortable experience all around, what with the posters of half-naked impossibly-bodied women all over the walls and the clerks asking me patronizingly if I'm "really sure that's what I was supposed to buy" because they think I'm running an errand for a boyfriend.
