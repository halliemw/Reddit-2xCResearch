When you say that you both clean yourselves before hand, this reminded me of a problem I had that was very similar to yours. Try using hypo-allergenic soaps. Also, change your laundry detergent to a hypo-allergenic brand (this one helps a lot more than your realize). This was all it took to stop the UTI's from happening. It may not be an infection, so much as inflammation from sensitivity to harsh chemicals in the residue left on both your junk and his, then rubbing it all around while you have sex. Hope this helps.
