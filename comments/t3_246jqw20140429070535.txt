Have you heard of the couch to 5k program?  I've never done it because I can already run a 5k no problem, but some of my friends have and they found it useful.

When I run, I listen to my favorite music and focus on that.  It's also ok to walk or job slower sometimes, too.  Can you run for 15 then walk for 5 then run some more?
