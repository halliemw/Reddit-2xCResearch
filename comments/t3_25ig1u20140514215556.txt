Hi, I am a medical lab tech. A person that examines blood and urine amongst other body fluids in the lab. I strongly recommend you allow your doctor to collect a sample of the discharge. You may have bacterial vaginosis as it does relate to the odor of fish. Or strange smelling. I must also ask you if you had switched body wash soaps or detergents, lotions, other liquids that would pertain to that area. It is possible to be sensitive to these products resulting in what you are currently experiencing. I strongly recommend you revisit your Dr. And let him collect the discharge. It can be analyzed and cultured on special media. This will let the medical scientists know what is causing your problem. Hope this helps.
