Okay, so I used to be pretty lazy. I work two jobs, and I would come home after work, pig out and lay around watching netflix or playing dumb games on my ipad. About five weeks ago I found myself in this hole. I was depressed, sick of my life, and wasn't very fond of most of my friends or boyfriend.

So, after making a couple of new friends who were fresh out of the military, I decided to enlist. I went a recruiters office, and they gave me that hard news that I would have to lose thirty pounds. I was pretty insulted by that, but it has given me drive. It was like the recruiter didn't take me seriously, so I can't wait to call him when I meet my goal weight and tell him I'm ready. 

So instead of sitting around watching netflix, now I watch netflix while I'm at the gym every night after work, and I mean EVERY night, and I get up early and go for a run in the morning.
