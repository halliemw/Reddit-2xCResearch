That's a pretty broad statement, isn't it? It may be a cultural thing, but from my experience Asian cultures remark on weight gain/loss the same way they remark about the weather.  When I see older relatives it's either "oh you've gained weight" or "oh you're getting skinny".  These statements use to cause me so much anxiety, but as I got older I realize they don't mean it in a insulting way.  it's just the same as them pointing out that I'm wearing a blue shirt or a red dress that day.  In their culture the topics of weight is not off-limits, as in Western cultures.
