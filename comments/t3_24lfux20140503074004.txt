Sorry for the slow replies. I posted this right before falling asleep. I studied humanities and cultural studies. My focus is on film and new media. I actually plan on teaching. I want to teach history, but I realized that when I was in school we never got to learn as much about the cultural works of places. I hope I can use film to help teach that.
