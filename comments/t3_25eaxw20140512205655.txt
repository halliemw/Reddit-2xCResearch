Yes - I felt very similar, OP. I felt like I had made this huge mistake and wanted that baby so bad. I hated myself. 

But over time, my hormones calmed down and I was able to see the situation differently. 

I in no way want to dismiss the feelings you're having right now. They are valid. But I encourage you to see therapy to work through some of these feelings; it may help you get some semblance of peace.
