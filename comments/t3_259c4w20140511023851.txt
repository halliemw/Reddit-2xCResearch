Yassss acting major! But yeah, its crazy dealing with people not taking it seriously. I understand classes are easier then an engineering major (to some extent, my acting classes break me emotionally at times) but that doesn't mean you can blow them off. Ugh some of my classmates amaze me that they're still passing and at the school. I'm glad to know I'm not alone :)
