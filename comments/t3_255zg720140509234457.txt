> I'm relatively comfortable with how and what I'm talking to him about, but I am much more in the dark about what to tell my daughter when.

One thing I always think about is how the recipients feel after the last letter/milestone. Maybe you should create a video or letter for your daughter (and for your son) for when she's an old, old lady coming face-to-face with her own mortality after a long life. Also, I always love my parents' stories not just about how they met, but also about their childhoods. For instance, you could tell your daughter about your first visit to a foreign country or your very first date. Who better to satisfy her curiosity on what it's like to be an awkward teenage boy than her own father?

Also, at some point or other, your children are going to face difficulties in their lives (such as losing you). They're going to fail at something no matter how hard they try. You could share a story of an occasion when you didn't succeed. For instance, did you have money troubles, drop out of a college major, or get fired from a job? Did you ever struggle with depression, anxiety, etc.? Your support when they're going through difficult moments will mean the world to them! You'll always be able to pick them up and dry away their tears.
