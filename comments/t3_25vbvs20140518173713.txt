When my sister got married, the first time I saw her dress I didn't like it. It's not that the dress was bad it's just I had pictured something else for her wedding. I didn't say anything to her since she didn't ask, but I might have if she did.

On the day of the wedding I realised I was an idiot and the dress was beautiful and so was she. I'm very glad she never asked for my opinion because if I had said anything I would have regretted it.  Even though it wasn't what I had pictured for her wedding who cares? It was HER wedding, not mine.

Point is your friend probably is regretting her words (assuming she's not stubborn) and definitely will when she sees you walking down the aisle on the day. The wedding is so much more than a dress, and seeing the full picture will help. 

Either way I think the dress is gorgeous and you look amazing!
