I (XY) was at a cookout the day or two before a friend's wedding, and doing the normal parenting stuff you do with a two-year-old.  Pushing on the swing, helping her fly a kite, etc...

I got so many compliments from the older generation about being such a great dad, it was kind of disheartening that people think the bar is set so low for dads.  Of course I'm going to interact and play with my child.
