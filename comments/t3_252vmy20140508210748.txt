Yes, it was primarily that aspect of the LDR that ended things - the not knowing how we would be together on a daily basis. Our visits were always wonderful, but not very representative of daily life. Waiting for a few more years to find out was too risky for him, which I understand. Doesn't mean it was what I wanted though :(
