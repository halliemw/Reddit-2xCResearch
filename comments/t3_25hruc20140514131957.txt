Agreed about the height. Plenty of men are intimidated by tall women, but they're also responding to the women who say they will *only* date a man who's taller than them. And making a bunch of rules about dating is stupid, because people are complicated and surprising.

My dad is 5'4" and his wife is 5'11". They look great together because they're comfortable in their bodies. And super attracted to each other.
