Honestly I do think natural fertility methods are underrated. I've had unprotected sex once and it was a surreal experience: the best feeling I've ever had in addition to fear and guilt. I've been with my boyfriend for quite some time and we're both clean but pregnancy is my ultimate fear. I'll continue to use condoms but I will be less hesitant to go condomless just before or right after my period.
