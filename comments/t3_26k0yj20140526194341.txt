Yeah its frustrating its always in the back of my mind!!! But mirena for me is cheaper than buying protection. My SO and I have saved some money this way and we've been together for a long time and felt this is over all the best decision. And the pain of getting it inserted justifies keeping it in. Others have told me the first year is rough but after that the piece of mind and spontaneity is the best thing ever.
