Who are 'they'? Do they have law degrees? Was it school rules cited as the reasoning or state law? 

If you can't afford a lawyer and can't get help in getting one I would still go to the police and see what they have to say/file a police report. I'd also look into what law offices near you offer free consultations and see if they can offer guidance from a legal standpoint. While a law office likely won't give any legal advice without a retainer, you can still get guidance from them on how to obtain legal counsel under whatever financial situation you have.
