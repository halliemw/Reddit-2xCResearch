Exactly this.  I cannot imagine the pain of losing a child but having to fend off accusations that I did something intentional? That boggles my mind.  And if you do something that could be considered iffy (lunch meat, unpasteurized cheese) and heaven forbid something does happen, would you actually have to go to jail? Appalling.
