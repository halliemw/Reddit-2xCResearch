Thanks for the advice.  I will probably try asking her about it.  I'm nervous because I can imagine her reacting poorly/being really hurtful, but if I don't try, I won't know, and as hurt and upset as I'm feeling, my gut reaction is to run away/avoid.  Which is why I posted in hopes that I would get some other perspectives, because I'm not sure that I'm thinking super clearly right now, due to some other stuff in my life atm.
