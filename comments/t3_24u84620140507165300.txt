Yeah it seemed like they held a certain contempt for the character. But it was directed by Zack Snyder and all of his movies have a certain amount of hubris involved.  Basically he wants to do Superman HIS way. He never lets material just speak for itself.

Have you seen the Redlettermedia review of it?

I actually like Superman quite a bit but man was the movie stupid.
