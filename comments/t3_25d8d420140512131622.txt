This is sad. Its obviously a promotional video. With weight gain, age, and maternity she would obtain what she wanted. My guess is that she is from a South East Asian country where it is "poor" materially relatively. For a physician to use his skills and her to use her resources despite the fact that its $37 for this kind of procedure(I'm sure the surgeon covered the cost) I think is unethical. I'm sure there are plenty of people there and here who could use real services. But plastic surgeons usually paid cash despite there tremendous years of training can not avoid the temptation. Well, at least its not permanent, but I don't know what that substance is. Compared to the orthopedic surgeon(s) who got $1 million kickback for the implantation of unnecessary cervical hardware its not so bad.
