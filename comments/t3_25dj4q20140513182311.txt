You still seem convinced that I am saying something I am not. I am explaining the reasons why a person would say it's a gay thing. This is something that both the guy and OP's friends do. 

For the last time I am not saying that what he did is OK, nor that the gay community would approve of his actions (though many might understand it). 

It became a minor facet of the gay identity, much like reststop hookups. Back then not enough people were out, for gay people to be picky. Some social and ethical concerns went out the window. Like in the starving cannibalism analogy. That doesn't make it right, just understandable. If you want an example of how prevalent this is, read some gay romance. The hookup with the closeted boyfriend is a common trope. It is factually a part of gay culture as it has made it into their pop culture. That doesn't make it right though, and that is the mistake the friends and if we are giving him the benefit of the doubt the gay guy in the story are making. 

All I am really doing is explaining why anyone would assume that this is part of being gay and therefore OK.
