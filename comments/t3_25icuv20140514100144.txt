Polyamory is a thing.  Assuming a woman is 'owned' because she's dating someone isn't really a modern approach to things. 

>He wasn't misinterpreting her body language, he was sexually assaulting her, and you're blaming her?

I'm not blaming her to feel shame, I'm encouraging her to garner the self-confidence to say 'no'.  In a public, safe space.  If someone misreads your body language and hits on you, they have to be told 'no'.  People aren't mind readers.  That said, OP, I'm sorry you felt harassed and I sincerely hope you figure out a good way through this mess.
