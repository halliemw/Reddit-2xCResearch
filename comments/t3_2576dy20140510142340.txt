In terms of your first paragraph, I will take your word on it, the little I know about male circumcision is coloured based on how uncommon it is where I live (I don't know any circumcised men afaik). I appreciate you letting me know that, thanks.

In terms of the second paragraph, from what I understand the idea is that a woman without FGM will get pleasure from sex and be a 'slut', therefore shaming her family and ensuring that no man wants to marry her. In the ocumentary I first linked, many of the teenage boys even believed that, saying the wouldn't want a girl who hadn't been cut as it meant she probably slept around and was a nympohmaniac. They said they would much rather a cut girl because it meant she would only have sex with her husband. Though as you say tradition is also a big part, many uncut girls are told that they cannot tell anyone about it as nobody would give them a job or let their sons date them or anything. 

I think we can both agree, hopefully, that they are both horrific practices and that it's essential that both are stopped.
