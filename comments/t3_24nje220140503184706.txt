I went through a very similar experience as your little sister. My first period was around 9-10 years old, it was between the 4th and 5th grade. I developed breasts much earlier than anyone else in my class and some of the girls in the grades above me. This made them pick on me so I thought that becoming/being woman was a horrible thing. I was incredibly lucky to have an amazing older sister (there's 5 years between us) who helped me through all this womanhood stuff. She was great about it, if I had any questions I didn't feel comfortable asking mom/dad, I could go to her. I remember one day I went home from elementary school due to cramps and I found her at home for the same reason. She had bought battle supplies on her walk back from the high school and we destroyed a tub of chocolate ice cream together. 
Just be there for her. Show her the tips and tricks to surviving that lovely time of the month. Like ALWAYS keeping supplies in the house. I don't know how many times I've had to go to the store with a wad of toilet paper in my panties fearing a bloody nightmare. 

Early onset of puberty in girls has been linked to the relationship with the father. But don't quote me on this, I'm no scientist. Myself and most of my girlfriends who developed early, had shitty relationships with their fathers.

I agree with /u/OnBehalfOfTheState about going to the doctor about this. My sister and I both had a rough time with our periods/puberty due to hormonal imbalances. They only found out about mine because of the issues with my sister during her puberty, they decided to check me to see if there was anything wrong. Good luck :)
