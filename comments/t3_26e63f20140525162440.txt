I live in Poland and I've never even seen a tampon machine. Maybe there is one somewhere in my country but I've only heard of them on the internet lol. So I'm just always prepared. I don't see a problem with always having a tampon or two in my backpack. It's just another item ,,in case of sth'' that I carry.
