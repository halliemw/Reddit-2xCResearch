Ohhhh! OK, so the show is by Bryan Fuller (Wonderfalls, Dead Like Me, Pushing Daisies) so you get this intense visually pleasing world every single time. You can tell that every fabric, every colour, every piece of furniture is so carefully chosen to create a mood, feeling, emotion. it's brilliant.

Second, it's this incredible dynamic between the two male leads that i feel isn't explored enough in tv (the following tried, but hannibal does it better)

And the super intense murder scenes are absolutely breathtaking (if you are ok with some gore here and there)

the psychology factor is extremely intriguing as well. 

I just.. i just love it. the second season really takes off and i must say, it may be the best show on TV.

To give you an idea of other stuff i watch.... game of thrones, arrow, orphan black, shameless

anywho, i highly recommend! :D
