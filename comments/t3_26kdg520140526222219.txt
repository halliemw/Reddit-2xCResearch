for what its worth, i have similar proportions. 

32DD is nothing to sneeze at. in fact its a great size. i have a 32D. 

may i recommend maidenform bras. may have to special order 32DD, but 34D (might be sister size?) are plenty. victorias secret bras sizes are off. i have a bigger cup size in VS bras than in any other brand. 34c doesnt have enough coverage and the cup is not big enough, 32d is too small, 32dd has an INSANE amount of coverage and is too big. it makes no sense.
