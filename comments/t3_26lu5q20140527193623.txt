If you like bourbon and ever find yourself near Lexington or Frankfurt, Kentucky, between October and April consider checking out some of the bourbon distilleries. The tours are pretty fun and they're all free or cheap with samples. 

For me and my lifestyle, I try to focus on sustainability. I'm currently in a pattern that is sustainable and that allows me to continue doing things I enjoy or need to do, including hiking and swimming and helping with the outdoor chores at my parents' and grandma's houses. My occasional pizza binges and steady, small amount of excess adipose tissue (pretty nearly all subcutaneous) isn't getting in the way of my life in any way and it's not impeding my physical ability to continue enjoying the things that are fun and healthy for me. The pattern is not in any way destructive, and it's decidedly sustainable barring any major life changes, at which point my lifestyle will have to change anyway.
