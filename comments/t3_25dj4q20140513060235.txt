Guy with a lot of gay friends here: You're totally right to be angry. Gay people don't get special rules when it comes to who they get to kiss. Being gay doesn't give you a free pass to make a move on someone in a relationship.

I mean, if it had happened to three gay people, it would have caused a lot of shit. What makes it any different when one of the people is a girl?

You have a slutty gay friend who is a jerk.
