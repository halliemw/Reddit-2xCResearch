Im with you on this but i would only consider reconcilling the relationship if he comes to you with the offer he quits drinking. He obviously cant handle it and it is obviously the root cause of all of this drama. I wouldnt recommend you telling him as that might lead to resentment, you could get your sis to plant the idea if you still care about the guy.
