I think the other problem is that feminism has been so demonized that a lot of people are perceived as "crazies" when their viewpoints aren't actually unreasonable. I mean, I guess a lot of people would lump me in with the radicals or "crazies" (I've posted on SRS, I don't shave my legs like hardly ever, and I have a tumblr, OMG) but if you actually talked to me you'd find that my views aren't actually all that weird, even if you don't agree with them. Unfortunately the reddit downvote/death threat brigade doesn't usually let people like me get to the "actual discussion" stage.
