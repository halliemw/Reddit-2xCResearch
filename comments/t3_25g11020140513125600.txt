The thing is, a white, male, able-bodied, heterosexual and cis person, born into wealth never gets the opportunity to show what they can do. Any 'difficulties' they face are minor compared to the difficulties faced by someone who has few of these advantages. I don't blame anyone for being born privileged, but we can never properly evaluate their success, we can never say they deserve what they have.

Intersectionality is real. A white, male, disabled, working class person has different privileges and disadvantages than a black female middle class able-bodied person, but I don't see how that depends on a viewpoint. Those privileges and drawbacks exist independent of perspective.
