Wow, thank you for the lesson in gender-linked traits. I had no idea. Again, you've entirely missed the point.

This isn't about being "fair". I never used the word "fair". So don't mis-quote me.

What the issue at hand is is that women with body hair are regarded at unfeminine. (re: "gross") Shaving in the modern sense is relatively new. How much time do you think humans were around while women didn't shave at all? Were women unfeminine then? It's incredibly naive to say that "men prefer this, women prefer that" and not even bother to ask why or if that's really even true.

I'm talking about addressing critically the way we think about gender, bodies, and what traits are deemed "acceptable" by society, which has obviously shifted vastly throughout history and is constantly in flux. By your statements, you know nothing about the power and influence of social pressures on people. You can't just use hypothetical situations to describe reality. It's not a conspiracy by razor companies, it's a cultural mindset. People think they have to think a certain way because others do, and it's human nature to not want to be the odd one out. The only way we can be active participants in our world is if we hold up a mirror to ourselves, our behaviors, and ask ourselves why we do and think those things. There is no other way to make progress. Saying something just "is the way it is" is truly passive and honestly dangerous. There are many clear instances in human history that demonstrate this.
