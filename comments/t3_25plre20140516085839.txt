I'm interested in reading suggestions here, speaking as a member not a mod.

The first thing I thought was maybe something like an AskReddit-style "serious" tag, because I like the way that has worked in that community.  But what would the tag say, and what would it ban exactly? I still think some kind of tagging could maybe work, but my brain just isn't coming up with anything.

Prior to the defaulting, we weren't particularly strict about sending people to other, more-specific subs with their posts.  Many posts were maybe better-suited to AskWomen or Fashion or Mommit, but the posts worked and the community worked with them.  Would it be better to redirect more now?
