Where she addresses the statistic you have posted:

>Even at early fetal testing (known as chorionic villus sampling), 99 percent of fetuses are chromosomally normal among 35-year-old pregnant women, and 97 percent among 40-year-olds. At 45, when most women can no longer get pregnant, 87 percent of fetuses are still normal. 

Where she already made your other points:

>Having children at a young age slightly lowers the risks of infertility and chromosomal abnormalities, and moderately lowers the risk of miscarriage.

If you read the article, it certainly doesn't seem like you understood it.  Beyond an ad-hominem attack, you haven't disputed any of the statistics or studies she actually cited, or pointed out anything she said which was actually wrong.
