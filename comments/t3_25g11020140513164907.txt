So you draw up a hypothetical situation and then conclude with "they have only half as many options as a white person" based on your hypothetical situation. Say both candidates are white and the same situation applies. Then what? Blame it on eye color? what if the black applicant received more offers? Are you saying or implying that outcome is impossible?
