this sounds like it could be part of it. they're probably jealous of your figure and youth. woman at my office say the same things. i had hummus the other day and one woman walked in and yelled "that looks disgusting!". if anyone buys junk food and i turn it down they say "you can afford to eat it! you're skinny!", uh, sorry i don't want to eat my weight in sugar?

I had a wrap with veggies once and someone scoffed at me and said "what ever happened to peanut butter and jelly?!" like they were offended i didn't eat the same gross shit they shove in their mouths. it's most likely nothing you're doing, and all about them. they probably want to make you feel excluded because they're threatened by you some how. i know it's hard but try and take it as a compliment.
