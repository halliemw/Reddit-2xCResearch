Agreed. Tell your professors. I experienced something similar when I went to college. I told my professors. Some let me make up tests. Others advised me to take some time off. I thought taking time off from school would mean I was a failure, that nothing would turn out right, but it also ended up being an okay option for me. Whatever happens, your mental health is the priority. Everything else can be solved.
