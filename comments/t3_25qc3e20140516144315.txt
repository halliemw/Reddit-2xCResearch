The only suggestion I can offer would be learning to sew so that you can take in the lower part of shirts and blouses that fit comfortably over your chest. It would be time consuming until you became practiced, but far less money than paying someone else to tailor your clothes. This works best for button ups, but can also be used to make tees more comfortably form fitting rather than either baggy or too tight with the perpetually stretching neckline.
