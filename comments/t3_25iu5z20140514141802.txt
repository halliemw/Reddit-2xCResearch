I've been in your shoes before on 2 occasions. One of these guys I know despise so much that he makes me physically ill and I felt so ashamed and guilty for hooking up with him. I was lonely and thought that men and sex could fill this void in my life. "I'm having sex! Men are giving me attention! Lonely people don't get laid, right?"

 It took a lot of self reflection and a lot of thinking for me to realize that meaningless sex was not going to make me happy. I'm in a better place now and I'm with a man that loves me so much that it baffles me sometimes. When I think about those events I'm sometimes still a little embarrassed and I still regret it, but it gets less and less as time goes on.
