That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it? Obviously a lot of this depends on what we're calling slut shaming or misogyny. But lets say a group of people decide they actively look down on women who sleep with lots of people. They "slut shame" somehow. Does that mean they hate women? I don't think so. 

It seems like saying if you hate football players, you hate men. You hate an aspect of them (that they play football, or something), so you hate men. Disliking a part of who someone is or something that some of a demographic does, doesn't really equal hating them in general, I think. 

(I chose football because I was trying to think of a very male-dominated sport or activity)
