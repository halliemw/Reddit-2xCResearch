i second the posture thing. also do chest exercises, dumbbell bench presses, 10 lbs or so. it works the muscles under the boobs and makes them perkier. 

also, what guy doesn't like boobs?? 

as far as surgery, don't let anyone tell you otherwise if its what you want to do. i had a similar boob situation (lopsided, totally asymmetrical chest wall, literally had one boob) and hated myself, bras, sex, everything. everyone - and i mean EVERYONE who i mentioned this to - was like oh, you look fine (i stuffed pretty well)! or "it'll even out after you have kids" or "gain some weight!" or "oh just learn to love yourself!" 

fuck that. fuck those people. you know you more than anyone else knows you. if you want to get surgery, do your research, make an informed decision about type and size. it's worth it. pretty sure you can put them on credit, too. if you want to chat about fake boobies, send me a message :)
