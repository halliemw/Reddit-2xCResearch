I took mircogestin for a little over a month.  
Started coughing up blood.  I thought it was just sinus drainage and ignored it. 
Then one day I woke up to sharp pains in my lungs. I couldn't move for the pain.  I figured I had pleurisy and was getting pneumonia.  This led me to urgent care which led me to a pulmonologist. 
They took a CT and told me I had pulmonary emboli. More than one.  Both lungs.  I was admitted to the hospital for 5 days. 
I also had nodules in my lungs which turned out to be necrosis.  My lungs were dying from blood blockage. Pain. I had to have a 3 foot needle stuck in my lungs to biopsy this. 

All in all, they couldn't find a reason for me a non smoking 22(2 yrs ago) year old to have this diagnosis.  Test after test after test came up negative.  The ruled it down to the BC. 

It's all gone now but not forgotten.  God knows the medical dept collectors haven't forgotten. 

Be careful with BC. Pay attention to your body and what it's telling you.

I can't take hormones ever again without the risk of reoccurrence. I have tried the IUD but my non child experienced uterus wads it up. It's condoms from here on out and I hate it.
