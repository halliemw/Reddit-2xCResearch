Exactly.

Although I agree with you and what your friend is doing, I'd much rather close the case as soon as I can. That's a personal choice for me though, and here is why. He knocked up a girl after me, and they are also no longer together. I like her. She's nice. She also does not have the AMAZING boyfriend I have, and she's struggling. I want her to get as much money from him as possible, because she needs it more than I do. That's another reason I don't take him to court for non-payment. If he is in jail, he's not working, so she isn't getting help from him. The only reason I even have a case open is because I am required to because I;m on medicaid and food stamps. I'm poor, but I wont be for long, and I have an amazing support system she doesn't have. 

I loved the point you made, and I have thought about it before A LOT. I could send her to college with that money. I could save more money. It doesn't matter how much or little I make, or how much or little he makes. It's about doing your part to raise your child. 

SO no, even though I 100% agree with you, I'm not going to keep taking it and will close the file as soon as I can afford to, but for anyone to suggest that I should not ask for child support, simply because my boyfriend (not, husband! Not officially the father of my daughter, yet) makes money, is upsetting. My boyfriend helps when we need him, because he loves us and is a good person. People who take the attitude that my daughter is his responsibility as much as it is her father's, rubs me the wrong way. 

EDIT: And, for the record, I really would like to think that if my daughter want's to go to college, I will do what it takes to send her there. She might not mean much to her dad, but she means the world to me, and I will bend heaven and earth to make sure she has a good life.
