My personal opinions, so take them or leave them:

1) Stay out of the red pill.  Honestly, I doubt any good would come of it.

2) A 30-year-old who feels young is more attractive than a 24-year-old who feels as old as the hills.

3) Being 6'3" definitely changes the dynamic, but doesn't mean you can't find a guy. You might have to be more direct with guys, as they often assume a taller girl wouldn't be interested in them.

My girlfriend is a decent amount older than me, but she has vitality and a lust for life.  Before meeting my current SO, I went on a few dates with someone who was my age (roughly 30).  However, that person would NOT shut up about how old she felt.  It was a major turn-off and helped me to see her as "old" as well.  I'm a firm believer in the whole "you're only as young as you feel" thing.

I'm sorry you're having a rough time.  It's okay to feel bad sometimes.  However, as others have pointed out, you're no old hag!  30 is not old by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, most of the people I've talked to about age say their 30s were the best years of their lives.
