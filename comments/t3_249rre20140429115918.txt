I like ceremony, too, but I prefer ones where I'm not figuratively marrying my father. If a purity ring is something your daughter would like, then I think it would make a lovely birthday gift, even at 12. But I think a ceremony that closely resembles a wedding to your father is a little much and a little creepy. Father-daughter dances, great, purity rings, ok, but the type of ceremony involved? Way too close to a wedding and way too involved in all their future sexual decisions.

When you're 12, you don't really have much of an option when your parents suggest something like this, and even though it isn't designed to be something they're pressured into, I would be surprised if a large portion of the girls don't feel like they have a choice. I also knew some people who were sexually active one way or another, but for most of my school, kissing and making out with clothes on was as far as it went. Most of us were very curious about sex and our sexuality was developing, but we weren't anywhere near ready to have it even by our own standards. And based on what I've heard from a younger cousin, that hasn't changed much. Sure, most of them know about porn and how to find it, but porn is not sex.

In any case, I don't think this is really appropriate at any age because it will always have creepy connotations. I do agree that this whole emphasis on sex, and only PIV sex for many people, as the measure of "purity" and "goodness" needs to end. No one wins this way.
