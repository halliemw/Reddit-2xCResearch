Sorry, professionals don't treat this problem!  (He was in treatment and obviously was misdiagnosed and *not* actually treated)  This is not garden variety mental illness.  It's *CRIMINAL* insanity to want this and plan a murder spree for basically no specific reason.  It's moral and personal bankruptcy.  It's the opposite of what someone could plausibly use as a not-guilty plea.

Psychopathy is not treatable.  Trends and movements that feed it are criminal, they normalize hate and destructive thoughts.
