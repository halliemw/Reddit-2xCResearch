I think that the reason there aren't more "female" oriented topics posted in /r/Lawyers is that many women aren't willing to publicly self-identify. Fortunately I haven't dealt with any bad experiences despite being pretty open about being a woman, but I know not everyone can say that. My only concern with your approach would be--what if a troll infiltrates on trust and then outs women in other parts of reddit? But maybe that's paranoia. I get that my tiny new subreddit probably wouldn't be the immediate target of anybody. But then I don't really understand troll behavior in general.
