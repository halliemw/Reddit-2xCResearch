Yes please read that book! Read the excerpts RIGHT NOW. I am a fellow pregnant lady and this is the only pregnancy book I have read. It encouraged me to read actual medical studies and look at actual risk levels of things like listeriosis. My husband is a physician and has been so so so supportive of me choosing my choices and thinks most of the "don'ts" list is insanely overly cautious. As a nurse when you start digging deeper into the data behind the pregnancy rules, you'll probably feel the same way. 

This is your pregnancy, make your own choices, and don't ever let anyone make you feel like you're a bad mom because you ate a turkey sandwich. Do what feels right for you.
