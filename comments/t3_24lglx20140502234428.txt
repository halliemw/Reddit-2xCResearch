I wish I had advice to give, unfortunately I don't, but I wanted to tell you that you aren't alone. Male eating disorders are still very "hush hush" and, in my opinion, completely understudied, underfunded, and under-discussed. But they are very real.

My husband has an unnamed, untreated eating disorder. He does not purge, to my knowledge, but he is extremely selective in the foods that he will eat (I can count the number of foods he will eat on two hands), and he frequently goes a day or more without eating. He has no desire to lose weight (nor does he need to), and he doesn't seem to have any issues with his body. He swears he just doesn't get hungry, but when I encourage him to eat, it becomes a battle. Trying to get him to try a new food is similar to asking someone to face their greatest phobias. He recognizes it is a problem, but cannot verbalize his thought processes or issues when it comes to food. Our daughter is at the stage where she wants to "feed" us the way we feed her, and he gets a look of pure terror on his face when she tries to "feed" him a food that isn't on his "list". 

We've tried to discuss this with a doctor, and they pretty much dismiss it as nothing. But it isn't nothing, it's debilitating and it interferes with his life and our family's life together. I'm frightened for him and what it could be doing to his body, and I have no idea how to help.

My thoughts and prayers are with you. I hope you and your boyfriend are able to find some help.
