Thank you for pointing out this comment.

I had never heard of this sub until it's default either, and being a "soon to be 30" guy with little to no women in his social circle i ventured here to "broaden my horizons", but the first two days i only found reasons for why i should be ashamed to be a guy, every comment i made was dismissed while everything i commented on was upvoted to high heavens.

In short my first understanding was that the only true equalizer between humans of any description is the tendency to "circlejerk".

All in all a net positive, i've stopped viewing anyone above and/or below anything, and gained a more profound understanding of what it's like being addressed solely on one's gender, and i did come here to gain a better understanding of sexism after all, was just a surprise to see how much i too was programmed to view sexism as a one way street, and how devious the trappings are when faced with such a situation, in all raising my esteem for fair mindedness and the promotion of understanding, which do thankfully seem to be universal concepts.
