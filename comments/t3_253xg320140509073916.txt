Don't sweat it! My wedding was approximately the same size...probably less than 50, actually. 

We purposefully had no brides&groomspeople. We didn't want people to have to spend any extra money on clothes and et ceteras after they had to spend the money to travel. We handled it like this: we had friends, family, and others walk down the aisle to a fun song we'd chosen for the group who would have been the probabe party. Couples and close friends got to walk together instead of having to be paired with a stranger. It worked out nicely and people had a good time with it.

Also, you can do whatever the flip you want. We had a Halloween wedding in our back yard. Dogs were invited. People came in costume. We put birthday candles in our wedding cake because it was my grandma's birthday. We cut the cake with someone's costume sword. We read our vows off of an ipad. We got pretty much everything off craigslist and from thrift stores, or made it ourselves. I forgot my bouquet when I walked down the aisle. It was all a lovely clusterf*ck, stuff went wrong, people had a good time, and even the most conservative and traditional of relatives made a point to say they really enjoyed themselves. 

Just have fun and do exactly what you want with it. If you wanted everyone you knew to just come over and lay around and read with you on that day, they would probably do it.

Good luck!
