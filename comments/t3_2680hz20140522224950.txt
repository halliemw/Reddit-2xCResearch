I feel like this approach would work better for me than the current if I were single. At least in that situation I would know that the guy respected me enough not to pressure me into dating without prior knowledge of me or my personality.

Kind of relevant from an earlier reply
>When I first met my boyfriend, romance wasn't even a thought for a while. We established a friendship that was sincere, and the comfort that I felt with him in the process actually allowed me to be the one to propose a more romantic relationship. Not feeling pressured to "force" our relationship to work before we got to know one another established a foundation that allows us to have a very healthy and honest relationship to this day.
