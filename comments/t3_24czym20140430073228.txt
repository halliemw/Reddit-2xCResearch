If you wear it more often, people will stop commenting. A lot of the time, people don't think about what they say in such great detail and analyze the words not to mention anticipating the reaction that it will have on the other. The people who comment are simply reacting to a change in their environment and they aren't realizing how much their words affect you, probably because they don't comprehend your feelings about makeup or your appearance that day. As far as they're concerned, it's a big change and they aren't used to seeing you in that way. They are just commenting to make conversation since they can't very well say "I see you are wearing makeup today" and leave it at that. They feel like they have to say something. I get it too, I just say I want to do this, or I just felt like it. If you don't wear makeup ever and then do, what IS the occasion? :P Just try to think about it from their perspective and you'll realize it doesn't matter. Be you, and they will be them.
