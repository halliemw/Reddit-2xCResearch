Part of the reason IFF came about is that when we allowed images everyday we also tried to only allow images that were related to being a woman. Which.. well, it was really fair to the users and we as mods had a hard time drawing that line. IFF is for any woman to post any image that's important to her and her life. That's up to them to decide, not us as moderators. 

Saying that we shouldn't allow photos of women feeling more confident due to changes in lifestyle because some think that they shouldn't be proud of that? I'm sorry, no, we won't do that. Those types of photos have been here since the beginning of 2xc.

>I thought this sub was better than that.

That's a really strange line, it's like you're shaming the women posting those images for caring about that stuff? A lot of people do care about that, and that's okay, good even. It is okay to want to be a healthier person or to change your appearance and be happy about the results. 

We've always been a space for women to celebrate their achievements regardless of what they are, and we will continue to do so. Not make judgements on whether their achievements are up to snuff or not.
