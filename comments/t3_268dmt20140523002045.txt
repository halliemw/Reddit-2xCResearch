I am the same way- although I can use tampons I'm just lazy on my period and stick to pads when I'm home. I started shaving down there occasionally, and then when I got my period after I have shaved, it was a glory-hallelujah moment. So much easier to clean. It's interesting to hear other ladies' perspective though!
