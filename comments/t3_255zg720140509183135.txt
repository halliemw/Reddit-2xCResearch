I keep trying to convince her to see a counselor, but she is pretty against it.  In her words "I just start crying the moment I go in there."  I try to tell her this is exactly why she should go to see a counselor, but she keeps finding reasons not to go.  I think this is part of her ignoring what is happening.

As far as the kids go, I have them meeting with a counselor at their elementary school - building a good relationship with them so that they will have support when they need it. 

Both our families are close, but again, my wife is pretty solitary, so I don't know how much she will utilize them.  I just keep giving her any time she wants with her friends and/or family so she can build up that support network in a way she is comfortable.
