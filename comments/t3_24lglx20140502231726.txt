A normal reaction is to compliment him. But please! Don't tell him how much you love his body.  I know this seems backwards, but placing more emphasis on his shape will not help. 

My best advice is to call a doctor to ask for help. Bulimia is an illness, and a serious one at that. 

Another thing to try is to maybe cook a very light and healthy dinner and then plan something immediately afterwords, like going on a walk. He'll not only be satisfied by consuming few calories, but he'll get enjoyment out of the exercise with a loved one. 

But the second option is temporary. The first is what you need most it seems. I hope it all works out for the best.
