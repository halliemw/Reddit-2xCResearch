I was in your exact situation, over 6 years ago when I was 19 and got pregnant by my on/off SO. I never really thought about being a parent, but abortion never crossed my mind. 

DON'T stress about labor and delivery. No matter what, that is endgame. All you can do is prepare yourself as much as possible, so EDUCATE YO SELF. I'm guessing that you aren't that far along, so you have a while to mentally prepare yourself for it. Also, your body is going to change. I had an eating disorder when I became pregnant, so for the first few months it was very hard. I was put on all sorts of supplements  to gain weight and be healthy. Eventually, something just clicked and I started taking care of myself. I got stretch marks, I gained weight, I felt unattractive. Something that made me feel better was that whatever happened to my body, I was doing it for my baby. I started feel better about my weight and stretch marks because that made me feel like I was doing it right and my baby was growing the way she was supposed to. You just have to take care of yourself, and in turn you will be taking care of her. 

As for school, you're only 19! I'm 26 now and I'm finishing up my BA. I have a full time job and can support my daughter. We're not rich by any means, but I'm getting there. You'll need your family's support if you're doing this alone. 

Please PM me if you want to chat. Being a young mom is hard, good luck. :)
