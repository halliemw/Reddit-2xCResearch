> I never said mental illness, I said impact (i.e change).  

You said "a waiting period makes sense from a mental health perspective." Meaning you think patronizing women and assuming we're all capricious idiots is better for their mental health than allowing them reproductive freedom. 

> There are few important decisions that can be made in an instant, if a person can abort on a whim then the religious groups may for once have it right.  

THAT's the condescending part I was just mentioning. To assume that any woman who goes for an abortion hasn't thought it through from every aspect that matters to her is sickeningly paternalistic. Repeat after me: Women are not stupid children. We are adults and deserve to be treated as such. Which means we get complete and autonomous control over our own bodies, even if we're making decisions you don't like.
