What is the curriculum mandated by your city school board or state/province? If they're supposed to be teaching you comprehensive sex ed and they're not they could get in trouble if you complained to a school board trustee. However, if you're in an abstinence only state I don't know if there's much that you can do to change this outside of complaining to your parents and seeing if they can write a strongly worded letter.
