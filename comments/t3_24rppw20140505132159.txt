Back in the early 60s, Daddy-Daughter dances were a thing at our church.  But no way did anyone call it a Purity Ball or mention sexuality.  It was assumed the girls would remain virgins until marriage.  It was more of a celebration, a way to learn formal social graces before beginning to date.  A different era.

But yes, those portraits look awkward at best.  I live in Utah where we still see too many child bride unions (yes, illegal), and these photos smack of that.  I'd guess they were taken in Southern Utah, except for the cross in the one, Mormons don't use crosses.  That, and the dresses are too modern.  Still, serious creepy factor.
