I certainly hope at the end of everything she can live with the choice and feel it was correct or come to terms with it in some fashion. I thought very similar thoughts to OP until a friend very bluntly, although offhandedly, said "you're f-n hormonal." 

That one statement really hit me square in the face and put everything into perspective for me. After that, it became so much easier. I should have seen a doctor, or talked to someone about it. I bottled it up and it took a dear, beautifully honest friend to shake me awake. 

OP, I wish you the very best in the future and I promise you, as someone who has been there, life does indeed go on. It's different, and it takes time but this can be a beautiful learning experience. It's a harsh one but I gained a large self awareness through my recovery. Good luck. Don't bottle it up.
