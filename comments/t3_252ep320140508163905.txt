I was ten and while I vaguely knew what a period was, it wasn't something my mom or school had talked to me about yet. One night we were out with friends and I kept complaining about a bad stomachache. The next day, I woke up with ruined underwear. 

I knew it was blood but I had no reference for what it could be, so....I naturally assumed I was dying. I was too afraid to tell anyone, so I just cleaned up and went about my day. Later, my mom yelled at me over something trivial and I burst into huge, hysterical sobs. Finally, I choked out that I was dying and she figured out what was going on. 

She felt so bad for not preparing me and for yelling at me, she went out and bought me a Spice Girls CD, haha. Overall, it was pretty traumatic so I've vowed that if I ever have daughters, I'll educate them early!
