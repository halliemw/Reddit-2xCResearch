From both friends' and my own experience, I can honestly tell you that it doesn't matter what you wear. Some people will still sexually harass you without provocation. Also, I'd just come from work. I hadn't been planning to leave early and go to the neighborhood originally, so I didn't bring a male escort or a "safe" change of clothes. It was a spontaneous thing. And besides, I shouldn't have to make special plans when I want to walk down a street. That's ridiculous. 

Lastly, the experience wasn't scary. It has little to do with fear. It was broad daylight, there were plenty of people out and about, cars driving by--there's no way they could have actually raped or hurt me without the entire neighborhood seeing. But I was shocked by the fact that apparently I forfeit the rights to my own body when I walk past certain people on the street, that people can turn me into just some sex object and I can't do anything about it. It's not always about fear, it's about violation. It's about having a right to my own body and about how upsetting verbal and physical harassment can be. It makes you feel insecure, embarrassed, useless and vulnerable... but I'm not a timid person, and I'm not afraid to go back into that neighborhood again. Harassment doesn't always cause fear, but it does cause emotional pain and trauma. I just wanted to clarify what my experience was. Maybe I didn't emphasize that enough.
