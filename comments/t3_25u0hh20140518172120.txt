i find it delightful when gender roles break the other way. when you find women who are working hard to pay for a stay at home father. when you find a woman who changes a flat tire for a guy who doesn't know how to do it. when a woman risks her life to save a helpless man who is in danger. why don't we toss these things into the media as well? its as if we have different expectations of people simply based on their gender or something.
