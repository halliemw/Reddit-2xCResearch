A family friend of mine works as a teacher's aide for special needs education (in the US at a high school) and has to deal with this very often. She works with severely disabled teenagers who often become violent and frequently act out in both nonsexual and sexual ways. She's groped, pinched, felt up, etc on an almost daily basis, and frequently the parents are enraged when she reports the student's behavior. 
She's a Type I diabetic with an insulin pump, and she has had students grab the pump and jerk on it as well.

Whether or not he knew what he was doing, *you* still experienced it. You can be assaulted without the perpetrator knowing what they are doing. It doesn't change your experience whether they're mentally capable or not. So don't ever feel like your complaint was invalid - you have a RIGHT to not be assaulted.
