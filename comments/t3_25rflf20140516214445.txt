It's all about communication. You might consider letting him know his "opinions" are bordering on implicit "instructions," if that's how you feel, and telling him it *has to change* this time around, or else. If I kept on receiving unsolicited advice that doesn't even have the potential to affect the quality of my life in some way, I would tell that person to knock it off, regardless of whether I'm in a relationship with that person or not.
