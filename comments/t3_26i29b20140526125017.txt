He said it first, about two months into our relationship, and it was a huge relief because I kept being afraid that it was going to come out of my mouth, and that it would scare him off because of how early in the relationship it was.  I'm pretty sure that I knew within the first week of us dating.  We've been together for the past 7 years, and married for 3, so I guess I wasn't wrong!
