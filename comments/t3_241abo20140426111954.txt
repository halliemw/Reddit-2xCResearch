We are social creatures, we're not meant to be alone, but it is good to be a little comfortable with it.  Also, you're probably still adjusting to the loss of the relationship, even if it wasn't a good one, and that magnifies the feelings of loneliness. It will get easier!  If you're working on meeting new people, that's great! Keep doing that.  It will get you out of your head a little and I think the hope of meeting new people that we really click with while we're alone, can make the lonely times a little more bearable.  Also telling yourself that you won't be alone forever and this is just a temporary time can keep things from hitting you too hard.  Practice being alone while you read, watch movies, listen to music, pick up a new hobby/skill/language etc. and talk to your family on the phone.  Balancing the alone time with socializing makes both easier. Remember that you're going through a lot of stress right now, but it sounds like you're moving in the right direction.
