*hugs* I saw this unfold on the local subreddit. I wish I could offer to take off Monday to be there for/with you before and after but I'm absolutely barred from taking off any time off next week :( I can usually take off between noon and 1PM for a lunch break though, so if you need company around that time and you happen to be around downtown/Old Town, shoot me a PM! I completely understand how court can be scary even when you've done nothing wrong.

I've worked in a law office before though not as an attorney, but one piece of advice I've heard from there is to start all your answers with a big, deep breath. It stops you for just a moment and lets your get your head on a little straight, which reduces the chance of going straight to rambletown (which is what I do too!). I agree that bringing something to fidget with is a good idea, whether it's a paperclip or even just a ring you can twirl on your finger.
