I get what you mean. It can become overwhelming or tiring even if the guys involved may be meaning to be flattering or just want to strike up a conversation/whatever. I do try to keep in mind that society presents the idea that guys are supposed to ask women out and that individual guys have no idea how many times a woman may have been asked out or what her experience is. I think those one-off "I asked out this girl at a bar and we're still together ten years later!" stories add a bit of fuel to the fire. 

Douchebags like the guy who started sexting you don't make it easy, though. :/ The only thing I can think of is to not bother messaging them unless they showed an actual interest in getting to know you beyond 'hey want to go out sometime'. That way there's at least something to go off of.
