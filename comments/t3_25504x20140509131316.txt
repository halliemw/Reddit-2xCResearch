Actually I think it would be great for a wedding guest book. As long as you take the picture from the right distance (I found if I'm closer than a metre, it will blur - however, even if it does blur, it still looks rather good). I have only found one album online that will fit them and it isn't attractive, but if you stick it into your own book i.e. not a proper album, it would look awesome. In my opinion. 

I really like the camera, I was given it and it is a lot of fun. And it's awesome watching it develop from white into a picture! I'd recommend getting one and trying it out before the wedding, to see how you personally like it. It is a very satisfying feeling taking a picture with it.
