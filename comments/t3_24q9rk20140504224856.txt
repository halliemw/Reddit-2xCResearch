I don't think that all the dudes that yell things from cars (the most common form of street harassment around here) would be threatened by the presence of a man, or my more diminutive male friends, and yet any male presence deters them nonetheless. They also seem to genuinely feel bad if they notice a man, but not if you look or say you are offended. It mostly has to do with disrespect, not fear.
