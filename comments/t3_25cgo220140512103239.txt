I had a pretty rough day yesterday (PMS is real), and at some point or another in the day I cried over every possible topic. Weight, work, school, relationship, health, getting ready to move, family being family. In exactly one month I'll be on the road to Bonnaroo. It'll be my fourth time, and I can't wait to leave the real world for a few days. Actually, just typing that out made me feel better.
