It's weird to me that the first half of this article is all pile-on circle-jerk in mocking and making fun of men falling into the simplified 'not all men' meme, and the second half of the article actually discuses the use age of the true argument in a thoughtful way, and concludes that it's probably a positive development representing actual progress in the overall level of debate.  I like the discussion in the second half a lot, but it's somewhat bewildering to me that someone who would be willing or able to think about the topic in such detail would also be applauding such derisive, vacant memes.

I guess I always want to rise above and give reasoned arguments, rather than turning the tools of the assholes against them and operating on their level; but I guess I can't expect everyone to work that way.
