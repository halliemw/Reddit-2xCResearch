Who told you you had a "condition"?  Was it a doctor?  Because if this was a self-diagnosis, you should know the plastic surgery industry makes up all kinds of terms, faux-classifications and plasters it on the internet to make perfectly healthy and attractive people feel bad about themselves.  I bet you look better than you think.  The fact that a google search only led you to before/after pictures (hint: those are adverts) makes me suspect this.  goodluck.
