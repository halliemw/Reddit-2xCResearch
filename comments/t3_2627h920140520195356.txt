I would disagree with that in some circumstances. This is totally subjective but it absolutely depends on the maturity of the 13 year old. I grew up in a military family with a retired infantry father who taught me bits and pieces of self defense since I was 8 and for my 13th birthday I got a tazer, pepper spray and a kubotan. At 13, I fully understood that these were not toys and these weren't things to take out and show my friends or things to take at all unless I felt like I was in danger. I realize that this girl is raised different, but I do think that after she takes a self defense class and taught some serious defense lessons that she should be able to carry pepper spray, obviously you're gonna have to make sure that she knows to NEVER take these things to school. One thing I've learned from my father is to always use the buddy system when possible. Please teach her that, even if it is another 13 year old friend. I think after suitable training and education that she should carry pepper spray, yes you can hurt  people with it, but there's not much risk for seriously hurting or killing someone with it. Maybe she could carry a kubotan? I don't know, i would rather have my daughter have the confidence knowing she had something to defend herself. It's not so much the ability to defend yourself, it's knowing if you absolutely had to, you have a chance. I'm not a parent or anything so please take this with a grain of salt. I tend to sort of agree with not giving a 13 year old pepper spray, but I also think that if she receives education and self defense classes on the matter that it would be ok. Also be sure to factor her in her maturity level.
