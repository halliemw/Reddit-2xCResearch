I have excessive hair on my belly and a lot of the sensitive skin issues you do, and I just bought a cheap but well-reviewed epilator and it's pretty great. You have to let the hair grow out for a couple of days, not quite as long as for waxing, but once you use it they take a week or more to come back. It's a little bit painful, but not as painful as I thought it would be.
