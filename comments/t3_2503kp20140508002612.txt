This is incredibly unfair.  Both sides are allowed to have their own feelings and expectations.

No one is "entitled" to a relationship.  An event occurred, feelings differed, and decisions were made, that is all.

I would hope he would respect her decision, but that doesn't mean it can't have consequences for his feelings.
