Apparently, such things are getting to be seen as prankish (remember the story about the upskirt photos being okay?  There have been several recent cases where either legal charges were not brought or mild punishment meted out).

This is a good example of boys performing for other boys; hoping the other boys will find them daring, hilarious and bold (etc).  The amount of time these guys (like the ones on JackAss - if there are girls permanently on Jackass, please advise me) spend impressing each other is simply amazing.
