No, I meant as a salaried employee. Hourly employees are usually paid differently. Salaried employees generally don't make overtime or get paid for any extra hours.

Let me phrase it this way: If you get paid $50K a year for 40-hour work weeks, you'd effectively be paid less if you worked more than 40-hour work weeks. So, $50K for 65-hour work weeks means that you get paid less on a hour-to-salary ratio than someone who worked their 40 hours per week. 

Forgive my maths as they can be quite bad.
