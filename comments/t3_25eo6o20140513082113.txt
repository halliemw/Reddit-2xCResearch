I've never had a problem, but I also never have nitrates even when I have a UTI so I guess that's why. I also get them all the time and so basically it got to where my doctor and even my university clinic just trusted me when I came in and said I had a UTI. I mean, they'd do a culture of course, but it was always positive and always sensitive to Cipro so even without the dipstick test, they weren't hesitant to give me the antibiotics I needed. Not to mention they can still see white blood cells in the urine, which is typically how mine end up being diagnosed.
