That was great, thanks! I've heard a somewhat similar talk (live, so I don't have a link or anything) where the speaker described the current societal model of sex as a "commodity" model, where people are encouraged to get as much sex as possible, vs. a "collaborative" model where the focus should be on getting together to do something fun. Fits in well with the baseball vs. pizza metaphor.
