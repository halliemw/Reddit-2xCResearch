Practice saying no. Say no to yourself in the mirror in the morning. Be comfortable turning down friends, family and strangers. Be able to say no for important things, or even just to events you don't feel like going to. It's okay to say no.

When people ask you out or approach you like this, always have "somewhere to be." 

"Sorry, I've got class."

"I'm in a hurry, can't talk."

"No time, bye."

Don't even let the conversation start. Every response should be shutting down. Every one. No answer should give out any information, or further the conversation, or give him any in. Remember that THEY are the rude one for trying to proposition you in a very unacceptable location. You don't owe them any kindness or answers.

If you're really nervous, some schools have a program where someone will walk you to your car for added safety. Utilize that or a buddy system if you need to.
