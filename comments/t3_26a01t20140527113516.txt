Yeah.  I was really surprised that I got so many downvotes.  I spent like twenty minutes writing what I thought to be a really thoughful comment, and I thought it would be extremely helpful, practical advice to this girl and her brother.  

I never said bullying is normal.  I said it's normal for girls to break up with friends at around 12 and 13, as part of their transition from childhood to adulthood.  

Also I think acknowledging that bullying comes from jealousy helps girls to frame events in a more positive light.  When someone thinks "I have red hair and I am hideously ugly and people hate me and that's why I'm getting bullied" it's going to affect their mental outlook/self esteem more than when someone thinks "Whatever, these girls are just jealous."
