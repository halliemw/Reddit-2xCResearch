We are hopefully starting my son in summer camp 3 days a week starting in June. I'm very lucky to have supportive in laws who love incredibly close by. My mother in law tries to spend time with him whenever she can, usually 1-2 times a week for a few hours since she and her husband spend a lot of time out of town.
