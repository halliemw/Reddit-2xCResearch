You should try to not define your relationship by marital status. This will probably continue to make you feel anxious and perhaps lead you into feeling some kind of resentment towards him for not proposing fast enough. If you have a great relationship and you are communicating about your futures, you are in a better spot than some people who are already married. Googling engagement rings is OK as long as you are having fun with it.
