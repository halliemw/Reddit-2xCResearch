The vast majority of George Carlin's most famous bits are punching up.  

Again, "jokes" that are offensive are not funny.  Just because they are funny to someone else, doesn't make them funny to everyone or not offensive.  It's not an excuse that automagically makes them not offensive.  Nor does it turn it around to being the fault person/people who call it out as offensive.
