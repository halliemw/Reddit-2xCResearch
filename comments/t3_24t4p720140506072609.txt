I work in a hospital, and I'd estimate about one third of the patients at any given moment are fat. I've never noted any sort of discrimination. Not even to the morbidly obese. Not even behind their backs. 

Although, this is purely anecdotal, and, coming from Australia, not America - things may be different there.
