I recently got Implanon, which is a little plastic rod inserted into your upper arm that contains a synthetic form of progesterone. It stays effective for three years and can be removed if you and your partner decide to have kids. It's worked well for me so far (I'm forgetful so the pill wouldn't be the best idea for me).

I have found myself being more emotional recently, though I'm not sure if that's the Implanon or just stress (increased workload around the time I got the implant) or both. I can't skip periods like you might on the pill, but apparently 30% of women don't have periods on Implanon. Alas, I'm not one of those few but I've experienced significantly lighter periods than I'm used to, with minimal cramping (I normally get death cramps of doom so that's a plus). It's only been a couple of months since I got it so I can't speak to any long term effects.

But talking to your doctor is always the best way to go.
