You aren't responsible for the action of scumbags.

Deleted most of my ramble after reading through the comments.  Cities sound fucking awful.  I'd avoid any bad areas like the plague.  I'd avoid public interaction like the plague.  Interacting and being around potentially criminal strangers sounds fucking awful.

Men who catcall strangers (at least in my mind) are basically potential rapists.  The ones who then proceed to follow you down the street?  Holy shit they should fucking die.  

I'm from the suburbs.  An overly pushy taxi guy where I currently live will annoy the shit out of me, and someone walking too close behind me freaks me out.  If I were a woman getting catcalled and stalked in a city?  I'd fucking move immediately or never go back to that area if it is really isolated, that sounds terrifying and legitimately dangerous.
