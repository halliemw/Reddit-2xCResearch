I have a flat Smith and Wesson that is unfortunately not assisted opening. You know where the bony hip protrusion is on your front? Mine goes just to the inside of that. It shifts a little bit as I move about during my day, but the "I'm totally just putting my hands in my pockets" move looks normally enough to adjust it. Just be careful that there are no little knobby bits that could dig into your skin or harsh sandpaper like surfaces.
