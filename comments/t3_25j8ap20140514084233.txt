Another point:

When the driver of a car hits another person and causes them significant injury, that person is often in need of a blood transfusion. However, we do not legally mandate that people responsible for these injuries by donating blood. This would be a far safer, far less intrusive consequence to reckless behavior, and might significantly improve the safety of our roads. Drivers would need to take responsibility for the possible outcome of getting behind a wheel.

We could also mandate that people register and be prepared to donate bone marrow. This could save a whole lot of lives. This could restore the potential of a whole lot of people who would die otherwise. And it's a step up from blood donation in terms of intrusiveness and pain, but it's still way less intrusive than being forced to carry a baby to term. And yet, we don't mandate this, either.

Why should abortion be a special case?
