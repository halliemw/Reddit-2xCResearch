I would posit that the difference is that feminists are responding to a positivist statement (this is how the world is) with a normative reflection (but that's not how the world should be) emphasising the difference between how the world is and what the world should be like; whereas, the "not all men" response is responding to a positivist statement (this is how the world is) with another positivist statement (not 100% of the world is like that) whilst implying that because there are some exceptions, the entire premise is false.  The "not all men" response does not move the conversation forward.

I agree with you that we do have to be cautious about avoiding generalizations, but that has to be balanced with acknowledging that we live in a world which does treat genders differently.  Ideally, feminist expression should be communicated in ways that make it clear that there is never an intention to insist that all men are a particular way.
