I don't have a daughter, but I wish my mom had told me some more things when I got my period. I was in grade six and it was horrible. My mother was open, but fairly hands off as well. This was hard for me because my period was heavy, and the products available weren't good enough. My mother never told me what else I could buy or use and so I spent years struggling with my period. It wasn't until this past year when I found out about Diva Cups did I finally get some peace. So when the time comes, I hope you help your daughter be well prepared. :)
