The Dalkon Shield, a model no longer in use, was the cause for why so many north american women hear horror stories about IUDs. It was never approved in Europe, but the Dalkon Shield both was a bad shape which had an increased risk of perforation, and the string was porous which allowed infections to crawl into the uterus causing all kinds of problems w infected uteruses and fallopian tubes. 

Fortunately, all the models since then don't make the same mistakes the Dalkon did, and they're significantly safer.
