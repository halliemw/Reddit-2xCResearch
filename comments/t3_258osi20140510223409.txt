There are many different kinds of hurt; it does not need to be a matter of one being worse than another.  About a year after her death, I read a book called "Motherless Daughters", that was about daughters whose mothers had either passed away or abandoned them.  Reading that book was the first time it occurred to me that a mother could choose to be without her children, and I felt lucky that at least my mom had wanted me.  So my heart goes out to you, and do not say my loss is more severe, for to me, your loss must be just as hard, if not worse.

Before I had a mother-in-law and stepmother, I used mother's day to celebrate family, and those who supported me.  I hope you have someone like that you can celebrate tomorrow, mother or no.
