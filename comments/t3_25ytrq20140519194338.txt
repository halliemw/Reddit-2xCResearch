Why do you subscribe to pro-feminist subreddits if you hate feminism so much? Honestly, you don't seem altogether fond of women in general, so why the hell are you here? Go over to /r/mensrights; they'll be happy to accomodate you as long as you talk a lot about how much you hate us and make it clear that you "aren't like those *other* women."

Edit: Made a typo that I can't even explain.
