My two days using it I was a little nervous, they're quite awkward to fold and insert. After those two days I got used to it, and it ended up fitting fine, the spills quickly stopped. I did feel a little more "achy" than unusual, but whether that's just usual cramping or from the diva cup I'm not sure. The aches went away in 3 days. All in all, 10/10 worth it.
