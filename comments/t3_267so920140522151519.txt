BREAD! And, for me, Dairy! Both cause me to bloat up like crazy. The Dairy causes painful bloating, but I am somewhat lactose intolerant (though I wasn't when I was younger, this happened around age 20). 

Carb blockers can work in the short term, for some people. I used to routinely use Natrol Carb Intercept before I just cut out most breads and pasta. Carb Blockers can cause side effects in some people like gas or upset stomach. I personally never had that problem.  But it was better in the long run for me to just change my diet and cut out the breads because I was on the heavier side of my acceptable weight and now I am just right.

And I drink a ton of water now and almost no soda, and that does wonders for your waistline when you are retaining water!
