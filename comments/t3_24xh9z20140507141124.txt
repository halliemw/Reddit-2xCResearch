No, it's just a jab at the typical summertime nonsense.  

I like having a healthy body because it feels good, not so I can look good in a bikini next month.  The seasonal articles that assume women are only motivated towards fitness to look good in that new dress/swimsuit/whatever have always struck me as vapid pieces that underestimate us.  Glad to see someone skewer it.
