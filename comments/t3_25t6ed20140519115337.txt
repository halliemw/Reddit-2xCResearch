If you want to go on the trip for your little sisters sake, do that but then spend ALL of your time with her.  Your cheating dad will be relieved that he can spend more time with OTGA, and you can spend some real quality time with your sister.

Don't announce it, when you get there, get up early the next morning and just go somewhere that you know she will like.  Basically abandon your dad.  AND he if says anything basically confront him and let him know that if has a shred of decency he won't want little sis finding out.
