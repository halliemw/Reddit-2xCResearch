Just so you know, this isn't the case everywhere. I work at a Walgreens at the register, where the Plan-B is kept. I don't give a shit if you buy it, just like I don't care if you buy the biggest box of condoms. It has zero impact on my life. Chances are I don't know you and may never see you again in my life.
