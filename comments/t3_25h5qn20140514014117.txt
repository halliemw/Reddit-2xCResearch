It really pisses me off when medical professional's blow you off. It took me a long time to realize that there was no reason for me to put up with a doctor who was an asshole or didn't take me seriously. You have every right to go doctor shopping and find someone who is right for you. I need someone who is willing to spend time talking/explaining things to me rather than getting annoyed at having to spend more then 5 minutes with me. Finding a good doc/NP is a huge pain in the ass, but when you find someone you trust it makes it all worth it.
