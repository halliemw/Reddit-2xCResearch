Yep I get this, usually lasts for 24 hours after we have sex. I always thought it was just the fluids mixing. I just clean out my labia really well in the shower, but I do not douche (oh god, why would you?!), and it usually lasts after I shower, it just goes away the next day unless we have sex again.
