I'm 33, have had double depression my entire life (was diagnoses as a toddler), and I still fight every day to find something that works. I'm on a waiting list for DBS and will most likely be starting rounds of ECT this summer. It's one thing to be treatment resistant, but it's a whole other to just quit trying and saying attempting to get better is not worth your time. We can't help the cards we are dealt, but what matters is how we play them. Many people have to work their asses off for years to have a decent quality of life- whether it's health, income, trauma, education, and endless other obstacles. We don't all get free passes to happiness. But it's your own choice, I guess, if you want to remain the way you are - you just can't blame others or call it stigma, then, if they don't have sympathy for your situation.
