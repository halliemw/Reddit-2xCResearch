I've worked in IT for going on 17 years now and I've never had an issue. I've never been made to feel uncomfortable. I've had ONE douche boss. He was a douche to pretty much everyone, so it wasn't really about sexism so much as asshole-ry. 

I don't doubt these things happen, but I personally have never seen anything at any of the places I've worked.
