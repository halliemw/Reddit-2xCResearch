I think they equate "willing to cook and clean because raised in a traditional way" to submissive and quiet. The guy in the documentary said that he was looking for just that, he even used the word 'slave' I think. I think that's also why men look for a wife here in Eastern Europe, because from my experience most women do everything, cook, clean, take care of children and husband + work. But they do argue and stand up for themselves and take no bullshit from anyone.
