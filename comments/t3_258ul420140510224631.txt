I was crazy lucky in high school. I went to an all-girl's Catholic high school and our "Christian Living" teacher went all out with the truth. All forms of birth control. Rolled a condom on a banana. Images of STDs. Emphasis on protection, respect, and making a choice. Covered signs of abuse in relationships and how to seek out help. She always began or ended with the appropriate disclaimer about the Catholic church's position, but I swear I'm a feminist because of the teacher's and nuns in that school. So bad ass. Only problem was, it was taught senior year... little late for some. Freshman year would have been more effective.
