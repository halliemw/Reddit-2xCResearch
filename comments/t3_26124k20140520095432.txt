Same for me! Thinking it through and trying to figure it out isn't going to make it go away if it's there and if it's not, you spend a month terribly upset for nothing. You'll know eventually, and you WILL be able to deal with it. 

Also the whole "Thank God I'm not a teenager" always helps me feel better.
