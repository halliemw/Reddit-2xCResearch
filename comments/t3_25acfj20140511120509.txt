I'm with you too. Just because someone gives birth to you doesn't automatically make them a wonderful mother deserving of praise. 

I wish I had a mother who loved me. She's abusive and an addict. The last thing she told me us that she wishes she had aborted me, but people still look at me like I'm the monster when I'm asked what I got her for Mother's Day and I say "nothing." 

FWIW, it does make me appreciate my MIL and step-MIL more.
