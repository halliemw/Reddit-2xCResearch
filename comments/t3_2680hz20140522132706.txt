I read the content, I tried to feel empathic but I wasn't very successful, maybe because I don't really experience what you do, and what I could take from the post was that you don't like people asking you out without knowing you first.

I found it to be a little confusing because asking someone out should, in my mind, lead to knowing the person better.

You also mentioned that one costumer you thought to be a cool guy was sexting you after you messaged him. Yeah, there are people like that, mostly guys.

I know women who get asked out frequently but I never met one that complained about it, even when asked if she didn't get tired of the attention, none of them said it bothered them, some even said that they liked(not all of them, for the others it was just something normal that they do not care about), so it really is a different perspective from what I'm used to.
