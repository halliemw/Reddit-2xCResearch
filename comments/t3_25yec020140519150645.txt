>Anecdotal evidence only deserves to be responded to with anecdotal evidence

Uh..what? That just flat-out isn't true. If somebody comes at me telling me evolution didn't happen, I don't say "nyu-uh, it totally did." I instead try to walk them through some of the science. Or take them through some socratic method questioning and get them to think through some of this stuff themselves. 

If you've studied feminism, you don't counter sexist attitudes with "Actually I'm not friends with boys anymore because all men I know are dramatic." That just comes off as misandrist and doesn't address all of the systemic societal problems OP has probably actually studied.

Just my $.02. I don't think OP is a terrible person or anything, I just see it as a missed opportunity.
