He's been to the doctor, and he's an adult who can decide whether or not he wants to undergo further treatment. If it was me, I wouldn't even do the nasal spray & mist, as those can cause lifelong problems (although they are fairly necessary for some people). You don't get to make those choices for him. He is an adult, and I think it's pretty cruddy to basically threaten him (by leaving) and emotionally punish him to try to get him to do what you want.

He is an adult. He went to the doctor. If you can't handle the way his body responds to the allergens in your home, then you can find a close friend or family member to take the cat in.
