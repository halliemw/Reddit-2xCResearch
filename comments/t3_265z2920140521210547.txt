I know that you would never do them because they are illegal, but here's a reminder that most party drugs amplify nervousness. That's the internal caution. External caution is that inebriation around untrustworthy people is a **horrible** idea.

If you're going together, stay together. Don't leave one another alone because that doesn't sound safe. Certainly is will increase risk of attack/assault.
