Im not super hairy but i just let what happens, happen. I shave my armpits as an antismell thing but other than that only shave my legs when theyll be on display. Ive been with my SO for five years but i made it pretty clear that ill shave what he'll shave when we first got together. I used to be bald as a baby in my early 20s but then i decided that was creepy so have sported full bush for 7ish years. Why the fuck do i want to reverse puberty!?! Also i live in a cold climate so they leg shaving thing only happens in high summer lol. Fuck it, lifes too short. Although apparently im the only person my guy has ever dated who takes this stance on hair but five years so meh
