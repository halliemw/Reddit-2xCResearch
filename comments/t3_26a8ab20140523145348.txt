> Maybe a better idea would be campaigns suggesting we not have sex with people who have been heavily drinking?

They can say that all they want, but then when it happens anyway, what then?  Especially when two people are drinking and have sex...people usually say "oh then the person who initiated is at fault," but I think that's problematic for a number of reasons.

>  I find rhetoric like "just because you regret it doesn't make it rape" really furthers the idea that most rape victims are lying. 

The person said:

> I've had girl friends get drunk at a party and hookup, the next day they would ask if they were raped because they regretted it.

I mean, if people are doing this, I find it hard to say they shouldn't be told they weren't raped because of the ideas it furthers.  It would be wrong if someone innocent was branded a rapist, even if they weren't found guilty or whatever, because to set the accuser right would lend support to something bad other people said.

It's possible the person you responded to is overstating things, but going off of what she said...
