Oh man, this is so true for me. I started as a temp at my organization (I was 26), and was waiting to be hired full time (and waiting...and waiting...). My boss quit and one of the senior managers told me I should apply for her job. It was a solid 2 steps up, but I went for it and got it. At 27 I was the youngest director in the organization. The first year I was sure I just dumb lucked into it- totally felt like an imposter. Now 2 years later, I'm waiting for my boss to retire so I can move up again. Because I deserve it :)
