Yea ok I feel you. I actually come here because I'm exhausted by the MRM circlejerks... There's not a very viable middle ground of reasonable people to discuss these issues with and this sub actually has a good number of them. Plus reading perspective of women I think makes me a better man and a better advocate for equal rights. It increases my understanding and empathy with women. MRM only discuss the worst case scenario women, where you're forced to assume every chick is Jodi Arias. It's no better than the radfems... This sub is filled with so many intelligent women (and some men)... It's become a safe space of reasoning.

Sorry if that's not your goal here, but just thought I'd explain why...
