Also as another user mentioned, and I touched on, this was a *niche* subreddit - it was a sort of soft and cuddly place most of the time. 

TwoX wasn't ever meant to represent ALL women, and now it seems to be intended to do so... if that's set up as a binary - most of the site is "dude oriented" but TwoX is here for the laydeez... how can one subreddit hope to capture the same level of nuance for women as the whole rest of reddit is expected to for men?
