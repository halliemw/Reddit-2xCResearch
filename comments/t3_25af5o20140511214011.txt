My mom died 13 years ago, she was 42- Mother's Day is one of the WORST days of the year for me. I didn't have a real wedding, I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it without her. It was just me and my husband, 2 friends and a justice of the peace. 

I remember we had a family friend who had recently lost his son tell me at the funeral- "the pain never goes away, you just get used to it."  

I try to turn Mother's day into a celebration of her, instead of just spending the day being sad. Some years I succeed, and some I don't. This year was not a good one.
