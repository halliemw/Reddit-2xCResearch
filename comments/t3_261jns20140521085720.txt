I'm not saying push herself on the kid, I'm saying if the kid is being a jerk to her, just be nice in return.  Don't lash out or be mean to the kid in reaction.  Remain calm and polite.  

I've never, ever said she should be fake (that's awful!  no!!) or try to be her friend.  I'm saying she should remain nice when the kid acts up, because that's what kids DO.  

I would absolutely **never** tell somebody they should push themselves into someone else's life if they don't want it.  There is a HUGE difference between staying nice and being nice to someone, no matter how cruel they are to you, and pushing yourself or faking something you don't feel.  =/
