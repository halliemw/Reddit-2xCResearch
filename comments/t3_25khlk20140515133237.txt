People almost never ignore me, outright.  Like Professor Owl (whom I am assuming might be a professor), I'm a professor too.  And I'm old enough now that people listen (yep, ageism at work).  Younger women, though, sometimes get talked over (but not when I'm presiding over something). 

What happens instead is that people simply ignore feminine voices.  At most meetings, women say a few more things (yes, I keep track).  And some women ignore other women, too (there are some egregious examples where I work).  A younger woman can say something and two minutes later, several people will ask a question that shows they didn't listen.  If an older woman or any man repeats it, they suddenly hear it.

Oh, and in years of observing television-watching behavior at work, among students, in bars, in homes, I've noticed that men will frequently turn the channel when the dialogue is between two women.  They'll watch if it's man-to-man or woman-to-man (man-to-man is what men prefer, though - and I actually got to do some rather extensive research on that at one point; no way to randomly choose homes for observation, but I did get inside a wide variety of households for observation).
