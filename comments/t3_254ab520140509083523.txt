NFP is a very safe method when done properly. Does your SO understand the method? I know some men feel more comfortable when they are able to participate and actually see that there are steady, clear symptoms you can rely on.

I can absolutely understand your hesitation to take hormones. It might be a small risk, but it can kill your libido permanently, plus a lot of the side effects come slowly and many women only ever realize them once they get off the hormones.

But I also understand your SO's wish for safety. Sex is a thing between two (or more...) people and in a relationship it does affect both of you. So when he really doesn't feel safe with NFP (I think he should give it an honest try at least!) and you don't feel good about taking hormones, you could look into other non-hormonal bc *together* (no reason for you to do all the work).

What I can think of:

Diaphragm - can be combined with condoms. Condoms + diaphragm can be combined with CI. Beat that, you little swimmers.

Non-hormonal IUD, copper or copper-gold. Long-term, tried and tested for centuries, can be combined with NFP and any barrier method(s). 

Please don't let him pressure you into taking the pill. When you had a real discussion about the alternatives and ruled every single one of them out *together*, and when you then decide you want to try the pill - good. But not with a gun to your head, that's just awful.

Edit: does your SO know about different bc methods or does he just wants you to take the pill because it's the most reknown? Read about the PI of different methods together, he will see that other methods are even safer (the IUD for example) and hormones really aren't the only option.
