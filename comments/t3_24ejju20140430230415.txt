Oh, I read the article. I've just also read plenty of other actually unbiased articles and studies on the gender gap. Saying "Well, sure it's real if you *don't* adjust for all these factors, and discrimination must be in play somewhere" doesn't make it honest.

I mean, even the sleazy way they try to address the discrimination factor--20% of 23% is 4.6%, and even 41% of 23% is only 9.4%. But it's a lot less impressive to say that the gender pay gap is *actually* only five to ten cents. "Women make 95 cents for every man's dollar!" doesn't sound as calamitous, though, so it's "20% of the wage gap is explained by discrimination", while makes it sound like it's a 20% gap rather than 20% of 23%.

The funny thing is, I support everything they support. More flexible hours, better parental leave, all of that. I'm behind it 100%. But you shouldn't have to mislead people with inaccurate numbers to get them to agree with you, you should just believe enough in your cause being the right thing to do on its own, without the scare tactics.
