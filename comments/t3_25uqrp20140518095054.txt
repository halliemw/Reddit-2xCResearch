That's the worst melodrama I've read in a while. 

So many people acting in immature fashions ... It'd take a psychology teams years to work through everyones issues. 

Seriously. Seek out professional counseling. Do it now ... don't talk to him anymore, don't call his wife/girlfriend anymore ... don't scream recriminations at everyone .... It's fucked up on so man different levels you really need professional help.
