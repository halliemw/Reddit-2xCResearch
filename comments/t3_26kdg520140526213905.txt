Fittings can be done with a shirt on. They ask you to put your hands on your hips and they first wrap a measuring tape under your breasts to get your band size, then around the fullest part of your breast to get the cup size. A bra that fits should not push the girls together and should lie flat against the skin around the back, up from the cups and in the center between cups with no gapping. It's all done very professionally. They will bring you some bras that should fit and ask about what kinds you like or what issues you have had (straps falling, bulging, etc.) If you are comfortable with it, once you have the bra on they can take a look and tell you if its a good fit, help with strap adjustment. Its a really good idea. If you can talk to your dad about the issue I'm sure he would be thrilled to just give you the money to get a few decently fitting bras, rather than go shopping for them. Just maybe be nice and get some that are supportive and cute but not pushing sexy. while its great to have, at your age it might give dad a small aneurism.
