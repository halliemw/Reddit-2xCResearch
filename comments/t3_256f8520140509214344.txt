It's always hard to tell why exactly someone likes a book like Hunger Games, because books that become really popular like that always have a lot of different angles of appeal. But the books that come to mind for me are:

* Robin McKinley books, like Beauty, Spindle's End, etc
* Dianna Wynne Jones books, especially Howl's Moving Castle, Dark Lord of Derkholm. Actually, scratch that, especially all of them
* Princess Bride, though it can be overwhelmingly silly
* Abhorsen series, as was mentioned elsewhere
* Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass
* The Wizard of Oz, maybe?
* Jane Austen books, maybe?
* Daphne du Maurier books, maybe?
