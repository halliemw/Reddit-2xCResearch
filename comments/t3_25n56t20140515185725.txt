Young men are often full of piss and vinegar, and generally speaking aren't really enlightened of how to treat others(or themselves for that matter). It could very well be that they wanted to show off to their friends, but based on what I've seen first hand It wouldn't be my first conclusion. (I say this as a young man, socially surrounded by young men, and as someone whose also been yelled at plenty of times by strangers.[Usually, you guessed it, by other young men.]) Side note: I'm never aggressive towards anyone, but I've still got some piss and vinegar. :P
