I will tolerate my husband calling me baby. He does it very rarely. Only other person who calls me baby is my mother. He usually uses 'baby' when he is trying to soothe me because I am upset or sick.

We usually call each other "love" or "lovey". When we are interacting with each other and the kids at the same time, I often call him, "Daddy" but because our son used to call him Wayne instead of Daddy.

There are a few friends that I allow to call me other pet names, but (1) they asked first and (2) told me why they want to use that pet name with me.

Strangers or people I really don't like using a pet name? Insta Rage.
