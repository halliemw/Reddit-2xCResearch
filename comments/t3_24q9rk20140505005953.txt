>And we, as women, need to stop shaming each other for how we react to abusers and harassers.

This, this, 1000 times, this.

Using your gut to keep yourself safe IS a feminist action.  Sometimes, we must shoot from the hip.  I envision a reality in which we may all have a productive conversation about agency, but sometimes we have to make it up as we go based on what our instincts tell us.  I freeze up at least half the time I am harrassed--this does not make me weak or anit-feminist.  I am re-learning to trust my gut to help me take the appropriate actions to keep me safe.
