OMG ME TOO! I thought I was the only one. I would purposefully seek out fights with my parents or my friends or anyone really that I actually like but couldn't stand while I was on my period. Every little thing would set me off. Eventually I learned to actually tell people when I was on my period so that they could give me some space to fume in isolation.
