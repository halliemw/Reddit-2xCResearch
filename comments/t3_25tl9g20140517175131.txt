I totally feel you, and that's great to hear you and your SO are on the same page as far as the mom and baby go for the future. 

My SO's father abused him and his mother for a long time and my heart aches for them; I want to stand up to him for my SO so badly but it's just not my fight. My boyfriend quite literally acts like it never happened. I can't imagine what goes on in his head to be able to detach what horrible things he went through. He tries to act like he has "put it behind him" (his words) but some things in the way he acts and such and he has told me a little bit about it, he breaks down crying and you just know there is no way in hell it's ever left his mind.

Sorry to sort of derail you, I just wanted to let you know that you're not the only one who is in that position. =/ All I know is that if he ever takes a toe out of line towards anyone (not just me) in my presence, there's going to be another fire in san diego because the ground will be on fire for how fast I've left their house. And I'll never ever go back. Violence is never okay.
