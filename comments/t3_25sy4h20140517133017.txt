I really don't think that need a citation. How many armed conflicts are there in theworld? How many violent crimes per day go on? How about in just one city? I'd consider just one genocide in the course of history enough to say that humans are violent creatures. We've has many.


Would you say that humans are peaceful creatures instead? Or moderately violent?
