I cook everything for my boyfriend, dress in a way that I know that he likes, and am super submissive in bed.  On the flipside, I keep my hair very short (like 3/4") because I know he likes it, too :)

However, he has never ever pressured me for any of these things, and I happen to love doing them all.  It's really nice to have found someone I'm so compatible with in these aspects.  For a long time I avoided embracing these inclinations of mine because I felt obligated to.  I'm so glad I got over that and just do what feels right for me/us now!
