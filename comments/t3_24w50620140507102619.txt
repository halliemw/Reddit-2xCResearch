That's why I opted for the pills instead of an illegal surgical, which was really expensive and I could have a LOT more complications. Even though it was risky, I probably wouldn't have any complications, and of course a lot fewer than if I went through with the pregnancy (which would be risky for both baby and me due to the amount of meds I took).

In the end the pills didn't work, though, and now I have a daughter.
