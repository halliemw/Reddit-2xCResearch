I was at wondercon all three days and despite being a really female-dominated event there was a lot of male elitism. As just one of many teenage girls attending I had an excellent time and met some very nice people but there was certainly an air of hostility, and it didn't help that I had a "sexy" cosplay. Adult men constantly solicited me for photos--which is fine, like, it's a convention--while making creepy comments or trying to get me to understand some obscure reference to a fantasy novel and then getting upset when I had no clue what they were talking about.

Even as I walked around the exhibit hall I could sense when (male) vendors were annoyed by my presence looking at collectibles or anime figurines or anything not Explicitly Female, like I was invading their space. Because obviously I should stick to my romance novels and stop pretending to know anything about retro shounen anime.
