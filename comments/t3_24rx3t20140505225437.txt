I owe my freedom to vote, attend higher education, use contraception, choose what I can and can't do with my body, own property, sue, divorce, receive equal pay, protect myself against discrimination, and choose whether or not to marry to feminism. 

Without feminism, women wouldn't be able to practice medicine, law, public office, or hold patents.   And because you deliberately only decided to quote the most radical feminists you could possibly find, feminism isn't good enough? 

Feminism focuses on women's rights. Just like the LGBT movement focuses on gay rights, but I don't see you complaining about them only focusing on LGBT  instead of straight people. I don't see you complaining that the NAACP doesn't focus on other minorities. Men have a pretty long history of denying women basic human rights, but we're the jerks for focusing on improving women's lives instead of men's?

Women have been denied basic human rights again and again and again throughout history, I think we have the right to focus on our own problems for awhile in the name of equality without being considered man haters. 

" I see. So, because a dictionary defines a word, it defines the essence of a political ideology? "

So because you cherry pick the most radical feminists you could possibly find, that means feminism isn't about equality? You google radicalism, you get radicalism, plain and simple. You want to demonize a movement that's done a world of good because of a few bad apples, then fine. But don't pretend you actually care about the issues if you're willing to discredit a movement that has done more for the advancements of human rights that you ever will.
