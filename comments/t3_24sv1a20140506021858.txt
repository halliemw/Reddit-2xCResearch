I suspect you may have more success with normal conversation when they aren't in a group, they feed off each other. Try inviting just one of your friends to lunch and see how that goes. If the conversation steers in a direction you don't like, you will find it easier to steer it away if it's just one person you're competing with. If they persist, then actually mention that you're bored of it because that's what everyone talks about. Again individually they are more inclined to notice what they are doing and adapt.
