My point is that people do listen to celebrities, and sometimes stupidly so.  Jenny McCarthy might not have said anything new but there's a lot of people who didn't hear about the original paper until she told them about it.  There's bound to be tons of people who haven't heard of the breast cancer genes until now.  I'm not sure if the article is calling women stupid so much as people in general stupid, and the type of people who listen to celebrities probably fall under both sexes.
