As I type this, I really wish that it were not true. I teach at a school in inner-city Los Angeles. It is a charter school, meaning that while we don't require students pay, we can still be a little more selective than private schools in who applies. It is a school runned and founded by an older African American woman who, quite frankly, is psychotic. She is horrible to both students and her teachers as evidenced by the  following story.

Last week, she calls all the female students to the auditorium. While we have uniforms (white top, black bottoms) many of the students blatantly disregard with no consequences. With the rising heat, our female students had begun to dress in way that was a bit too revealing for an educational institution. So she call girls together to tell them that their clothing is too inappropriate. **But rather than a professional and reasonable explanation, she tells these young women that they should not be wearing these clothes because most are overweight and have no business showing off their bodies.** She called a room full of young women *fat*.
 
Then she continues on to 
*name which students are not "fat" (stand up so we can see you!)
*name which students who ARE "fat" (stand up so we can see you!)
*compare her shopping habits (Nordstroms) to theirs ("swap meet")
*explain that 100+ lbs is fat
*say their male teachers stare

My students were hopping mad (as they had every right to be). She made the discussion not about appropriate clothing for school attendance, but rather an issue of their self worth and self image. The woman is not only disrespectful, unprofessional, and unrealistic, she's downright abusive to all who work for her or attend her school. I have many, many more stories sadly.

TL;DR: My administrator tells our young, black high school girls they cannot wear revealing clothing because they are too fat.
