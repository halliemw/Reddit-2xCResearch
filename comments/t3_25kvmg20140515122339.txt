I don't think I've ever reported a crime to the police. When I had a credit card go missing, and I suspected that it had been intentionally taken (I was with a study abroad group and another girl in my group also had a credit card disappear and charges show up a week later) I reported it to my bank and credit card company and let them deal with it. Car accidents, no matter who was at fault, get reported directly to insurance unless someone is injured. Of course, I've never been involved in a major crime, but I think a lot of people tend to seek alternative methods of dealing with things if possible, especially when their primarily goal is to protect themselves.
