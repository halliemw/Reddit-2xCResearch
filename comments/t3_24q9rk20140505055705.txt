So the implication is that, if you didn't have a boyfriend, he would have some chance. I agree with the author on her second point most of all: shutting aggressive guys down by saying you have a boyfriend implies that it isn't their pushiness (or whatever) that is at issue, it is the fact that you aren't available to them. If you can honestly say, "I have a boyfriend but if I didn't I would so bang you tonight." then it makes sense. Otherwise it seems like a cop out.
