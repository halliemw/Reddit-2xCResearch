I'm just as frustrated r/twox will never be the same, but I've come around to hoping this will impact reddit.  I think we can help shift the default perspective to less misogyny. There are other safe space communities opening up that wouldn't have.  It's selfish to want the girls only tree house back.  The hejira is necessary but painful. The cause is noble or something. This sub became a default and default is generally a male perspective and I come and go to not burn out on pushing back and trying to patiently educate.  Thank you for trying.  

See you on /r/SRSwormen
