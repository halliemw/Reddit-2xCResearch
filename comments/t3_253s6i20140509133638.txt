My ex's mother had him because she felt like she was expected to have babies. She then had another. She's been a terrible parent and her kids have suffered for it. Parenting is harder than I ever imagined. It has some awesome rewards, but I always wanted children and some days I would cheerfully just walk out the door and keep going. I can't imagine how hard it would be if I hadn't been committed to the idea from the start.
