I found this [game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) ridiculously addictive. Took me a little while to get, but now I can't stop.

One of my favourite shows is Treme, which I find really compelling (so many different characters, and set in New Orleans!). 

Boingboing.net is pretty interesting, as well...

Good luck!
