I don't think he was being racist or trying to make a joke about it. I think he was trying to say that black men are immediately put into a "scary black man" category no matter who that person really is. He is pointing out the racism and why he may be treated differently. Just like if I was a small, shy, white girl I would be assumed most likely that I do nothing wrong. I don't really think it was a joke OR a racist comment. Just a sad fact. He was trying to make it sound sarcastic so the OP knew he didn't believe that. It's just a touchy subject so people get knee-jerk reactions to it and it's hard to read actual intentions and sarcasm unless you put a lot of disclaimers or "lols". I could be totally wrong, but it is very likely that as a black man he would be threatening to a lot of ignorant people for just being a different color. madness.
