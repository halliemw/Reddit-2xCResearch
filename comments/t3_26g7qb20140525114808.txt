Goodness, every month I go through the same cycle of thoughts: 

"Am I gaining weight? I think I am. Oh no, I'm so chubbs now! No one will love me! Sorry for complaining so much. Sorry for being so annoying and emotional. Am I annoying you? Are you mad at me? Do you want to break up with me? I'm being silly, of course I know you don't this happens every month. You dont want to break up, though, right? Right? I'm pretty sure you think I'm really annoying. This is so silly, I'm being silly. Sorry for being silly and annoying you. I'm not actually chubby, and I know I'm not annoying you as much as I thought I was." And the rest of the month I'm fine.
