You should check out [Craftsy](http://www.craftsy.com/?_ct=wberqbdql-bewe)! They have video courses that cover nearly every sewing technique you'd want to learn, including a class that specifically goes over how to alter [ready-to-wear clothes](http://www.craftsy.com/class/tailoring-ready-to-wear/170?_ct=sbqii-jxucu-huse-ycw&_ctp=2&_egg=sekhiu_wqbbuho_20131031&_ege=170). The classes can be pretty expensive, but they usually have pretty good sales regularly. Annnnd I think, which I could be wrong about this, but I think if you sign up, your first class is free. I've taken one class, [Sew & Design an A-Line Skirt](http://www.craftsy.com/class/design-and-sew-an-a-line-skirt/136?_ct=sbqii-jxucu-byij-ycw&_ctp=16&_egg=sekhiu_wqbbuho_20131031&_ege=136), and it was pretty awesome- easy to follow and now I have a pattern for a skirt that is completely tailored to my shape that I can make over and over.  I'm taking another for making the perfect t-shirt, and that one came with a pattern that they teach you how to alter everything on so it fits and looks exactly how you want.    
As for sewing machines, I personally love my [Brother CS6000i](http://www.amazon.com/Brother-Feature-Rich-Built-In-Auto-Size-Buttonholes/dp/B000JQM1DE) as it has a ton of differnt stitch styles, and has a speed slider thing on it so that you can control how fast the machine stitches instead of doing it on the foot pedal, which is great for me as I tend to have a lead foot lol!!! /r/sewing probably has a lot more (and better informed) suggestions than I do, but my mom has the same one and she can't cut a straight line, so it has to be a pretty awesome machine if it can help her look like a half decent seamstress!
