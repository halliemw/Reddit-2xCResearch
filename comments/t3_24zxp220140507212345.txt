I think we just need to see how this plays out - a lot of this depends on the vigilance of the mod team. As they said: help them out by reporting trolls and not engaging with them. And mods: if you can't keep up, don't be heroes. Recruit more mods. 

Personally: if the mod team and the community work together it could be a *good* thing. New female Redditors will find this community, and older Redditors will find us after all the drama in the Reddit metasphere.
