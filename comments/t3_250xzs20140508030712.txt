I don't know how old you are, but I'm going to assume you're in high school. With that being said, it's probably safe to say you will not marry this guy. I would highly suggest not getting back with him because he got physical with you. It may be because he was drunk, but still, that is not a situation you would like to be in. It may not have been that bad this time, but next time it could be a lot worse. I hope this helps, stay safe.
