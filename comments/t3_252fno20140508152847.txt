>Women are not a monolithic block. We hold various opinions of issues which would get us booed on this subreddit because we do not conform to this subreddit's definition of what a woman is

I think that a gender flair will help demonstrate that women have varied opinions.  Before it became a default sub, I assumed that most 2XC commenters were women (unless they stated otherwise).  If I read an opinion that differed from most other posters, I would get a more well-rounded representation of the opinions held by women in this subreddit.  Now that it is a default sub (with a significantly larger male audience), a lot of women in this sub may dismiss dissenting opinions from women and erroneously believe they come from men.
