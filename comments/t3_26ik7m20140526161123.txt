Tights are not pants. I guess to me its a matter of interpretation "tights" are thin have feet or convertible toes,  and are what my daughter wears under her leotard for Dance. Tights are usually pretty transparent and not always worn with underwear but worn under shorts, dresses, and so on.   I think what is shown in the picture are leggings, and are often fine as pants IMO.
