I had two Mirenas.  The first caused me to spot for about 3 months and the insertion was awful.  None the less, I thought it was great.
The second, I only spotted a couple days but I was breastfeeding. (Pregnancy intended, first Mirena was removed/did not fail.)

It's the only birth control that didn't turn me into a weird hormonal mess.
