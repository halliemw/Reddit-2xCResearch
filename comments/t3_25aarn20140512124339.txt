Agreed. I think it was good for me to get it down in writing while I was emotional so I could look back at it now that I've calmed down, but its not something I should ever send. 

I've tried sitting down and asking her about why its important to her that I shave - I wanted to understand better, you know, learn something from my mom because she usually knows what she's talking about - but all she could offer me was a 'because thats what you're supposed to do' response. I'm 22 years old. While thats never been a good reason to do anything, I stopped accepting it years ago.
