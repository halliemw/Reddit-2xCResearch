Great answer. I'm in my 30s and I still call my dad when I need advice. He's infinitely patient and gives me calm, rational input (my mom is very flighty and emotional). I've always felt so supported by him - he will tell me if he thinks something is a bad idea, but he also respects my independence and doesn't judge or told-you-so me if I choose differently. 


I remember having a lot of fun with my dad when I was a kid - I loved playing catch and playing with hot wheels (also a huge barbie enthusiast), we'd have tickle battles, I'd help him memorize lines for a community theater play, we'd go up to his office and he'd test my hearing for fun (he's an audiologist). One of our favorite things was going to the hardware store - he'd get a big lumber cart no matter what we were buying and I would pretend it was a boat or a racecar and we'd wheel around the store. He'd talk to me about anything I thought was interesting. He will carry a stupid joke on indefinitely - he is still making the same dad jokes he made when I was 7, and I love them. 


When I got older, I went through a phase where I was a total turd and treated my parents like crap. I grew out of it and feel bad about it to this day. 


My point is... What you said is totally true. If OP has her back and treats her like a person with interests (rather than a Girl who likes Girl Things) she will probably adore him. I love science and working with people because of my dad's influence. I went to grad school (twice) because he told me I could do anything I wanted. If he called me in ten minutes and said he needed me to come home, I'd get on a plane.
