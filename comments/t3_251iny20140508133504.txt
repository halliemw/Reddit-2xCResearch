Yep. I always agonize over how much to explain vs. how short to keep the comment.

I have no idea what I would responded with if you'd said, "yes, I was going to hire an escort." I don't actually know anything about escorts so who am I to judge? 

I've been in a similar position as OP before. In my case, I kept the relationship going after my trust was broken and it was never the same. The relationship eventually failed to the betterment of both of us. I don't believe that just because it was never the same in my relationship doesn't mean that OP can't work things out. There were a lot of factors that caused my relationship to fail. It's impossible to say this one breach of trust doomed it.
