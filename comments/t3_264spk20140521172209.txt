I understand that. I brought it up because I went to my mom sobbing several times when I was in high school over "not feeling right" and being very depressed in general and she never tried to help me in any other way than being there for me to cry on. Which is better than nothing, but I had serious problems that needed professional attention, and looking back now as an adult on how I carried myself back then and all the warning signs I displayed, it was obvious.


I have spent thousands on therapy in my adult life and can genuinely say that it has saved my life. It would have benefited me greatly to have exposure to certain coping skills, etc. at a younger age and may have prevented my dropping out of high school, doing a ton of drugs and/or generally treating myself like shit. I don't think it would have hurt, at least.
