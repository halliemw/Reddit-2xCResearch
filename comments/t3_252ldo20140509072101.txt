I'll have to check that out! Once I realized it wasn't some cancerous tumor killing me starting at my vagina I have definitely found humor in the situation.  My best friends even named it lady lump.  Maybe TMI but I can tell you having breast tissue in your vagina makes for some crazy amazing orgasms.  If it wasn't so unsightly and uncomfortable (it would get really big during my period) mighta thought about keeping it... maybe...
