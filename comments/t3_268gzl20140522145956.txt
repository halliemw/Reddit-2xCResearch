I'm trying to make this decision as well. I'm leaning towards copper, mostly because it's non-hormonal, but I usually have one really bad day of cramps and heavy bleeding that might get worse if I do copper--or will it?

Also, can anyone give a ballpark of what it usually costs to get one of these? I'd assumed that with my insurance it would be pretty cheap, but googling it brings up some estimates in the hundreds? I know that pays for itself over time, but it's a lot to drop all at once!
