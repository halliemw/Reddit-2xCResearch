IMO = In my opinion.  Welcome to internet forums!  

I agree with you about not using weight as a compliment (except with the closest of familiars, where you've had deep conversations about it...which do take place).

So, one person can mention someone else's weight (at my workplace) but I certainly cannot, as I do not engage with the persons in questions in a way that gives me that intimacy (it's my daughters and one or two others where weight is discussed with impunity; my daughters give each other carte blanche to discuss weight more than I think is required).
