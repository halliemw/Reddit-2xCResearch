There are sooooooo many stereotypes about nurses that persist despite reality. People don't understand what we do. They do not understand it requires complex critical thinking skills, an ability to adapt, an ability to continue learning, to re-learn new ways to doing things, to manage stress, to communicate effectively with the health care team, to work out conflict. We aquire certifications and advanced degrees and many do. People don't get it because they want the fantasy of the sexy nurse giving them a bed bath. I am not a "cute" nurse now, I have been doing it a long time, if I feel like tangling to converse about it, if not I press the ignore button.
