I am in a very similar situation as you. I have always wanted to be really close with my mother, but it just never seemed to happen. Her and I are very tomboyish but in different aspects (I love video games and hanging with the guys and she loves cars)- yet there was never really any connect or similarities between us outside of being.. 'not girly'. We never have anything to talk about that isn't the weather, cats or my job.

When I was younger, maybe around 16 or 17, I asked my mom why we weren't friends, flat out. I am pretty sure it kind of came out after an argument, and I recall her saying something along the lines of "I am not your friend, I am your mother". It really bothered me for a while, to the point where I brought it up again when I moved out at 21. She said the same thing, but added something rude at the end "if you can't accept that, then I don't know what to tell you, nothing has changed."

My mom has always been kind of harsh, and I've just learned to accept that. Not to lessen your problems (or to turn this into a rant, although it feels like I am doing that), but at least you haven't had to experience the sadness of your mother straight up telling you she doesn't want to be your friend. It seems as if your mother might be taking a more emotionally manipulated route.

 Granted, I'm a bit younger than you are, so maybe my mom still sees me as a child (I did wind up moving back in with her, so things are a little rough), but I hope one day she decides to open up to me. I'll always be waiting for that.
