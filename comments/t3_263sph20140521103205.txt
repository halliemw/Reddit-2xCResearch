A friend of mine had the same problem with her ex-boyfriend when she had sex with him without condoms. She went to the hospital many times because of that. The doctors told her it might be because of the pH of her boyfriend's sperm (it was too basic). It unbalanced her vagina pH which resulted in the spreading of bacteria causing infection. Now that she has a new boyfriend it doesn't happen anymore. 
It might be different for you because you already suffered many times before of UTI. I just wanted to mention it, in case it could  help you better understand why it happens.
