I used craigslist to find apartments and was successful. This took place 1-2 years ago, in a college town where, just as you describe, living directly on campus was too expensive. However, I consider myself pretty sharp at detecting fraud or red flags.

No steps will guarantee your safety, but here are some suggestions:

* You have to see the place. You have to get everything in writing. One of the places I was trying to see turned out to be a Nigerian scam (became obvious very quickly when they couldn't show me the place). But even if the place exists, make sure everything is discussed ahead of time, make sure everything is in writing, and make sure you understand how your point of contact is related to the building (are they subletting to you? are they the owner? family of owner?)
* Tell people where you are going. I would let my boyfriend know by email or chat the time, address, phone number, other information when I would go look at prospective places. Or bring somebody along if you can.
* Keep your eyes open when you visit the place. Look for little clues about cleanliness, potential drug use, whatever might be important to you.
* Ask about financial situation. I filtered a lot of places just by asking about financial situation gently. One guy was clearly jobless and in desperate financial straits because his roommate had moved out. I didn't want to be saddled with his problems. You have to make sure the rental agreement won't make you responsible jointly for the rent, so that if a roommate falls behind you will have to pay up or be evicted too. There are places that do that. You also don't want to end up being responsible for finding the next roommate...ideally you want a rental agreement that extends exactly for the duration of your stay. Admittedly month to month is tricky to find in many places.
* Do a google search. I found the perfect duplex that was too good to be true. Turns out a registered sex offender lives in the other unit. The state registry even listed some details on his crime and they didn't seem very pretty. I decided to pass.
* Make a list of questions to ask to keep you organized and not let anyone's smooth talking ability charm you out of clear thinking. I did this with my craiglist search for a car as well. Very helpful technique.
* Finally, if it makes you feel safer, just pick a certain type of roommate. I lived one year with people who were all my age +/- a few years, recent college grads. Then I lived a few months in a home with a family. A lot of my choice was based on my first impressions of these people, but I picked well and they were all quiet, decent people who didn't bring any drama in to my life.
