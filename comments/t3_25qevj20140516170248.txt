You don't need classes to learn how to compete and men aren't our enemies. We are not that incompetent so as to need classes to learn how to compete. It is this perpetual victim complex that women seem to be encouraged by feminists to have that is holding us back. Feminists keep sounding the oppression olympics alarm, that will wear down any woman's psyche. Just go out there and build what you want. People will compete against you because that is life. The whole world isn't out to get you, that is paranoia.
