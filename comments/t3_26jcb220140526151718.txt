If you make it reddit based, you should make it in a private sub-reddit. You could start with people who are trusted members of reddit/communities, say someone like Maxxters wanted to be the 'den-mother' for her area - she's well known not just around the /r/sex sub reddit, but as a jounalist in her own right. People outside of Reddit could also be contacted and contactable through something, eg. skype. They would have to provide information to get into the sub-reddit; the sort of information you would want before you let them take care of your kids. Mods should be people who can't 'burn' their account as easily and you should require a certain amount of time/karma on the account to enter. But you could contact a mod if you were in need and have some form of quick verification for those who need the place to stay.
