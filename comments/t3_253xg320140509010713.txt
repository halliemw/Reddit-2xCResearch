I'm sorry you're feeling sad. :( But listen, first of all, congratulations on your engagement! How wonderful that you're in love and planning to make a commitment like that.

Second: not everyone chooses to have bridesmaids. I've been to several where there was just a maid of honor, and not everyone even needs that! The day belongs to you and your fiance, and you can make of it whatever you want.

Third: are you sure you want a wedding at all? There's nothing wrong with just stealing off with your fiance and getting hitched on a weekend away together. Eloping can actually be romantic and fun, and it's a lot cheaper (and less work) than a big party, especially if the big party is not something you want. Of course, this option won't work for everyone -- I understand about family pressures, and of course I have no idea what your fiance might want -- but it's just something to think about.
