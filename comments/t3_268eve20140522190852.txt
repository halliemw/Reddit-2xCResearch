That's why I think he'll be so upset if I do tell him, because he understands the importance of consent, and also knows that my consent being violated in the previous relationship was a big deal for me.

I do understand that I shouldn't feel responsible for his feelings, but I wonder if talking to him about this would do more harm than good?

While I do think from a strictly legal point of view this probably was rape, as I was unable to consent, I don't think I can view it that way in my head, if that makes sense?  I've struggled with this a lot, and came to the conclusion that it would likely destroy my relationship with him if I consciously referred to it as rape.  I know that's probably weird.

I see a counselor on a regular basis already.  I think I will discuss this at my appointment next week.  Thank you for your comment, I really appreciate it.
