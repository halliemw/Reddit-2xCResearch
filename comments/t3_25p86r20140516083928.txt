For a different perspective from everyone else here, there are some people who are simply more laidback about these types of things. Maybe they were taking snapchats and sending it to her just for laughs?  Maybe they have an ongoing joke you don't know about? You might not be sure what type of relationship these friends have with her. 

What they did was not classy but it was also harmless and you might have overreacted. You didn't do anything wrong by telling off those people and your intentions are in the right place but she might just have some misplaced feelings about you right now. The best thing to do is to just casually talk to your friend and ask her if she was bothered or offended by it. If she just brushes it off, it could easily be that you're over thinking the entire situation and no one actually cares what happened.
