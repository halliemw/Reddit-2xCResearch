I used to have a boss that this happened with.  She and I looked *alot* alike though (in both body and face), used the many of the same mannerisms, even sounded alike. 

We laughed about it. I certainly didn't see any reason to make a big deal out of it. So I can't really answer how to handle it if you find it offensive.
