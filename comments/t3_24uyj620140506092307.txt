That's pretty much what my resignation letter said. However she is insistent that we meet face to face. If it were just me that was effected, I'd be happy to let it go. However, there are many good people that I care about that I'm leaving behind and I feel that I need to use this opportunity to speak up for them. She needs to know that her behavior is inappropriate and unprofessional!
