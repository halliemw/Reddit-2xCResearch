Just so you know, it's not a common occurrence, but it happens. Happened to me twice. Dudes don't talk about it. We don't talk about it. We just leave, run home into the shower, squat, feel around while simultaneously falling into a shame spiral, grab, yank, and hope what comes out is the tampon and not something you'll need down the road.
