I'm so so so sorry to hear that. If he was anything like me, he loved you with every bit of himself, from the moment he first saw you open your eyes, he was amazed at the possibility that the world held.  In the days, weeks, months afterwards, he was awed at the fact that something so incredibly small could capture him so completely. He would watch you as you slept, and marvel at the fact that the universe brought him such beauty...and when he knew he had to leave, leaving you was the roughest thing he ever had to do, but he left happy that he had gotten to see those six years, that he had gotten to get some small glimpse of who you would one day become. 

...I'm really really sorry for what you have gone through, and I hope that life brings you joy and happiness.
