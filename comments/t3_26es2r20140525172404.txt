Hi there, please forgive me using a semi-throwaway. I had a BR when I was 22. Went from DD to B.  SO HAPPY I DID IT!  I was immediately happy. I remember waking up from the surgery and raising my arm to my chest, feeling the tube-top of bandages, and small breasts! It was a great moment. All that hassle and discomfort and feeling like a freak - GONE. Loved it loved it loved it.  No complications, just normal healing time.  The scars are like an anchor shape - a 'smile' underneath the boob, a vertical line from the center bottom up to the areola, and a circle around the areola (they reduced the size of my large areola's, too, to make them proportional with my boobs). Bonus: all the hair follicles from around my areolas were removed, so I never have nipple hairs. Only negatives: I sometimes get a little self conscious about the scars, and also I have to pick my swimsuits carefully so that the 'smile' scar doesn't peek out the side. But by far overall I'm VERY happy I did it. 10/10 - would reduce again.
