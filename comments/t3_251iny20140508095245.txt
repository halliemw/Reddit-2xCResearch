> At what point does it make sense to break up because you feel like this misdeed is always going to cause mistrust?

The funny thing, is I'm slightly impressed and I admire that he accepted that he messed up. That makes a huge difference and despite being disappointed in him, I admire him just as much as I ever did.

>How long should it take to rebuild trust?

I have no idea. I think it'll be fairly evident if he comes forward to me more often with things going on in his life (say, hanging out with a female friend, or whatnot) that he's making an effort. I don't want to sound like the type of girl who needs her boyfriend to check in with me every hour or whatever, but it'll help if some things are accounted for, if that makes sense.
