>As a new person to this thread (though I have known of its existence for a long time) I really like this back and forth. I understand how difficult it can be to have to justify and defend ones beliefs but by being tried it helps strengthen those arguments and really fleshes them out for those that have not heard the arguments before. 

>Ignorance flourishes where ideas are not challenged. I am glad to find this subreddit and looking forward to learning much and more.

You are unbelievably wrong if you think a single word I said was any kind of endorsement for your "challenges." I said I was happy to see my fellow women stick up for one another - I'm not happy that they have to. This is not a debate sub. Take it elsewhere.
