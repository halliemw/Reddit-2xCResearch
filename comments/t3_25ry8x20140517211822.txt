I know from personal experience how stress can totally kill your libido! I was under a lot of stress not long ago (I'm a trans girl and didn't know how to talk about it) and since coming out to family, going to the doctor, making plans, and talking to my girlfriend, the stress has mostly gone away and my libido has returned :)

Even going to a doctor and having a sympathetic ear can help a LOT. There's a free counseling service through my doctor which I am taking advantage of... you can complain, whinge, bitch and moan about whatever you like, and they will just *listen* and won't even offer advice if you don't want it!

A lot of people feel like seeing a counselor is admitting that they're somehow broken... which isn't true! Our crazy society is so prim and proper that it encourages us to bottle our emotions up, maybe your school has a counseling service which will allow you to release some of the stress? Just a thought!
