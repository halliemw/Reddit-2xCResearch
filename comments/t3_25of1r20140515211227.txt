I have one, hasn't stopped me.

Again, I suggest bear spray. 

> Location

At least watch some YouTube videos and get some friends together to practice or *something*

> Schedule. 

Make time. It's your safety and well-being. If you have time to browse Reddit, you have time to practice self-defence. 

> Allergies

What, pray tell, are you allergic to that makes taking a self-defence course impossible? 

> Other responsibilities

You are responsible for your safety and well-being too, you know. 

Seriously, what the *hell* do you think this is I'm asking you to do? One night a week for a few months... Max. Woman up for chrissakes.
