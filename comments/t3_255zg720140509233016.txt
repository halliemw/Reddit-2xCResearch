Dude.. write them letters... no, better... Record video sessions of you talking these things to them. In all of it, let them know that you love them no matter what they do or don't do in life. I'm a dad of 2 girls and I would do this if I was in your position. Also, I am sooooo incredibly sorry that you have to go through this man :(
