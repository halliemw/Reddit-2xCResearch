I've had both experiences -- a complete lack of admin response when we (a mod team of a fairly large sub) really could have used the help, and also an unexpected level of admin care and concern about something I expected them to brush off.  I obviously have no knowledge of the inner workings of reddit, but I wonder if it was just kind of a luck and timing thing.
