I have been using the nuva ring consistently for over 5 years now. The initial adjustment phase when I began using it was the most challenging. I had heavy periods that seemingly lasted a couple months straight. I almost gave  up and tried something new but after discussing it with my doctor, I decided to stick it out. I am very glad I did! I am on the three week plan, meaning I change my ring every three weeks without a week off. I have not had a period since my initial start. It's extremely nice not to mess with! I have little to no side effects.
