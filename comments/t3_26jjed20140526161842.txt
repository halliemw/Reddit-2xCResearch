Call the police to file a police report. They might not be able to catch this guy right now, but they can increase patrols to catch him the next time he tries to break into a house. 

Did he climb into a fire escape or how did he get into the window? Might be good to look into ways of securing the window while still being able to have it open. A block of wood or stopper so it only opens a few inches might make it safer to have the windows open.
