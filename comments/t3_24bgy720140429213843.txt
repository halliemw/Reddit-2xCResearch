Yes, it's sexist, but so are many strip clubs.  

Quite frankly, that would not have been a safe environment for you because you are female.  That's a place for women to be oggled and objectified for cash.  Not taking into account the legal implications of taking a person into an environment known to be unsafe for him or her, he honestly is trying to keep you safe.  

Also, from a business standpoint it's a bad idea.  If you have a potential client that's a known racist, you wouldn't send two black people to represent your company if you want to make a successful transaction.  Likewise, this potential client is a known objectifyer (Is that a word? Sorry!) of women.  If your business wants to be taken seriously, they should send people the potential client will see as actual people rather than brainless meatbags.

As much as we would like it to be possible for women to go safely anywhere anytime, it simply isn't.  There's a good chance you could be harassed or assaulted in this environment.  In theory there's nothing wrong with you going, but reality is mean. 

Your manager may very well be trying to keep you safe.  Not in a condescending "little helpless woman" way, but in a "let's not needlessly and recklessly endanger her."

TL;DR  Yes it's sexist, but so are strip clubs.
