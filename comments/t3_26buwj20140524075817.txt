My auntie would probably just rant on about the health risks of being fat and unfit. Plus she used to be fat and unfit, but ran the London marathon a couple of years ago. 

I definitely just settled for the first guy. The second guy though was someone I thought was perfect and someone I still I am a good match for. I've never felt like I'm the best a guy could do. But I honestly thought I was the best person for this guy. He seems to think someone taller and skinnier is better for him.

It's rather dodgey as to whether what happened was illegal or not. It was still traumatising and has made me scared of similar things happening in the future. 

Sometimes they'll act pleased with me. But then like with university, they'll sound disappointed that I didn't get into a better one.
