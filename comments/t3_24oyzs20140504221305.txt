No. Sexpat refers to people who move to a country to indulge in that country's sex trade and/or carry on a sugar-daddy/sugar-mommy relationship with a woman from the foreign country. 

I think it should be said that moving to a country, finding a partner in that country and adhering to that country's cultural norms (however much we may disagree with them) can hardly be called culturally insensitive or racist. And, while I find fetishizing a group of people unhealthy, it's something that can easily fall under the "personal preferences" defense.
