>I'm sorry, I don't see how the 2nd sentence follows from the first.

So, what is it: women who have had sex are normal, and virgins are somehow extra-special?

What do we teach women about having their vagina penetrated by a penis that *doesn't* make them feel like they just lost thousands in value by being driven off the lot? That they are no longer entitled to be listed as "mint" on eBay? That sterility is no longer ensured because the seal was broken?

The idea that losing your virginity, however it happens, somehow irrevocably *changes* you can't be taught without giving women fucked-up ideas about sex and agency. Definitely, teach that sex is a big decision, and that you should talk with your partner and feel really comfortable with it. But that's not a "first time" thing, that's an EVERY time thing. That's not a woman thing, that's an EVERYONE thing. A woman shouldn't feel like she has less right or reason to make conscious and conscientious decisions about sex just because she's had it before... but virginity culture teaches us exactly that: we are worth *less* because we're not virgins.
