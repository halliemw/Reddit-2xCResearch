Thanks! After the last comment, I went and checked and my three weeks are all one color but have different numbers scratched on them. My placebo week is green. So I don't know if I could skip a week, and besides, I just got my period to where I like it - four days, super light, only day one has any cramping or bloating, and I don't really want to mess that up. This was really informative though, thank you!!
