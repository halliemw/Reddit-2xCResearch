It may be that the diagnosis for "female sexual dysfunction" is a plan exclusion for that insurance as many insurances don't cover fertility treatment and it may be a diagnosis that is listed for that. My advice would be to ask the billing office where the service was provided to bill with a different diagnosis code. (Like if she is being treated for pain also, they can bill the diagnosis for pain.) it could also possibly be that the specific procedure is not an approved treatment for that diagnosis. I recommend that you call the insurance yourself to find out for certain the reason of the denial. If you have any questions, shoot me a pm. I'm an insurance advisor. Half of my job is figuring out loopholes to get claims paid for members. :)
