I figured it would take a few times too. But now that I'm approaching a year, I just don't want to continue going around with grey hair when I'm paying to cover it up. I've also told him several times that since I am very fair-skinned, I need him to be more careful not to get dye on my face, since I can't get the discoloration off of my skin for 2-3 days. I'm literally taking rubbing alcohol and nail polish remover to my skin trying to get it back to normal. It feels like I'm carrying around a sign that says, 'Hey, I just dyed my hair!' It's embarrassing. Even though he was more careful this last time (after I asked him twice), my boyfriend still commented on how I looked. And it takes a lot for my boyfriend to notice something like this. Ugh. I really like this hairstylist, but if he can't take my concerns seriously and nothing changes, I'll have to go elsewhere.

Thanks for your advice!
