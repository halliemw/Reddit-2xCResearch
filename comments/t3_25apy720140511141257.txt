You know about "breaking the seal" right? If you pee too soon then it seems like then you are peeing all damn night.

ALSO if you pee whenever you have an urge, how do you teach the muscles to hold it? On  car trip, not near a bathroom, 35th in line for the bathroom ... sometimes you HAVE to hold it!

However ... your body and your needs are yours alone. If you aren't getting a UTI or another problem, why does it effing matter?
