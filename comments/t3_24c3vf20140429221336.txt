Humans have an incredible ability to adapt, even to bad situations, but we are terrified of change.  It hurts because we miss what's familiar even if it is bullshit.  People who have been in abusive relationships will tell you that.  The unknown is scary, at least with the bullshit, with the abuse you know what to expect, your're familiar with it.  The unknown is hard, we humans don't take change very well.  Plus she has been a huge part of your life and letting go of that feels like letting go of that part of your life.  That's my take on that.
