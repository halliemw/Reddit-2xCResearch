I'm so lucky. I graduated from Multimedia and Computer Games Development and went straight from university into a tech industry. My company are wonderful and even though I would love for there to be a more even ratio of men to women I'm treated equally in my work place despite my gender and my age.

I wonder if Irish companies have a different environment but other then getting the whole "your a woman who does computers" in bars and such very few other women in programming I've spoken to here have had bad experiences.
