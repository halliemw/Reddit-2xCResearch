I work with my father at his business. The only people who really know I am his daughter are the other employees. Some of the customers know as well and that doesn't bother me. For some reason no one has asked me if we are related and I've worked there for 2.5 years. My problem with working there is how he treats me while we are there at the same time. That's a story for a different thread.
