I would definitely encourage her to get involved in activities where being tall is desirable: volleyball/basketball is good, I would argue that rowing is even better (*minimum* heights for college recruitment start at 5'8", if that gives you any idea). Making her height a part of her that she values and that those around value SPECIFICALLY can turn it from a negative into a positive, even a necessary. Something she can't hate about herself because it is key to her athletic success and happiness. Or I suppose a modeling career might do that too.

Perhaps also encourage her to learn a foreign language so that she can study abroad in a place where she'll really fit in height-wise, such the Netherlands or Denmark. You know, if she's deciding between taking German and Japanese in high school... Seriously, living abroad where the standards of beauty are *not* you can do a number on your self esteem.
