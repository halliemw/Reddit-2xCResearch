Yes, please, thank you. Mods, can we make this a rule of the sub? I've not only had several of my own comments downvoted intow oblivion, but seen several other's comments past the hidden threshold as well, simply for having a dissenting, but non-provacative opinion! The bottom of threads seem to be littered with interesting and strong comments! Some boards have a HUGE message that pops up whenever you hover over the down-arrow, saying something like "Downvoting is for rule-breaking and spam, NOT for disagreeing with opinions". Can we get that?
