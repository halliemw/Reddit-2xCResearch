Using a throwaway because I honestly don't feel safe posting here anymore.

Who do you mean by "we" in "we can make this work long-term"? Is it the mod team? The people currently getting hundreds of horribly disgusting PMs? The people like me who are afraid to post because they know that they'll be next?

Who do you imagine will be left if you remove the default status a few months from now? This is the first sub I've heard of that actually dropped thousands of subscribers when it went default. (granted I heard that second-hand so I don't have the actual data) If those people are replaced by the thousands of people who create new accounts in that time, doesn't that kind of seem like the subreddit would be ruined permanently?

Why do you think that the brigading is going to stop? Granted 2X has a lot more of it right now, but it happens a LOT in every default subreddit. Some of these people have literally nothing else going on in their lives. Some of these people write programs to go through and downvote everything without them lifting a finger. 

Even beyond the trolls and MRA and redpill assholes, I would say that the average redditor wouldn't want to read most of our threads any more than I'd want the average redditor to read them. That means that anything that gets high enough to hit the main page is going to be downvoted like crazy. The only way to change that would be to change the entire site. 

The longer our subreddit is default the more people there will be who have that mindset but aren't smart enough or don't care enough to remove 4x from their subscribed subreddits. This decision is a lot more irreversible than you seem to think it is.
