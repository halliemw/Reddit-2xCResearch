I think men just don't get as much feedback on their looks at all, good or bad, women get a lot of positive recognition for looking attractive but they get some terrible things said about them if they don't look attractive to most people. As for weight, hormones do play a part obviously but there comes a point where you slip in to being unhealthy and that isn't a good ideal to promote, also not a good ideal to shame either, would be far better to just offer these people support to become healthy once again.
