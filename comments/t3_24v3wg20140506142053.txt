Exactly. I don't mine some serious S/M and bondage. I'm a huge fan of orgasm denial. I don't mind a little degradation. But it just gets to be so... much. To the point of being like watching animals, rather than humans with emotions and needs. I don't remember the last time I watched porn because the videos I've found enjoyable are so few and far between. And what's between them just... isn't for me at all. 

Sensuality is more about mindset than the actual act that's going on. You can do so much stuff IF the mindset is right.
