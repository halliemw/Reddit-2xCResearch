It's obvious you've been reading biased coverage, and filling your pretty little head with simplistic ideas. Here's a tip....dont stick to one source for news. Read different sources, and look for whats common, what's not. Look at different viewpoints. That's what EDUCATED people who think like adults do.



Im not really shocked to learn that you are ignorant about republicans in your own country. With that lack of thinking skills, i think it's obvious that  your ignorance is not limited to India. I think you might have missed the various rants in this subreddit about all the Republican nominees during the recently concluded American elections. No surprise there. In depth is not really your thing.

>I also find it very suspicious that the intellectual class of India is almost unanimously against Modi 

When you get your news from 2nd hand sources, and blindly believe it, you'll make false assumptions. Who the fuck says that the intellectual class is anti-modi? Congress supporters with poisitons of influence in the media are against Modi. SHOCKER! yes, tell me more....
