I don't know what your religious beliefs are, so this may not help you, but joining a church (or other religious organization) is a free way to meet new people and have a place to socialize at least once a week. Admittedly, some churches can be cliquish, so you may have to shop around a bit to find a good fit. Looking for one with a lot of people your age can help (unless people your age are the cliquish ones). Many of them will have specific "singles" groups, so you don't have to make small talk with parents about their kids. They also tend to be good places to volunteer and find other things to do. For example, if you like to sing, you can join the choir. If you like visiting nursing homes or serving food or even doing things like remodeling the local women's shelter, churches tend to be good places to plug into service projects. But again, this is totally dependent on your personal beliefs, so no pressure.
