That's a good idea, I guess I haven't told her directly that I'm worried about her health. I just assumed she'd make the connection. She gets incredibly defensive if I even question slightly what she's eating, or her portion size. 

My biggest problem is feeling angry at her for doing it to herself. She complains about her feet and being depressed about not being able to work or really do anything, yet she continues to eat unhealthy. It's frustrating. It's as if she doesn't see that she mostly did it to herself.
