It's very normal that you are questioning your decision about breaking it off with him, but in this case, I believe you did the right thing and you need to stay away from him. I think most girls after breaking up with their boyfriends have doubts that they made the right decision in doing so, but I feel you made the right decision. Stay strong and remember that in a short time, you will not be feeling this regret, and that it will be a relief that you have broken it off with him.
