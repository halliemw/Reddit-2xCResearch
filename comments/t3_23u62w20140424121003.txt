At 26 years old, odds are you are pretty healthy and don't have much to worry about!  But getting a check up now though will be a good baseline for what's normal for you as you age and help you keep an eye out on any changes that could be worrisome.  I'd recommend getting a pap smear, and also full blood work (which just takes getting blood drawn once before or after your appointment): cholesterol, blood sugar and complete blood count.  You'll likely be very nervous when you go (since you haven't been since you were a kid) and that's ok.  Tell them.  Tell the nurse, tell the doctor - it will help you relax and you're not the first person who has ever come in after years and years of not having a check up.  A whole physical, start to finish, even including the pap smear will be over in 10-15 minutes.  And then you can go back to your day!  Odds are if everything is in the clear, you won't have to go back for a few years.

fyi -I was diagnosed as having high blood pressure when I was 26 with no prior indication of it . . .so even though you are healthy, it's not a bad idea to just see where you are currently.
