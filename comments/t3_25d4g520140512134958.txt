Yea I'm definitely not saying that that's what's going on but iv personally been in scenarios like this, iv even been with an ex who accused me of beating her. 


Reading her post it's pretty obvious that something very bad is happening but I just wanted to get another scenario in there if it's end up that her friend has actually had a history of lies/drama etc.
