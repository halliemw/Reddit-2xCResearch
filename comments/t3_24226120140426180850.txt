> I want to go to college, he doesn't. I've told him multiple times this is a deal breaker for me, it's the way I was raised and I'm sticking with it. He doesn't take school as seriously as I do.

Is it possible he doesn't have the money to go to college, yet wants to go? Which would explain his mood lately?
