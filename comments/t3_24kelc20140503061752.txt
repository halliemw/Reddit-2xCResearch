Interestingly, I remember a lot of people saying that about certain photos that the Humans of New York guy took while he was in Iran. Photos of very stylish, glamorous women in mostly "Western" clothing with a loose head covering. People were saying that those women typically were quite wealthy and had privileges that many women didn't.

(Not trying to slam HONY, he had a lot of photos of women from different areas of the country dressed a lot of different ways. It just reminded me of this in that some viewers seemed to take the "Western" look of certain women as evidence of a general lack of oppression, and that others were pointing out the class issues involved like you did here.)
