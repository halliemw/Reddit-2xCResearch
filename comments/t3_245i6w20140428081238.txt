I don't know how much shoe size is an indicator of height, but my sister was 5'6'' when she was  twelve and has size 11 feet, but she stopped growing then! I on the other hand have size 7 feet and am 5'10''! So ya know, who knows what'll happen! Also, I am not super tall but I love my height! I feel It's more easy for me to be elegant and statuesque which is great because I'm a huge clutz otherwise... Also I like that it helps give me a stronger physical presence in crowds and things like that.
