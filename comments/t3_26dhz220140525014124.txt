I think the relationship could continue just fine. OP can't just write off looking through the messages though. That's not okay.  And the fact that her SO talked her through what happened instead of getting defensive and pissed at her for looking at his stuff gives him a lot of credit in my opinion. 

Snooping isn't cool.  It's just not.  You're likely to find something displeasing in some way. 

Anyways, personally I'd say both fucked up a lil bit.  Address it and talk about but don't let this ruin an otherwise good relationship.  No relationship ever gets a 100% A+.
