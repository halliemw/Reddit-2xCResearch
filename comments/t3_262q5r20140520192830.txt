If you have made your decision then don't tell him. If he supports your decision your relationship will never be the same, if he doesn't support your decision your relationship will never be the same AND you will have to defend your decision.

Only tell him if you are unsure of your decision. Then you both can make it.

As a man, if I'm not going to have any effect on the outcome of something as big as my child, I don't think its fair that I get a FYI...this is what I'm going to do. If I can impact your decision, let me know.
