I don't think anyone can make this decision except for you and your husband. You're right about the pros and cons. There's a lot of love and warm fuzzies involved with parenting, but it's also very challenging at times and is pretty much a 24/7 role for the first few *years.* For many people, the pros are so worth it. For others, the clear answer is "no way!"

As close friends and family members start having kids, you might find yourself leaning more in one direction or another. You might see them with their babies and think, "Wow, that's what I want." Or you might see them so sleep deprived and exhausted and think, "Never, never, never!" 

I don't think you need to pressure yourself to decide right now. It's OK to just take on a wait-and-see approach for a few more years.
