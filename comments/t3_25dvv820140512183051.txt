At a DV conference I went to in December there was a whole section on strangulation.  It is such a serious event, that it is considered one step below murder in terms of fatality risk.  


Also, many people that are strangled can still suffer fatalities days after being strangled due to the internal trauma suffered, so I recommend anyone that is strangled go immediately to medical help, and schedule follow-up appointments periodically until the risk subsides.
