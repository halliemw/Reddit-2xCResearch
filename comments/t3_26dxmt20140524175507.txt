Have you considered trying an IUD? I have non-hormonal [paragard.](http://www.paragard.com/), which I went on at age 22 after having been on hormones since age 13. I was on Yaz from 13 to 19, then tried Yasmin (heart palpitations) and then something else (made me crazier) before going the no-hormone route. 

Things about stopping: I didn't have my first period for three months after stopping. I have never been more upset at a gas station stock in my life. What college gas station doesn't have pregnancy tests? 

My IUD makes periods a bit heavier and other things a bit...mucasy. Cramps are horrid for a few months, but it events out. I'm covered for 5-10 years, and the co-pay was only $50. 

Condom wise, my fiance and I strategically tried brands in college. Trojan 'barely there' brands are actually not there. Because they broke. [Durex Extra Sensitive](http://www.amazon.com/100-Durex-Extra-Sensitive-Condoms/dp/B0009AHF1S) is the way to go.
