I encounter both sides of the antidepressant argument at work and as a previous user, and honestly I have to say it's a complicated and loaded debate. 

Without going on a long and protracted rant, I COMPLETELY support the use of anti-depressants AS LONG AS they are complimented with effective non-medication therapies. They serve an important purpose (whether through actual effects or as placebos, that's a debate in itself as to their chemical effect) in that they enable an individual to function. However, they are not intended for long-term use and to rely on them beyond that initial "getting up" phase without learning to cope with the thoughts and handle difficult situations and emotions is a big mistake, and one that big pharma are very happy to encourage. 

My view (both as a patient and with contacts in pharma and research) is simply that they are a short term tool to help patients begin to learn how to be happy, and should not be seen as a pill you pop to solve all your mental health problems (which is absolutely not what I'm suggesting you are thinking, but it's a common assumption particularly among those not affected by depression)... much the same as you couldn't just take painkillers for what turns out to be a heart attack - you have to fix the underlying cause of the pain.
