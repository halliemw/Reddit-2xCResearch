Oh, jeez. Probably...4-ish years ago, when a small kid (maybe 4 or 5) told me I was pretty. It was a funny moment, if a little cute that she felt the need to run across the road to tell me.

But I try to compliment myself often enough, to tell myself that I'm doing alright. I like how I look exponentially more than I used to (even if I'm still not super thrilled with my body and everything, whatever, I at least like some of it now), and it shows in my smile, I think. No one ever really compliments me, but it's never really been a thing in my life, so there's been low expectations on that front. I might not think I'm beautiful every day, but...usually at least once in a while, and that's a plus in my books.
