That's completely how I was starting to see it, I'm glad I was on the right track. She just can't see the damage it's causing to everyone else... it was so jarring to have her over at my parents house while she's so upset that she's not considering who else is around her-- namely my poor little brother who has school in the morning! Then she's gone back and nothing about those two nights matter, not the hurt, the embarrassment, or the fear.

You know you can always call me in an emergency, but I cannot continue to support you when you are making dangerous choices for yourself."

I think I might use this next time things go sour. Thank you.
