Hey there, legal professional checking in. Can't say I've dealt with grand jury specifically, but I've been around.

Relax. Talk to the prosecuting attorney about your concerns. They want you to present the best testimony possible, so they'll help you with what you need to do your best.

Try not to ramble... I know it's hard, I'm a nervous talker too. But keep this in your brain - give the smallest, most direct answer possible to any question, and don't add any additional information. They'll ask directly for everything they need.

Also keep in mind, since you weren't actually there and don't know the defendant at all, there's not much testimony you can actually give. That makes it much less likely that the defense will grill you, since the only thing you'll be able to talk about is your car anyway.

Remember: "I don't know" is always an acceptable answer!
