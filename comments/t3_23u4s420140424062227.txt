Good luck. 

My boyfriend sometimes interviews people and he says it's hard to see how they can be very nervous. It makes him uncomfortable, and also he knows that they are probably failing at showing him who they are (well, beyond "nervous at job interviews").

Perhaps next time you can try to see the other person as someone who is trying to do a good job as well (by selecting the best candidate for the company that he works for). And maybe it's someone who is sympathetic to you, just not too able to show it or to comfort you enough to let you relax fully.
