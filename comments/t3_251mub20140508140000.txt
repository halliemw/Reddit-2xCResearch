I think the only reason that most feminists choose that word over egalitarian or gender equality is that they are specifically focused on the female issues more so. At its core it is about lifting women up to the level of men in societies eyes in the areas that are severely lacking due to a long history of patriarchy. It isn't supposed to be about dragging men down but about leveling the playing field in particularly one series of ways. It seemed to me as more of a focus on one part of an issue rather than all of gender equality because focus is the only way most things get done and if spread too thin a lot of things get lost in the shuffle.
