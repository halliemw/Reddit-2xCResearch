I wish I was in your Women's History. The class I had I only lasted one day. My friend and I took it together. The class consisted of all women save 3 men. The teacher kept putting the guys on the spot, like it was their fault that women have been oppressed.

It was A LOT of man hate. I love men! My friend does too! We couldn't stand it and dropped the class right away.
