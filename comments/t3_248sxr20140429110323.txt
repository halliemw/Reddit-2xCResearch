I just feel like this keeps happening so often. Im glad youre okay as well though! At the very least, we know how to prepare :)

Oh, what show? As far as towns go, its pretty great...very self contained. I go to school here. Everything you could want is with in a 15-20 drive. The university and the mercedes plant attract an incredibly diverse population, lets just say there is some damn good food here. If you are into outdoor sports, there is a ton of great camping and kayaking, rivers and lakes every where. Definitely worth a trip :)
