I think it is important that we admit it and explain it, because kid's get that sex is pleasurable with or without our telling them how so. My mom was a head start teacher and I recall her telling me that kids 3 and 4 years old would grind on each other and sing sexual song lyrics to each other. A three year old doesn't know how to sex you up, but can sing the song, dance the steps, and on some level knows sexing someone up is a taboo pleasure - she/he has seen the video. The reference is so dated that you can tell I'm talking about decades ago - but the fact that kids observe and process everything is not new either.
