What mental state? The only mental state we've heard of being serious is him having Asperger's but possibly being misdiagnosed, and his parents were trying at least somewhat to get him help for his antisocial behavior. Not to say there wasn't something wrong with him, but what would *cause* that to happen? Unless you mean his views - views that came from somewhere and had a lot of people endorsing/encouraging them.

I certainly don't think nothing else matters, but it's *incredibly* frustrating that people keep downplaying what is the biggest and heaviest factor in what happened rather than just addressing it directly.
