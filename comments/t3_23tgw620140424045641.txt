I had BV once in high school (so, literally over two decades ago, but I think the main concepts are all still the same), and I was told by my Gyno to do white vinegar douches. Worked like a freaking charm. I had one of those reusable gravity-type douches that you hang (and use) in the shower, and just plain white vinegar (crazy cheap.) Just google "vinegar douche bacterial vaginosis" for the right water/vinegar ratio and you, my friend, will be in business.
