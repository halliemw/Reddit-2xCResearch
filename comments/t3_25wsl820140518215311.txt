Yes, of course you should go to the doctor.

But you could be spotting. This can happen on BC, especially if you are inconsistent with taking it. Basically, it's probably dried blood that's been up in your lady bits for a while, getting old and brown, and now decides to come out mixed with your natural discharge. Weird stuff happened to me like that when I was taking a BC that didn't mix well with my lady bits. It didn't smell like blood either.

If you're sexually active, it could also be a sign of cutting or tearing yourself up there. That's happened to me before too. You get really into it and, oops, a little blood. For the next couple of days or so, I got brown mucusy discharge that was probably the cut or tear or whatever I did healing. Probably didn't help that I didn't stop having sex during this time, and might have aggravated the cut or tear.

If you're in pain or it's *a lot* of discharge, I'd be worried. Especially if it doesn't ease up in a couple of days. Until then, though, just keep it clean, don't have sex, and keep an eye on it.
