If this were my brother, no I would not be "screaming bloody murder." I would say "therapy." This is my family. If it were my brother or my sister or my fucking mom, I wouldn't call the police. I want to help her. I want to help her help herself. This was a ONE TIME THING and I want to help it stay that way. Just because someone hits someone, doesn't mean they are fucking hopeless and should immediately be imprisoned.
