Oh man, I was exactly there about 6 years ago. 

I moved with my boyfriend to a new city where he had been offered an awesome job. I had no job offer, and was doing the whole scramble through Craigslist to find something. 

I had a *really really really* hard time accepting the fact that he payed our rent, our utilities, our grocery bill, everything. It was his car that drove us around the city, it was his paycheck that bought us furniture (albeit super cheap and terrible furniture) for our apartment. 

It was a serious struggle for me, and I probably broke down at least once a week over this. It did not help that our apartment complex was in a part of the city that was being only very recently developed, off a major highway. No places to walk around, no little malls to stroll through. Just our apartment complex off this giant highway (that I still hate) and no car to take me anywhere.

Whenever I had one of these breakdowns, my boyfriend was amazing at explaining something to me: a relationship isn't just about financial support. While he was the one supporting us financially, I was the one providing the emotional support that had encouraged him to move out of his parents house and off to this city where we knew *no one* and *nothing*. I was the one making our apartment a home, cooking us dinner and keeping the place (mostly) clean. 

It took a long time for that to really sink in, but when it did I stopped freaking out.
