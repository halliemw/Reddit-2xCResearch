On health, weight, and self esteem:

When I was in highschool, a teacher/family friend told me that if I got too skinny, it could cause problems when I was older and wanted to have kids.  They had never said anything like that in school before and it stuck to me.  It caused me to realize I wanted to strive for a healthy goals rather than look super skinny.

I think I wouldve enjoyed a class on how and why to stay healthy. Also it wouldnt hurt to show them some stuff like the Dove Movement videos.
