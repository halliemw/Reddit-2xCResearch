Look, it isn't just the life principles. I love God and yes, I place Him above other relationships. I know you think that is selfish, but it is how I prioritize my life. If the person I wanted to marry didn't understand why I would do that or thought that it was selfish to put an "imaginary" person above them, that would hurt me and the relationship deeply. 

I'm not shunning non-Christians because I believe they are evil or going to hell. I think God works in ways I don't understand and I can't say what is in a single person's heart. But I do want a spiritual connection with the person I am romantically involved with. I want to talk about the afterlife, pray together, read scripture verses to each other for encouragement, and raise our kids in a Christian environment. Those aren't principles to live by, they are beliefs. And they are important to me. 

If the person can't understand why they are important, then that is a deal breaker for me.
