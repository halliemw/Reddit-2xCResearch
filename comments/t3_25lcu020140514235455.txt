I have an Edwardian hybrid frame, I wear ankle length maxi skirts all the time on it and they have never been eaten, but its a very hard frame to get used to.

The fit of the bike is what is important, gender is irrelevant because OP said, she is human shaped, and guess what? humans come in a lot of different shapes, so do bikes.

I had a trail bike for a long time, its what I was taught to ride on, 'boy frame' or 'girl frame' it didn't matter, the handblebars were too far from the seat, the seat was too parallel to the pedals and the frame required a hunched over position.

That wasn't right for *my* body. I have a short torso, a bad back, a hip deformity and frozen shoulder, what I needed was handle bars right in my face to take pressure of my shoulders and back, and pedals a good 30cm away from the seat so my hips are always in a seated position, and thus encouraged an upright posture.

I went with an Edwardian frame because they were designed for women in corsets. That's what I needed. My partner also rides a girls bike, he has a girls road bike because when he was a young boy he nutted himself on the crossbar of his boys bike and now he never buys bikes with a cross bar because he fears it will happen again.
