Novelty-seeking personalities are often correlated with high dopaminergic activity in the brain. The constant need for novelty and change may just be the way you're wired to some extent. 

When you drink alcohol, do you notice your need for change and novelty suppresses itself? Alcohol is a light dopamine-suppressor. If you find that it does, you might benefit from getting on Xanax or Valium, and find that your need for constant change diminishes with the corresponding alteration in your brain chemistry.
