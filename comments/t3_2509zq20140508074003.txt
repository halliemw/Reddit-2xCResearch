I've honestly been more bullied/gotten more mean responses here than I have anywhere else on Reddit.  Then again, I don't do much with the big subreddits, just a few small ones that cater to my interests.

If you don't agree with the twox hivemind, you get downvoted and/or people are nasty to you.  I remember one argument I had with someone about how it's OK to not want to sleep around.  They were SURE that everyone wanted to sleep around and if not, they were being slut shamey or something like that.  It was a while ago, so I don't remember everything.
