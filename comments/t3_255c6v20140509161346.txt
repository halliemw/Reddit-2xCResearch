The examples you've gotten from everyone else are probably better than I could do :)

Street harassment is a really good one, actually. A lot of times in more widespread threads you see guys complaining that women are too sensitive and they can't [compliment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/253vki/sexual_harassment_needs_to_stop/chdsr1h) anything anymore (there was a [pic](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/252git/a_guide_to_complimenting_women_and_men/) just yesterday of regions you can compliment on men vs women in /r/funny). The people saying that harassment is different get shut down by people saying they just don't know how to take a compliment from someone awkward.

You build up a good gut feeling for what's genuine and what's creepy from dealing with a lot of less subtle interactions. A lot of the [people](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ciyt5/cat_calling_boob_staring_lude_comments_opinions/c0sw50r) questioning others' interpretations or experiences are [people](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2525o7/what_can_i_do_in_future_situations_like_this/chdarvf) who have [not](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ciyt5/cat_calling_boob_staring_lude_comments_opinions/c0yolbw) had those educational interactions, so don't know how to recognize the more subtle ones so don't see how common they are.

But! It's completely and totally possible for a [guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2533ap/tomorrow_im_cutting_my_hair_for_charity_i_had_an/chde8dz) to call someone else out on that shit, and it helps the community as a whole for it to be *everyone* saying "that's not ok"
