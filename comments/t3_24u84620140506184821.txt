Well, it depends. The Dark Knight, for instance, is a combination of three of the best Batman stories ever written. I don't think it's a coincidence that that one was the most artistically successful of the three. Man of Steel takes after a number of Superman stories as well. The Avengers is loosely based on the first Avengers story in which they fight Loki. Captain America 2 is based on the most celebrated Captain America storyline. This is true for a number of these movies. Particularly the most successful ones. It's pretty rare that a successful comic book movie invent a mythology for its character from whole cloth, which is what you would be doing with Wonder Woman. There are a few other characters who are far more deserving of the movie treatment. I think WW is just glommed on to because she's the most recognizable one. 

Out of curiosity, does your username come from the David Mazzuchelli comic?
