You have heard of 16 and pregnant, haven't you?

I don't think that expectation is really there anymore as people just fire out kids without thinking long term. 'Oh I really want to be a mother, I'm only 15 but hey, YOLO.' 

Many people get pregnant at a young age and drop out of school or college to look after the child. They then need to get low paid jobs to provide for their child and are too busy to go back and further their education.
