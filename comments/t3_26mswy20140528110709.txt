Now, hold on. I agree with many of the qualms people have about BBT, but I take issue your with assertion that the "mainstream" nerdy stuff they reference is "out of date". Just because the mainstream Marvel/DC comic books and Star Wars/Trek are also popular with mainstream audiences doesn't mean they aren't even more so among nerds, or that they're somehow "out of date" - they've been around for a long time, sure, but they're sure as hell not "out of date". Yes, the show doesn't entirely get nerd/geek culture, nor does it probe many lesser known nerd subcultures. But just because you're not a fan of popular superheroes or SW/ST doesn't mean that all (or even most) nerds aren't.

They pick those things because they have a massive audience, and those things are recognizable by everyone and yet still distinctly nerdy. Not saying that's the right choice, but that's the reason.
