I had a bad experience with Wellbutrin.  

It took a few days for it to kick in but once it did, I felt "wrong".  I started feeling unnaturally happy, like my brain was having a fake orgasm.  I didn't like it but stayed on the pills anyway.

After two weeks, really weird stuff started happening.  I remember going to the breakroom to get a cup of coffee.  I had the cup in my hand, standing in front of the coffee machine but couldn't remember the next step.  I knew I wanted coffee, I knew there was coffee in there but I just couldn't remember that I needed to push the button to make it come.  I stood there for a minute, scared and worried that I was losing my mind.  

I bike often and started worrying that I would blow a red light or do something equally stupid where I wasn't in the safety of a breakroom.  Sometimes when I was alone for a little while, my head would feel like a balloon that would float away from me.  It felt like I was watching myself sitting there, but I wasn't in there with me.  I hated that feeling.

I told my doctor I was taking myself off immediately, but she said I needed to step "down" from the drug.  Certainly I stepped down much faster than recommended, but that experience scared me off of anti-depressants for good.

I'm not saying that this will be your experience or that medication doesn't help people, but after a few go arounds with anti depressants ending in Wellbutrin I quit for good.  I don't have panic attacks anymore and deal with periodical bouts of depression with talk therapy and self care.  Please monitor yourself closely (keep a diary) and talk to you doctor if things get weird for you.
