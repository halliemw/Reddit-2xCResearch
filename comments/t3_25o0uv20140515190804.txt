You know, no one ever got married (or should've, at least) after saying "Gee, I guess I like him well enough but I'm not so sure about this." *Everyone* is rationally confident going into marriage and yet we still have divorce lawyers. 

You say he's looking to move several timezones away from his family and that you already have -- does this mean you're not actually living in the same place? And what is marriage going to do other than legitimize in your minds the ability to have sex and live together? I get that you're opposed to living together before marriage, but what would be different about living near each other in the same town, or even the same apartment complex, while building your relationship up over more time? It's not like there's a deadline that you two have to get married by or they'll take you away from each other here. You can still build a life together without marriage for a while, and know that if it doesn't work then you're not stuck in a bad spot. Relationships fail for all kinds of reasons and love truly does not conquer all challenges -- it makes you more motivated to find solutions, but sometimes there are no good answers no matter how much you look. 

Give it time.
