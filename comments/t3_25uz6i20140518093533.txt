I see a lot of the technicalities of sex answered here and want to offer my two cents.

Sex can be awkward, silly and fun. You might make/hear weird noises, get yourself in funny positions, or even just start giggling out of no where. This is ok! I've always found it makes the intimacy even greater with my partner. It's like we create a whole batch of inside jokes that no one else can know about.

I would also highly recommend checking out /r/sex as they provide excellent threads. A quick search could definitely give you more inside (no pun intended) info.
