I've been kinda in the same position, except my friend just randomly gave me cold shoulders for no reason. I don't think it's right the way she acted about the veggies, especially since your friend should know that you didn't do it on purpose. The way she's acting is not fair to you, and I think you should probably ask her if something is wrong, because she owes you an explanation.
