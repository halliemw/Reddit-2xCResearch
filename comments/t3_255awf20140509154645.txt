> As these calls are all recorded and listened to by management, I would prefer to follow the rules because I enjoy my job and helping people.

I love the repeating one! The one thing I don't like about this is that this sentence is sort of implying she would be interested off the clock or if the call wasn't being recorded, and that could send the wrong message, not only to her higher ups but (mostly) to the sleazy ass caller as well.
