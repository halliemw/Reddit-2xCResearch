The study controlled for the women's age, so the man's age was the only one that was relevant. Men's fertility began being an issue when the man was in his early 30s, regardless of the woman's age. Men's fertility issues (and risks for genetic diseases) are different, but still significant. Fertility becoming a concern earlier for women than men is a cultural thing, not a biological thing.
