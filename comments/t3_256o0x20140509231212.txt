I personally find thongs to be very comfortable, especially in hotter weather. Putting baby powder on your butt and groin can help. If you find thongs aren't your thing, there's sooo many panty styles out there (like cheekies or tangas) that may work better for you! I suggest hitting up a VS or Target because you can get multiple pairs at once for a good price. Buy several styles to find what works best for you! Thongs take some getting used to; after a few wears you'll know whether or not they're meant for you. The type of fabric can make a big difference as well.
