This has been an issue with this subreddit for over a year, maybe even two.  The issue started when Project Unbreakable happened and, simultaneously and perhaps because of it, a bunch of other lady subreddits were created -- e.g. /r/TrollXChromosomes, /r/MakeupAddiction, /r/FancyFollicles, etc. 

The emphasis on rape/assualt/abuse and the funneling-off of lighter content to other subs resulted in a bottleneck where the populous with a more diverse set of opinions left for the other subs or just altogether. 

Many people have made posts like this one here in the past, even me (well over a year ago, I think).  And though these posts promote a lot of good discussion and are upvoted, things don't change.  The sub has just become large and hivemind-y, which eventually happens everywhere due to the bottlenecking I mentioned above.  I think there is a vocal minority that agrees with you, with at least the notion that we should be a subreddit tolerant of a diversity of opinions.  But there is a powerful, and perhaps silent, majority who vote with their clicks rather than their words and they upvote the abuse/rape/abortion threads over others and use downvotes to punish others with opinions that step beyond the range of what they think is acceptable.   I find the chronic and intense downvoting philosophy of this sub to be pretty disconcerting, but it has taken over and I really don't think there is anything to be done about it.  

I know I will get many downvotes for saying anything about the sub that sounds critical of its focus on sexual assault/abusive relationships/rape/abortion, because that is what has happened in the past.  I do feel that those issues are VERY important, but this sub no longer reflects a diversity of topics, opinions or a tolerance of such. It is the evolution of a subreddit, and I think it is inevitable.
