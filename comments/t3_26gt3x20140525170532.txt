Does she have PTSD from being attacked in the past?
To play devil's advocate, men get drunk and punching someone all the time and no one questions them.  And it is the first such incidence, and she is not an "abuser" right?


I don't have an answer, just questions.  Sounds to me like her parents knew more than you did and that's why she was put in a mental ward.  Maybe, maybe not.  But without divulging any information to her parents, you could sit down and talk to them and just say she's a sister to you and you need to know if there's something going on.
