Puberty hit me when I was around 8 or 9, and I can tell you that it is very confusing. You know what helped me a lot? Are You There God, It's Me Margaret. Shit you not, that book was wonderful. I remember how perfectly it captured the beginning stages of growing up and made it a little less terrifying for me when I got my period for the first time. That, and my family. They were so supportive. So you just have to make sure that you're there for her, and don't be too hard on her when she acts out - it'll confuse her more. Offer advice when she seems like she needs it, and try to integrate yourself in her life as the person she can come to with troubles about her body and the changes that it is subject to with age. My older sister and my mom especially were a massive help to me when I started growing boobs and a butt. Curves came outta nowhere and when I thought I looked ridiculous, they reassured me that I was becoming a woman. Kids need to know that it is all natural and for the best. Good luck. :)
