True, but D's art wasn't exactly S&M/bondage. It was more of the violent rape kind. It was incredibly explicit and extremely detailed.
This guy does everything by hand. His non-rapey artwork is pretty amazing. He inks everything with a brush and does the lettering by hand. Drawing, inking, and lettering a single page can take upwards of a month, depending on how detailed it is. The fact that he spent so much time and energy on a rape scene...honestly, it kinda freaks me out...
