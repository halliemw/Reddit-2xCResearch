I know that there is a massive stigma that comes with any std scare, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. I am 25 and ten years ago I was diagnosed with hpv, and had a few years of warts. Word got out (via my best friend, high school sucks) and I was ostracized to the point where I had to switch schools twice. This came after a clear cut diagnosis. Even though I had a rough time, I had amazing friends and a wonderful boyfriend. I gained resilience and hardiness that has stayed with me and allowed me to get to where I am today. By 18 it went away on its own. I went to college and have an amazing career. The people who tormented me? They are living lives more miserable than they made mine in high school.

As it is right now, you don't know for sure if you have it or not. Even if you do, understand that hpv among women is hugely prevalent.  One small, painless bump a year after the fact is not a death sentence.
