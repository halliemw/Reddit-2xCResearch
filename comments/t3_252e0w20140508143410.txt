Sexual violence is fucking terrible but I don't understand how banning it from books will do anything. Are people supposed to be forbidden from using sexual violence in anything they write or produce? It's a product of the time and atmosphere of the book. There is a difference between "oh haha rape out of nowhere" and "this is a very violent aggressive setting and you need to understand that". What would happen if you took the murder, racism and extortion out of "Heart of Darkness"?
