I just think your expectations are a little unreasonable. It's a massive influx of people, and it's only been like two days... if you dump a bucket of water into a bathtub, it's going to slosh around a little before it settles. I think that the gross-out IFF is part of the sloshing. 

I laughed when you interpreted my lack of doomsday freaking out as me suggesting that users should be thankful to receive creepy PMs, or that I support outright dismissal of women's voices, or whatever. wtf? I'm not stressing about this, I'm sorry you are. Unless you like being really stressed, in which case, enjoy.
