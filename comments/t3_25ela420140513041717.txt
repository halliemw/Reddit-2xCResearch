When I breastfed in public (not in the USA, tough), the very first few times I felt awkward and needed to be turned away for latching on - during nursing, hardly anything is visible and I can't imagine it being more discreet with using a covver (and seeing the baby fight the cover while mom struggles to adjust all correctly).

Once, an older man didn't notice what I was doing, so he tought I rocked my baby when in fact I nursed him. I think that's a pretty common experience.
