I have Mirena, the hormonal one which lasts for 5 years. I believe there is a newer one with less hormones which lasts for three years, I think it's called Skyla.

Most of the information I found when researching which would be best for me seemed to indicate that Paraguard would be more likely to make my periods heavier, longer, and/or more crampy. It wasn't something I was willing to gamble, I would rather have hormones and a lighter period.
