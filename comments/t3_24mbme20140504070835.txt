Hello! I started off writing to people I had met on holiday, but also through Teletext here in the uk - a now defunct service on television that had messageboards etc on. I wrote to a couple of girls on there, one of which used to send around 'friendship books' which people who wanted new penpals would fill in and pass onto someone else, who in turn would fill in and pass on. You could write to anyone in the book and that is how I got most of my penpals as a teenager. I only write to two people now, but one I've written to for easily a decade if not much more!
