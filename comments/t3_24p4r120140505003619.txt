We usually eat at home, and my husband cooks (he's the chef), though I have some say in the meals. He's starting to understand that I need to make my own plate, which is good. He has a weight problem as well, and his portion sizes are out of control. Add that to the fact that I will pathologically "clean my plate" (damn daddy issues), and it's easy to see how I gained weight moving in with him, despite the fact that I eat more veggies and less fast food than I did before him.

I am also a big stress eater, and I also sometimes eat for concentration, though that is rare these days. I once ate an entire halloween size bag of laffy taffy studying for a test.
