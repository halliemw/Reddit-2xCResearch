I'm comfortable being naked in front of others, but I've learned that other people aren't as comfortable with nudity... it always confused me. "It's just a body" was my idea, but I guess most people turn to the sexual. If you're not exclusive with your "man friend," then it doesn't really matter what he thinks. You don't have any rules set down about that, do you? It doesn't make you a slut, but you have to understand that the vast majority of people see nudity very differently. Sorry about that.
