Yes I would consider this a cheating incident of a kind, but I would also consider that this was the firdt time something like this happened , it wasnt physical,and that he seemed genuinely repentant. Stuff like this happens sometimes with a genuine breach of trust. A few months in to my relationship my boyfriend did something that hurt my trust in him in a big way. I was honest with him about it and told him how it affected me, as well as the fact that I knew I couldn't be with him four my own good if this became consistent. His reaction was much the same as your so's, and we worked together to ensure it wouldn't happen again. 4 years later he has continually demonstrated his commitment to me and the past is the distant past.

Sorry for any typos since I'm on mobile.
