It sounds like you're aware of how badly your negative view of your labia's appearance is affecting your life and how much it differs from how other people will see them. Labia come in all different shapes and sizes and it's not ugly or wrong or bad to have labia that don't look like the cookie-cutter labia we all consider "normal" thanks to porn. I can see how having to tuck your labia to avoid having them in the way of normal everyday activities like walking would be really annoying and frustrating and unique to long labia. I do want to point out that the experiences you're having with sex are not unique to long labia or caused by their size at all. I have invisilips, where my labia minora are maybe 1/4-1/2" long. They're tiny, but they get really sore and swollen when I have too much sex or when I'm not well lubricated enough. What's worse, sometimes they get caught or stuck or something and basically flap in and out with the penis, which is **so painful** when it happens, which is usually when we're using condoms.

Surgery is a definite option and it's up to you if you want it, for practical or aesthetic reasons. That said, in the meantime I really think you should talk to a therapist about these body image issues. "Fixing" your labia may not be enough to make you feel as good about them as you expect to, and you may have unrealistic expectations as far as what the surgery will really accomplish. Also be careful when choosing a surgeon, because a botched labiaplasty can cause sexual dysfunction as well as looking worse than your natural genitals.
