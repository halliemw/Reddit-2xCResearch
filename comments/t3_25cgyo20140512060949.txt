To make it as a chef it is hard to take time off to have kids, you cannot take days off if your kids are sick, etc. Since women are generally the ones who do those things it is a huge barrier to an already really hard field. 

For a woman to become a mother and a starred chef she would need a partner who would do all the 'traditionally female' roles in the household, including being the one who sets his career behind by taking days off when the kids are ill. This is not very common.

Then she would need the talent, perseverance and hard work that you see of Michelin starred chefs. These are not very common either.

For this to work instead of one extraordinary individual, you need two.
