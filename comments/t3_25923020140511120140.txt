I'm hairy. Belly, legs, vulva, ass, pits, toes, beard, nips, and some two inch hair on my arm. I'm covered with light fuzz everywhere else except my forehead (excluding [Count Olaf eyebrows](http://files-cdn.formspring.me/photos/20130804/n51fe6855e63a1.jpg) ), the palms of my hands, and soles of my feet. I don't bother shaving, it's mine and I just don't care. Well, except for the beard. I do shave that fucker off.
