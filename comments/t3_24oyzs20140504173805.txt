I'm a guy and I've never even thought that this could even be a problem for asian women, I've known plenty of american-born asian women and they're really not different in any way from other western women. One of my close friends is half-singaporean and she's so sassy and funny and I love it. I don't think I could be her friend if she was submissive or timid or whatever. 

It sucks that you have to deal with that, but take pride in the fact that your existence is helping fight against the stereotype. You're showing ignorant people that ethnicity doesn't predetermine someone's character or personality.
