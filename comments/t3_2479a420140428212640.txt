I really don't think mocking or exclusion are things adults should do at all. I find the concern about men derailing feminist conversation overblown. Obviously the kind of conversation you have with a group of people who are all in philosophically similar places is different than the type of conversation that you'd have with someone who has very different beliefs. But I don't think the mature solution to this dilemma is to mock people who disagree with you until they leave.
