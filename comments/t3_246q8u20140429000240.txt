Mm.  The problem with only talking to her at work/school is that she may act/respond differently in those situations. Like, being pumped at suggestions and ready to leave , but becoming deflated and defeated at home and not follow through. Or on the flip side, saying she's strong and OK at work/school but really caving in and not changing anything at home. If I had a friend like OP I'd suggest immediate no contact and get out. Get out now.
