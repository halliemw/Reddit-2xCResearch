I thought the same thing when I first read the title.  It's just misleading.   And Ms. Halappanavar's case has been one of the most visible news stories to come out of Ireland in a long time, so a lot of non-Irish people have a strong association of Ireland being anti-women's reproductive rights.

And FGM was only made illegal in Ireland two years ago.

It's not logical, but it's a kneejerk reaction.
