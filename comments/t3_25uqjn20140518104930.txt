When they ask if you have a boyfriend, "I'm sorry - I don't feel comfortable giving out personal information like that."

Other times if it's the type that likes to stand there and continuing chatting with you quickly respond to one of their comments/questions and follow that statement up with, "Thanks for shopping here - have a nice morning/afternoon/night/day." It should signal that it's time for them to go. Short answers will also sometimes work in showing you're not interested in their conversation/topic. 

If nothing works or there are still some people that don't take the hint - you might talk to someone higher up and get their opinion on what's appropriate for you to say to dissolve uncomfortable situations.
