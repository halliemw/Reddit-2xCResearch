this sounds like hell to me, but i embarrass easily. definitely baby wipes. burying the tampons sounds like a good idea in theory, but wildlife may be attracted to it. that would be the worst. 

we had a dog that would take mine out of the trash (poor plumbing and they wouldn't flush) and run around the house like it was the funniest thing in the world. it was freakin disgusting, humiliating (lived with my in-laws), and i would not recommend it. 

i would try the cup and back up liners. always bring a bag with you to use the bathroom. bring baby wipes, a bottle of water, and liners. 

i wish you the best of luck
