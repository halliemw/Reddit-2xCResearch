When I was 20 I was ready to move in with my (then) bf. Fast forward 3 years, I don't want to see this idiot ever again. Why?

I met him while being away from my family and having little support from my friends. He seemed like a stable point in my life back then. When I moved back to my parents and my life became more stable, I started to realize more and more what his character really is like (and how I feel about him deep inside).

(Then again, there are people who married their sweethearts early and live happily decades after.) I'd advise you to wait with this marriage a couple of years and then think it over. If you're going to spend your lives together anyway - what difference several months and a pretty white dress can make? And if not, you can avoid a very, very complicated and hurtful situation.
