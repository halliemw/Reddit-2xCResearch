I dont want to brag but I get approached/complimented by men on a daily basis. But I'm by no means provocative or "out there". Now that you mention it, though, my boss always gets upset if my lunch is too small or if I don't take a full lunch break. The other lady has also talked about how I'm "so skinny" and she's not. They are both old and very overweight. :(
