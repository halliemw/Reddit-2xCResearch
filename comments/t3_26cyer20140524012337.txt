Ahh, man, baths are my favorite thing, when I have the time. Last time, I propped my laptop up on the toilet seat and watched Up, and put this deep conditioner thing on my hair. It was awesome! 

My friend was sick about a month ago, and he wound up running this huge fever, so I stuck him in a cool shower/bath, and we watched Kitchen Nightmares while I made sure he didn't like... pass out and die. Laptop+bath=super awesome, as long as you have some way to keep it *well away* from the tub. Our bathrooms are awesome enough to facilitate this, so... rad.
