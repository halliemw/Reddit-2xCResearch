I'm not married or have ever had to pick out the perfect wedding dress, but I've always found the concept of "the one dress" a little weird. I mean there are many great dresses in the world and yours is absolutely one of them. And it is only a small part of a wedding day, I imagine, and given that you like it, just a bit and feel comfortable in it, I think you'll have a great wedding day even if this isn't "the one"
