You considered extensions/weave, voluminizing (sp?) hair powder (I like Got2Be) or other such wizardry? 

I have a lot of fine hair. So... half the same problem you do. Mine grows long enough, but gets ratty at the ends, and lies flat on my head unless I use some of that magic powder. Can't go a day without washing my hair or I look like a greaseball. With the powder stuff (and dry shampoo if I don't feel like putting much effort in) and some back-combing, I can get some major volume, even despite the weight that comes from having length. 

Seriously, while I understand you'd probably kill to have my lesser problems, and I am duly sympathetic and sorry I have more hair than you... Take my advice. Grab some products (check out some YouTube tutorials first for product review, technique, and viewing of results on hair types similar to yours) and then see if there's not something out there you can work with to make it fast, easy, and more satisfying to be uniquely you. 

Little bit of research, people will be asking you how you got such great hair.
