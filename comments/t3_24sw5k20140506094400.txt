You already are coping! You're working through the emotions and adjusting to all the changes you're going through. Really, it's extremely stressful just to have your day-to-day routine change. You're talking through things. You're grieving. Cut yourself some slack; it's okay to be upset and sad. Don't add guilt to that. What you're feeling is natural and normal, and it will pass with time.

 Everything you do for the interim will feel like a stop-gap coping mechanism. That's fine! Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and get more distance between yourself and this awfulness. Every day you get farther away from it.

He moved on fast because he's a cheating twat. You're not that person, and that's a good thing. What do you want to prove to him? That he's meaningless? The best way to do that isn't through revenge, it's through indifference. 

Hate him for awhile for wasting your time and your effort and betraying your trust, but when the time comes and those feelings start to fade, just nothing him.  If you do things to show him, you're empowering him. You're on the other side of that now, and that's a much better place to be. 

Everything from here on out is on your terms. Be thankful you didn't spend one more second with him. Go off and live your life. It will be far better than it would have been with him.  

Maybe karma isn't a thing and he won't get what's coming to him, but you can't control that. The only race he's running is a race to the bottom, and you have better things to do. Let him fester in the mess he digs for himself. People who do asshole-ish things tend to surround themselves with other assholes, so history tends to repeat itself eventually.
