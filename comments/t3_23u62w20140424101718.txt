Not super duper bad, but if you have been sexually active at all, 1. a STI workup for your location (get your partner to do this, too), and 2. a pap smear, as this is about the time for you to have one. STI testing can often be done with a specific urine sample or blood sample, that's a good way to start. Work your way up to the pap smear later, and bring your partner with you to it. Inform your doctor about your issues, so that you can avoid having a terrifying experience, and book a longer appointment, so you can go over everything slowly. Any doctor you call will understand completely if you feel more comfortable with a female doctor, too.

You also need to get up-to-date on all childhood vaccinations that you might not have received, especially rubella if you are planning to have children. If you've had all of them, about at your age, you're due another diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus/polio booster :) Think about it: Preventative medicine means you don't have to go to the doctor a lot, which is always great. Also, consider longer-term contraception if your partner is male and you don't want any children. Other than that, you should be fine. Have you been to the dentist in this period? You might want a check-up and cleaning while you're at it, to prevent gum disease and tooth issues.
