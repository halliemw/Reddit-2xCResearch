The Diva Cup works great for me. 


My cramps are noticeably better with the Diva Cup compared to using tampons. 


When inserted correctly, there should be no pain at all. You actually shouldn't even feel it. 


The blood flows directly into the cup, so you should not get any on your hands when you are removing it since blood doesn't actually touch the outside of the cup. 


Nope, you just have to empty it out when it's full so the timing has nothing to do with if you've gone pee or not. 


The stem is not painful at all. It depends on how the cup sits in you, but I've read some women prefer to trim the stem so it does not stick out. For me, the cup sits higher so I am so thankful for the stem (it helps me pull it out) and would never trim it off.


You should not be able to feel it at all. 


I just got mine last month so it's only been one cycle, and it's been easier than I predicted. I'd recommend practicing a few times before your period actually starts, just to get the hang of it. It was actually great because I put it in the day my period was supposed to start, and then didn't have to worry about tampons or running to the washroom in the middle of being out.
