Well, in this case, I'm not assuming because I know for a fact the majority of problems I've had are with other women. It's definitely not all women (majority I get along with just fine) and I've had some problems with men, but the problems I've run into are with passive-aggressive women. When it comes to recruiting and the result of interviewing, you're right. I have no idea what it's like behind the scenes.

(And I realize I sound like a megabitch causing problems everywhere. Work is often fine. It's a lot of contract work and moving around. I get along really well with people at work, but the few times problems come up, it's a bit of a pattern. Even goes back to high school and college.)
