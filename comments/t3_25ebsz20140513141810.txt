I was in history; now I'm a librarian (I left with my Masters). 

The tl;dr version is that tenure track jobs are disappearing at an alarming pace, and the instructors are being replaced with adjuncts, who have no job stability and are paid poorly, in addition to existing in a weird outside-the-real-faculty limbo. 

If you /do/ get a tenure track job, most people will tell you that it will be about 6 years of very hard, very time consuming work. 

A quick search online will turn up lots of articles on the former topic, as it's a hot-button issue in academia right now. A couple of examples grabbed at random:

If you have access to the Chronicle (you probably do through your university library), just swing by their page and type 'adjunct' into the search box.
