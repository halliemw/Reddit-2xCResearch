I think the OP misphrased the title. If you click where it says "find bras in your size" and change to smaller cup sizes, there are models who are really slim too. I think the idea is what they're doing differently is not photoshopping these images to create that unrealistic smooth blurry shiny skin, or photoshopping extra cleavage in, or widening thigh gaps and narrowing waists.

That said, I definitely agree with you. Every size is a real size; it doesn't mean bigger or smaller.
