I just can't believe how hard it must have been for the woman to do that monologue. Then again, I don't understand how people cope with being the fat or ugly or creepy looking person that only gets sent out for those auditions. I could never do it. I don't give enough of a damn about fame to do it at the cost of being "fat loser" or "ugly friend" in the credits of something.
