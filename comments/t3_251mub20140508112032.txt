Femen are disliked by other feminists, not because they're extreme or topless or like making a nuisance of themselves, but because they basically try to speak for other women - particularly Muslim women who choose to wear hijab etc - when those women already have voices of their own and they'd rather speak for their own damn selves.

There is a reeeeeally big and glaring problem, now and in the past, with liberal Western feminists pulling stupid colonial shit over feminists in other countries and cultures. There is racism and patronizing and serious overtones of 'we have to save the poor women who don't know how badly they're being oppressed!' and Femen do this constantly, and they are complete assholes about it. I don't think the nudity thing would be as much of an issue if they weren't like this.

They sure as hell aren't mainstream, and there is a long line of intersectional feminists who flat out condemn them for being sensationalist dicks, and not actually doing anything useful when there is so much more they could be doing instead.
