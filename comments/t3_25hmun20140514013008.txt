Aargh, made my blood boil. I kind of want to copy paste the section below to him but I doubt it would make any difference.

Guess what happened when I told a guy I didn't want to talk to him, walked away to another seat (in a train)? He followed me and started yelling at me.

What did other people do? They started avoiding ME like a plague and soon I found myself alone with the guy. Got off the train, crazy guy follows. Me, him and a couple of people are at the station. Those few people basically either jumped back on the train (I tried to too, but didn't make it) and left me alone with the crazy. Crazy starts chasing me and I run out from the station to the street as fast as I could. Did the couple I ran into help me? No, they ignored me. 

So yeah, "personal space man!" works wonders!/s
