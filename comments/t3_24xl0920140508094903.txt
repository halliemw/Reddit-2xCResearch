OP, if you can't get away from him right away for economic reasons, go to PP or another sexual health clinic and look into getting an IUD. He won't be able to prevent you from using it, and if you play your cards right he might not even know you've got it. They have hormonal and non-hormonal varieties, and last anywhere between 3 and 8 years depending on what you get. Or try the depo prevara shot - another method that lasts 3 months that he either won't detect or won't be able to prevent you from using.

I agree you should totally get away. Him trying to get you pregnant against your will is abuse. However if you can't do it right away this might be a good stop-gap safety measure so you don't get pregnant before you're safe.
