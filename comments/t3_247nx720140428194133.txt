I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but I'm not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with the article.  It's more a topic of discussion. She even says at the bottom of it that indeed we need more women in the workplace to fix the overall issue.  Instead of outright saying it's offensive, maybe try to explain you're thoughts on the matter. There's no denying many women leave the workplace for family, so how can we make this an issue that no longer affects the workplace? I am a career woman myself, but am searching for the right balance between career and home life.
