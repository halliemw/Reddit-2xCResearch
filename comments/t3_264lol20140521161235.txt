Managers can invite women to "happy hour, sports games & tailgating". I'm not sure that the second "and happy hour" is always wise. Drinking with co-workers isn't inappropriate but it can be disruptive. There are always about 40% of the group that enjoy making that into drama and leaking it into the workplace as complex HR problems.

Lots of people were not hired for their capabilities to handle social situations. Normal businesses are careful about what type of interactions they encourage as a direct aspect of employment.

Are you reporting that a male coworker said something inappropriate (eye candy) about some other women (not you) to a male coworker in a situation where no other women overheard it? 

Harassment is junk like late night calls, people stealing your stuff, inappropriate and non-culturally condoned touching, coercion to be involved with people. Its common. Its a lot nastier. Many women suffer it.

OP. You don't have your ideas put together on this. What will occur is that the manager will be given some guidelines, maybe attend a course. You'll be painted with a colored stripe. Harassment needs specific events that happened to you and restrict your capabilities.
