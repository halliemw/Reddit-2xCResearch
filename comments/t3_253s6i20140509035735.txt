I respect your honesty in that answer more than anyone I've encountered. Thank you. As someone who is at that age where people's response when I say I don't want children is "that'll change when you're older" it's refreshing to hear that I'm not crazy for thinking it can do more damage than good. (Forgive me please if my interpretation is anything other than what you meant)
