It's something to bring up with a therapist.. at 19 it's likely that your hips are still thickening up a bit... I mean, your body is making a thoroughfare for pushing a baby head out your snatch, and it's also making energy stores to create said baby.

If you've changed birth control pills or depression meds then you WILL see a difference in moods/hunger/metabolism/ability to control diet

If this issue is keeping you from being happy... or taking mental energy away from stuff you actually want to care about them it's time to get serious, consult a therapist, and form a strategy for making it better.
