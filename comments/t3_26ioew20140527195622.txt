You know, if you say so. It might be, it might not. You might be the dean of a college or high school, for all I know.

But I have never been asked, nor anyone I know.

Maybe if they are on-campus job interviews or something, I could understand that. OR if the job was an exception, which I outlined previously. Academia, Wall Street shit with quants, Google, top blue chip companies, the CIA, shit like that, then yeah, sure. But Fred's Plumbing Company with 20 locations, then no.
