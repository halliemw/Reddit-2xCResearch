This is a fair point, but the NI NHS refuses to pay for most abortions. So in reality it would either be forcing NI to abide by UK law, which is against the spirit of both devolution and to some extent the Good Friday agreement. 

As for the legal argument. Yes it is crazy that a termination can get a prison sentence in NI, but not  because it is legal in the rest of the UK. The legal systems are different enough that things can be legal in one country but not in another. It just is ridiculous that NI won't legalise abortion, something it absolutely needs to do.
