I watch terrible movies. It makes me think "No matter how bad I might fuck up, at least I didn't make a movie about the Titanic with a [rapping dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxHNztg0X3s)." or "I didn't spend 6 million dollars to make The Room." It's suprisingly effective.
EDIT: Added the link to rapping dog.
