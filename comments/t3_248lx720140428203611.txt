I think this is less about what he's accomplished than about what you feel like you might have "held him back" from, which is how you come across, and I think that perspective is very wrong and negative. Did you consider the idea that maybe losing you (someone he took very seriously) made him examine his position in life and see that he could have been doing more for himself *and* for the person he was with? While your breakup might have been very hard on him, though he accepted it, it could have enacted a very large, positive change in his life from complacency (he had already found something he was very happy with) to motivation. You should definitely be happy he's been successful, even if the circumstances are awkward. Sometimes two people aren't meant to be together forever, because we grow and change as people, and the important part is to take something significant from every interaction. Perhaps use him as inspiration through your own difficulties? If someone you left because you thought he lacked motivation compared to you can make it, you can as well. :)
