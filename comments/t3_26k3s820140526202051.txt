As a male i cant stand TRP. It seems dangerous to women and men. Its almost as if TRP says that women are attracted to confident men. Assholes are confident so be an asshole. That's messed up. 

As for the police. They didn't just brush it off. They checked up on him and nothing in the interaction met the criteria to detain him against his will for psychiatric evaluation. Nothing they could do unfortunately.
