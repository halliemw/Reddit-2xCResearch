I agree with what the other commenters are saying, but, in addition, I would say that it isn't wrong to explicitly seek out relationships if you feel they are missing from your life. You're a lot more established as the sort of person you want to be, so seeking out a relationship now is different than a younger person trying to define themselves about a relationship. Don't try to make yourself into what other people want you to be. Look for someone who is what YOU want.
