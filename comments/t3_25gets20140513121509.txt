I think you hit the nail on the head with regard to insecurity and I hare hearing the word "gross' too, especially when women talk about their own bodies, and then say, "its just a preference' like they are al open minded and accepting. 

I think it is something that is enforced by women, and that women shame each other about. When I met my husband, the only thing shaved was my head ; ) I agree that guys seem to really like to cuddle with the softness of my body hair. 

Once a guy, 15 years ago, told me he didn't like armpit hair on women, and I attacked him, wrestled him to the floor, and ground my armpit into his face. It was fun. We are still great friends.
