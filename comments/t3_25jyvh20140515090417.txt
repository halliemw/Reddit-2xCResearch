I was just being flippant.

I hope you realize your path is not just about treating women with respect... when we open ourselves to seeing the world through some one else's perspective, and realize the many aspects of our lives that we do and do not have in common then we grow in our empathy. Empathy allows us to be vulnerable, to take a breath when we put up barriers around what we feel, and to express feelings unselfishly and to be receptive of the feelings of others... this allows our interactions to be more productive and allows us to be generous, and more receptive to the generosity of others. 

I grew up with mild anger and temper problems. My journey to a place of emotional maturity has been nothing but rewarding.
