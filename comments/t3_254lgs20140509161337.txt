I'm in the same boat as you - pale skin, dark hair, etc. I actually made my mom shave my lower back hair when I wore an open-backed dress to prom. These days, I doubt I would bother. It's essentially amplified peach fuzz, so it's probably pretty normal.

I also have some hair on my butt, which would make me self-conscious in the context of a partner. However, I learned that that's pretty common as well, when a friend's fiancee made mention of her adorable, fuzzy ass. She was embarrassed, while I was relieved to learn that I'm not alone.
