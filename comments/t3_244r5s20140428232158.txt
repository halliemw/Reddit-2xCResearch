Girl, you almost certainly can't just stop taking your anti-depressants just because things are less bad lately.  Yes, certain types of anti-anxiety medications are take as needed, but you're probably on something that required tapering on (and tapering off).

Look, I did the same thing. Going off one of my medications because things weren't so bad.  It backfired. My psychiatrist was disappointed I would do that without talking to him.

I know anti-depressants can messed with your sleep. However, this can be avoided (mostly) by taking them first thing in the morning.

As for the rest, give yourself positive affirmations....?
