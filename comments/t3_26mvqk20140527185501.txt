> Do they not realize their own part in it?

You do realize that the advocates of that theory *aren't* a part of that world, right? Men, as a group, do not receive any benefit when you have sex with "a man", singular. You're viewing men as a homogeneous entity, and we're not. We are all individuals, just like you.

Now, do you want a REAL window into some psychology? Think about this: what is the ideal male life? Yep, exactly what they disparage in women. Have lots of fun, random, party-time sex with hot chicks, and then find a nice girl to settle down with. Y'know, someone who is interesting, yet just boring enough to never cheat on you, and then raise some kids, have a family, and reminisce to yourself about a youth well enjoyed, and an adulthood well earned.

In other words, by doing these things that they struggle to do, the carousel-riders have *out-manned them*. These women have become better "men" than they were ever able to, and it chafes on their self-esteem and their pride. It's a brittle and terrifying insecurity; to be so thoroughly poor at the male role (or the perceived male role) that someone who isn't even male can best them at it.

I'm struggling to find a parallel to relate to you, as the female role has become so nebulous. There's no one thing that is so fundamental to women as "have lots of sex" is to men.
