Thats the thing, it USED to have opportunity to advance. And for all I know it still could come up again. My current boss could wake up tomorrow and think "Hmm.. I didn't realize how good at this AgentPapSmear is! Since so and so is quitting maybe she could do it!" but I can't gamble on that far fetched hope. I guess its hard because I love this company so much, I just got stuck in a bad store. Not even a bad store... One that just doesn't... Appreciate me? But I don't think it ever will.
