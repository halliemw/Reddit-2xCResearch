The only glamorous power couple i see in story is you and your husband. 

Your husband for inviting people over on a whim less than a month from surgery and that line (does he like *other* suicidal sports?)

And you for actually being strong enough to accept that, rocking the shit out of a one of a kind top artistically painted with organic ink, greet the people at the door and entertain them with your presence! I would have simply told them to GTFO at the door because I didn't feel well.
