>you're telling me you wouldn't notice if someone you're having sex with is suddenly still, unresponsive and sitting there like you're giving her a gynecologist check up? Not noticing someone not moan and tense up tight and breathe like they are grinning and bearing a root canal? If you noticr something is off, you wouldn't immediately stop and ask "are you ok?" Not because you might even think she feels raped but fuck, shit happens and people suddenly feel sick or nauseated or dizzy or have an emotional break down and remember their dog died or whatever the fuck. This stuff happens sometimes during sex and by far decent people notice something is up and stop and re-check for consent. 

No, I would absolutely notice, and ask what's up and make sure everything was ok. But at the same time, people can be weird. I know I'm not the only one who has been in a sexual situation and not been completely comfortable, but when asked what's wrong responded 'nothing' because you just kinda want it to be over with rather than create issues. If the random guy in the ally in your first example said "you're sure you're ok with this, right?" Right before you handed your wallet to him, it wouldn't really change that a lot of people would want to get out of the situation so badly that they would just say yes. 

>Are people so freaking unaware or not paying attention to cues to notice someone is seriously not enjoying themselves?

No, people do, but some people really don't show it when they are enjoying sex. It kinda sucks, but it happens, and you don't really know what you should do differently, and they just act like everything's fine. 

>If the positive feedback stops why the fuck would you continue having sex? You're suppose to enjoy yourself and at the same time try and do stuff so the other person enjoys herself too. It's basically absurd to suggest someone can fuck an unresponsive living corpse and assume it's consensual, fetishes aside.

So you're saying if someone is being raped they have to be totally unresponsive. How is that different that saying they have to verbally say "no" or saying they have to fight back. Do you think that nobody has ever had sex they didn't want to have, but they just decided they would rather pretend and get it over with rather than trying to stop it? You don't have to enjoy sex for it to be consensual. And you don't have to not enjoy it for it to me nonconsensual. 

>I literally am appalled that you think one can confuse someone who is frozen up by fear with an enthusiastic, positive moaning, grabbing herself and you horny woman who wants it. Really, man?

I never said that. 

>And if the girl is shy and you can't read her non verbal cues, by far the most common and decent thing to do is to ask verbally. If someone is inexperienced and shy and frozen by apprehension, like perhaps a virgin, it is entirely **common fucking sense** to go slow and to **repeatedly** ask "is this ok?" "Is this uncomfortable" " is this better". 

Yup, that's what I would do, but if they are really shy, don't you think they might just say they are comfortable or that it's ok even if it isn't?

>So is it a lot different? No it's fucking not. You're trying to put the burden of rape on the victim go signal and portray rapists as clueless bumbling but innocent idiots who just assumed since 9 signals were given than it's right too ahead.

I'm not. I'm saying that no matter how uncomfortable some people are, they might show no sings of it at all, and might repeatedly say that everything is ok. I've done it before myself. I know I'm not the only one. 

>Just because you took a girl home and she made out with you does bot give you all clear to assume consent all the way to your ejaculation. It's your responsibility as a human being to pay attention to the other person. And if something is off, then **stop**, don't assume ok. 

Absolutely

> Why? Because non rapists are aware that they are relying on implied consent and if it gets unclear it's your responsibility to make sure the consent is still there.  

Absolutely, and after someone asks repeatedly to make sure everything is ok, and the other party isn't showing any weird signs, it's not rape then?

>I have had my SO realize something is wrong when I had a cramp in my leg and I was pretending it away not wanting to ruin the flow. **he still fucking noticed because he was aware of me**. 

So if you were an amazing actor and he didn't notice, it's rape?  


>This is normal and expected. A lot of sex can end up with sitting on someone's hair, or indadvertedly kicking them in the ribs with an elbow, or positioning yourself in a way that hurts the man's or the woman's genitals or a million other things. It's integral to thr act to pay attention to what you are doing. If you are not and you fuck a frozen in fear person you are not excused from the rape. You are guilty of noy paging attention to the consent. 


Yeah, but as much as you can try to pay attention to those things as much as you can, nobody is psychic. You aren't always going to be able to know what a person is really thinking or feeling if they don't show it or tell you when you ask. Especially if you aren't in a relationship and can't read each other perfectly.
