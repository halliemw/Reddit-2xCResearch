I have been pregnant twice, and I had different early symptoms both times.

With the first, there were two signs. The first was that every food sounded really good. We went to the grocery store, and I wanted to eat everything I saw. I remember even wanting canned corn. Also, my breasts got a lot bigger. I remember laying in bed and telling my husband how much bigger my breasts have gotten within the last few days. I think that was probably the day after our grocery store trip where I'd wanted to eat everything in sight. I was on the pill at the time and didn't expect to be pregnant. Once I said the breast thing out loud, it clicked in my head... hunger, boobs... I realized I needed to take a pregnancy test. I was 4 weeks pregnant (2 weeks post-conception), and wasn't late for my period yet. I got one of those expensive early tests, and it was positive. It was only the second time I'd ever taken a test in being sexually active for about a decade, so my symptoms were just that out of the norm for me. 

For my second pregnancy, we were trying to get pregnant, so I was paying more attention to possible signs. The only early sign of pregnancy I had was a really strong aversion to smells. I was sitting at the kitchen table, and I was disgusted by the smell of egg shells that were in the garbage can in a closet. I couldn't take the smell and had to take the garbage out to get rid of the stink of eggshells. I took a test first thing the next morning, and it was positive. 

I never felt sick to my stomach with either pregnancies. With my first, it was mostly the boob thing, and, with my second, it was a super sense of smell.
