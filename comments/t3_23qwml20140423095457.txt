I love this.  My dad and I did and do many of those things.  We played sports, watched sports, and were the loudest people at sporting events.  We'd go to Revolution soccer games and I'd be hoarse until the next day from cheering so loudly.  Good times.  And he didn't need a son to buy a microscope for and to look at weird bugs from the nearby stream with.  And now, we love going to bars and having beer.  One of his big tasks in preparing for my wedding reception was to buy the beer.  We definitely had the best beer selection of any wedding I've been to.  :-)
