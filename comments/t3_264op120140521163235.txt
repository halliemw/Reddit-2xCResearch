Hi! I got my first pelvic exam last month and it wasn't bad at all. Not going to lie, I was super nervous that it was going to hurt after reading a few stories but my girlfriends have all had it done and they assured me that it was probably going to be uncomfortable but not painful at all. I didn't shave or take a shower before I had it done and my gyn didn't care so don't worry about that at all! :)

Your gynecologist is going to insert a speculum in you, which may look a bit intimidating, but don't let that freak you out. He/she will lube it up so it'll slide in more comfortably and this is just going to open up your vagina so your gynecologist will have access to your cervix. If you're a virgin or if you don't really use tampons, you might not be used to the feeling of something inside you, but that's okay. You'll just feel a little stretched and it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. Your cervix will then be swabbed a couple of times (this was actually the weirdest part for me because you kind of feel like your cervix is being tickled? Not sure how to describe it, but think of the feeling you get when you hit your funny bone). 

And then you're done!

Just remember to relax! Easier said than done, I know, but it'll make the whole process that much easier. I was a bit tense when I got mine done but fortunately, my gynecologist was very patient with me. Again, it shouldn't hurt, but you can always tell your gyn to stop if it does. He/she should also have speculums of different sizes available so you may ask for a smaller one if that makes you feel more at ease. The whole thing shouldn't take more than two or three minutes and you'll be done before you know it. :)

Good luck and if you have any concerns, you are always free to PM me. :)
