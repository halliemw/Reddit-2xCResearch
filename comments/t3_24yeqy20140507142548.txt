But do you recognize that people of color start out at a disadvantage compared to whites, even now? That even by just 36 months of age, the majority of children (both black and white children) prefer a white playmate? That due to generations of poverty and unfair systems, those living in the inner city actually *are* forced to stay there because they can't afford to move out?
