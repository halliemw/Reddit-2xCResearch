> I don't think he intended it maliciously at all. I think he was drunk and there was a girl sleeping next to him who he may or may not have thought was Kristen, and I woke up to it and with my history honestly didn't know what to do. I know this is one of those grey situations which is why I wanted to talk to the online community about it.

I know it's very clich√©, but the "If you're drunk and hit someone with your car you're still 100% responsible for what happened" analogy really holds up here. 

I wonder...how many times do you think he's done this to Kristen?
