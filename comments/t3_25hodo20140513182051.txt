Well, let's start with the fact that not all birth control is the same. Different pills have different effects, and there are non-pill options, too. She might consider looking at the implant or shot, which have no estrogen, and discussing all of her concerns with her doctor. And as for the gallbladder thing, I don't know what her problem is, but she should discuss it with her doctor. I will say that I don't have a gallbladder and I'm perfectly fine without it after going through some hell with it. The warnings on birth control is that it can cause gallbladder disease, but as far as I know, there's no reason not to use it if you already don't have a functioning gallbladder. I'm on it now. But yeah, she needs to discuss all of her concerns with her doctor. They're the only ones qualified to help her.
