It really is true!  I felt like on one hand, she was "saying" with her email address, "Come closer, I won't hurt you."   

But then with her actions, what was she doing?  Hurting people.   How can anyone believe what she proclaims then?  

It was eye-opening and I felt like I had a taste of what *I* look like from the eyes of non-believers, KWIM?
