You know what would be really handy?  A network of women offering a bed/couch to other women who need somewhere to stay in that time between the ultrasound/class and the abortion.  If there isn't one, we should make it.

Edit: after talking to my friend/mentor who runs a local non-profit, she's convinced me that we should organize this idea into a non-profit. She's talking to the guy who runs the Planned Parenthood in our state tomorrow to get their advice and gauge their interest and we'll be settling the details over the next few days. I'll post a thread with updates on our progress if you guys are interested!
