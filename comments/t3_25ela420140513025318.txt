Oh I am well aware the problem is just with me, hence why I would never say anything. My original point was basically just to say that not everyone dislikes breastfeeding as they find it too sexual for public (I'd actually be less bothered watching people have sex in public than I would be watching someone breastfeed fwiw), but just that some people just don't like watching it.
