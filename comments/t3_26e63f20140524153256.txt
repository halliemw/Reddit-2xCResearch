I've used one successfully, but the supplies in there are *horrible*. Seriously, you'd think that a company of some sorts would realise what an incredible amount of goodwill they'd foster by installing machines here and there that are easy to use and have good, comfortable products. I've seen many that are out of order, won't dispense, empty, etc.
