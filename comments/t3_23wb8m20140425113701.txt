Electric trimmer/ shaver is the way to go. I have the same issue with the bonus problem that my hair has "branched out" with age and now goes almost all the way over to my hips (sparse, but dark). I can't completely shave it off on a regular basis b/c of ingrowns, but can use a trimmer on the lowest stetting. It doesn't give you the super smooth feel of a razor shave, but it DOES remove a lot of the hair color/ texture down there. Also, you can do it every day if you want.
