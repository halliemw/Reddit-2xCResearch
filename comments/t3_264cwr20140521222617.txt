*Still, he talks about my friends, my co-workers, and other girls that he knows and says that he would like to sleep with them and sometimes tells me that he does, only to tell me later that he is just joking.*



My dad said to me many years ago "serious things are often said in jest." It changed the way I listened to people. Some people aren't capable of true honesty and they let this kind of repulsive crap fall out of their mouths and claim they're just kidding. He's not kidding, unfortunately. I'm sorry you've had to deal with this. :(
