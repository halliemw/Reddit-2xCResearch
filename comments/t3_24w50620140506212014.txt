No, I believe she's referring to the abortion pill (a medical abortion as opposed to a surgical abortion). Different from Plan B and other emergency contraceptives.

Medical abortions are only available very early in gestation. But some women opt for a surgical abortion over medical abortion because it's faster and they may prefer the pain management options.
