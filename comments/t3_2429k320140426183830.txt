What's the weather like where you are?  Go out and go for a walk or a bike ride.  Stop by a cafe or pub, get something to eat, something to drink, make some small talk with whoever is around.  Go to a museum or art gallery.  Do some window shopping.  Buy yourself something small but totally impractical and tell yourself it's a gift you totally deserve (because you do).  Go home a take a relaxing bubble bath, listen to some of your favorite music and dance like no one is watching.  Take pictures and upload for karma and conversation.  Bake yourself a treat and stick a candle in it, then make a wish.

THANKS SO MUCH for mentioning Agents of SHIELD was on again.  I didn't know and would have missed it.  Go watch that!  And Avengers.  And any of the Iron Man or Thor movies.  Take yourself out the new Captain America movie (and let me know how it is).

Happy Birthday! :)
