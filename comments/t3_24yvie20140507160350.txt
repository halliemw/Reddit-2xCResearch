I love, love, love hearing that. It's really so rare that people document verbal abuse and actually submit it to the appropriate places. 

When my stalker tried to interfere with my research I openly talked about him with my fellow research colleagues and was prepared to tell the faculty if he would have dared to be verbally abusive (in the email he luckily was only needy and distracting the research without being harassing so I never even had to explain more than the "strange email" my research team was getting from a guy that had a set up a google alert on my name and that I had never even met).
