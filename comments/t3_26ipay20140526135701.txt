Oh god in the spirit of this entire TMI thread, here's how a squeamish person like me empties her Diva Cup:

I pull it out and immediately dump it in the toilet without looking. Then I piss in the cup to rinse it out before dumping it again. Then I toss the mostly clean cup into the sink while I finish up my toilet it stuff.

Also, it should be noted that there is zero smell. I'm not gonna take the time to look it up, but someone told me the smell is mostly from the bacteria and exposure to air, which is much less a factor with a cup.
