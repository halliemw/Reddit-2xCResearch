I'm in the US.  It's a common term when talking about inappropriate humour.   Comedy is only edgy when you’re punching outside of your weight-class. When you’re punching down, you’re not being edgy; you’re being a bully.  Anyone can make fun of the disadvantaged, and no real comedic skill or cleverness is required to do it.

Making jokes about victims of domestic violence is not funny.  Continuing to say incredibly sexist things about women *while apologizing for said jokes* is not funny.  It's offensive.  And honestly, only funny to people who agree with the sexist views.
