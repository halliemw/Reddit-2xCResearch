If he identifies as a feminist, he should already know how important consent is. It doesn't sound like he got an "enthusiastic yes" from you, and it wouldn't have mattered either way as you were on heavy drugs and clearly unable to consent to having sex with him.
Him feeling awful about himself should not be your concern, as he was the one who took advantage of you being in an unusual state where it was plausible that you wouldn't remember anything that happened. 
I understand if you don't feel like the word "rape" is appropriate to describe what happened (as most people view it as something that has to be violent), but what he did is unethical and proof enough that his respect for your control over what happens to your own body is lacking. 
Just because you trust someone doesn't mean they are incapable of hurting you, or that they shouldn't be held accountable if they do. Taking advantage of someone's trust/illness like that is not okay, and I'm really sorry this happened. Touching you in a sexual way when you're on heavy medication is a huge no-go. :( 
Maybe talk to a counselor in your area to help sort out your thoughts (if that's something you have access to)? It can really help to have someone who's not involved to listen and give you advice. I apologize for not having more specific information on services in you area and I hope things get better for you!
