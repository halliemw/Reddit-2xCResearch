This is the same problem I have when people complain about the "friend zone" and act like a woman is a bitch for not wanting a sexual or romantic relationship with someone they aren't attracted to. Some guys (and probably some women, though I wouldn't know) feel entitled, like the mere act of them being interested in you means that you owe them something. Don't let it get to you. If they can't see that you have your own preferences and that you have every right to reject them, they're morons.
