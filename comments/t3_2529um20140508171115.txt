How was he so cruel?  She knew right away that he wasn't attracted to her.  They both decided to have sex, even though this fact was known to both of them.  The guy may have tried to get over his dislike of her appearance and have sex with her in the hopes of overlooking that fact.  But it didn't work so he was upfront with her and didn't lead her on.  He may have been too blunt but he was truthful.  He may have also felt very deceived by the pics op sent.  She may have been super selective about what she sent and purposefully sent ones that made her seem skinnier than she actually is.  I'm seeing everyone attack this guy and downvote the hell out of anyone who disagrees or offers a different opinion.  That's pretty sad for a sub that says it wants to encourage discourse and discussion.
