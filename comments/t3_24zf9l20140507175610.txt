Mine has never been regular and I've been on birth control since I was 15. I only recently started truly trusting it because I switched to Depo (which is /awesome/ IMO) and I feel like it'd be really hard for me to screw that up. I agree with what other people have been saying about the effects of the ability to truly decide what to do if it were to fail, though. The fact that my boyfriend trusts me to make the right decision if it were to fail helps too.
