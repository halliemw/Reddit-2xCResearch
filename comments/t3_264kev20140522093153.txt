Dress codes exist to give guidelines on what will not look professional (once again in my opinion).

I'm a rather large chested woman. I know the pain of trying to find shirts that close and don't show cleavage and trying to find professional attire that doesn't make me look like a bad halloween costume of a sexy librarian. One of the other bias the author includes is how a girl with a large chest will be called out as looking inappropriate in a piece of clothing and a girl with a small chest will not. That makes sense. I can't wear very fitted shirts because I look like a porn star, which doesn't look professional. Many of my female coworkers can wear fitted shirts and they look lovely on them and professional. You do need to dress for your body type because something that looks fine on one woman can look completely inappropriate on you. That's how bodies work.

Saying that though the whole prom thing is crazy. In my school when we had prom we could wear whatever we wanted. There were no dress codes and trust me after years of uniforms low cut dresses and short skirt were everywhere!
