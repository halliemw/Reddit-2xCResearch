I second the couples therapy thing. My husband and I started going to work on a very specific issue, and it unearthed the main issue we have as a couple - namely that we have terrible big-decision-making skills. Turns out we'd never had to make a decision when both of us felt strongly about opposing options. When that scenario finally came up, we had no idea how to understand the other person's viewpoint, or even begin to work on resolving the conflict.  
It sounds kind of similar to what you guys are going through - you want one thing strongly (him to go back to work) and he wants something else strongly (not to go back to work).  
My husband and I had to work through the things that were causing each of us to have such strong opinions on our argument. For me, it was fear that the decision could end up disrupting or even ruining our marriage. For him, it was fear that we would end up disappointing his family. I'm very protective of our marriage, he's very protective of his family. It really helped us both to know where we were coming from.
