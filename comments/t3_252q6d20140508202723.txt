Jesus effing christ on a pogo stick.

I have repeatedly asked for specifics, or some evidence that mods give a shit beyond easy platitudes, and I get handed more generic platitudes? I don't even.

Edit: Okay, with a little distance this comment is a bit harsh. I'm not removing it, in part because i think that's a cop out, and in part because I stand by this general sentiment. But I'm sorry for putting this in a direct response to one mod, because I don't mean to take my frustration with this situation out on any one person.
