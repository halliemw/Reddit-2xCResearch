I hate that this sub has been labelled feminist. It's not. It has leanings and includes feminist content, but the label is not inclusive of everything this sub offers. I think that the label definitely creates an idea of exclusion of women who are not feminist. I like this sub because it is *not* feminist even though I am. Not everything is political.
