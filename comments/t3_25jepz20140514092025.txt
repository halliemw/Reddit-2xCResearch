My mom & I are currently working on a 10 year project to visit every single town/city on the map in Oklahoma. On Sunday (Mother's Day) our first stop was Beggs, OK & we found a woman with very little time but also a really emotional story to tell. 

We're still working through the kinks of postproduction and how we want our videos to look/feel, but we're really happy with the content so far.
