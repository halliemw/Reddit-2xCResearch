Ugh, this happened to me last night. I'm not on my period yet but due any day. I was away for the night with my friends while my boyfriend is abroad at a stag do. I was fine all day, we went out dancing, ended up in a bar with terrible music (a man singing along to an iPod backing track...) and I just shut down, wouldn't get up and dance, couldn't even engage in conversation. Got back to our hotel, locked myself in the bathroom and cried my eyes out FOR NO REASON AT ALL. I want to go home, I miss my boyfriend, I'm being horrible to everyone, wah wah wah wah sob.  My friends must have thought I was just being a massive dick, which is partly true but ugh, emotions everywhere.
