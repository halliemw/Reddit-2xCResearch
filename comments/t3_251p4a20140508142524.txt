I hate that I'm being painted as some rape apologist. That isn't the case. No rape is less real than any other. Even if someone did get drunk, dress scandalously, and pass out it isn't their fault. I never said it was. I was only saying I don't find it all that heinous for someone to mention what a victim could have done better to protect themselves (in certain circumstances). Again, my opinion on this extends beyond rape. 

My school-aged nephew recently had $100 stolen from him. How did this happen? He took it to school and brandished it in front of the class. Later that afternoon he discovered it was gone. The theft was preventable.

I'm not putting the victim on trial. I understand people's aversion to question what a victim could have done better. For reasons listed above, I have less of an issue with discussing what a victim or potential victim of a crime could do to prevent what has/could happen. It wasn't my intention to diminish the plight of a rape victim or anyone else.
