Has it ever occured to people that maybe women dont do computer science because they are just not interested in it? I have a masters in computer science and all the guys in the were always helpful and included women.
Women just arent into it, for the most part and those that are into are most certainly welcomed. 
This whole drive is just another stupid circle jerk.
