When I got mine (in Canada) I had to pick up my own and take it to my doctor. The IUD ended up coming out right after she inserted it and not able to be put back in. She said that the pharmaceutic company provides 'back-ups' free of charge to doctors offices and she would go grab one from the back. That was the patient doesn't have to purchase two if something goes wrong.
