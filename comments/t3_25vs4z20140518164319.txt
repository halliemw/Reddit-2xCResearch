I can relate to a flood of horrible memories coming up after being through a lot of trauma.  That was the first sign I finally was beginning to heal, as I had to stuff many things down or 'forget' just to survive the many years long situation.   The emotional period of finally allowing myself to 'review' everything I went through I realized at that time "Oh shit... I'm finally SAFE now... ".    I am now anxiety prone due to my PTSD, but I at least now I know when my body reacts, the mind knows I'll be alright and will get through the moment. 

So in my opinion, if what I went through is like what you are experiencing it mean's you're on your first leg of truly healing.

As to having three children, yea it can be many things you describe but the pain and yuck stuff is temporary.  If it was that bad the human species would have been extinct by now. 

If you choose to have kids or not is up to you and the only 'right' thing for you is what is 'right' for you.
