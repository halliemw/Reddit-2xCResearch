It's not that I expect anyone to stop being themselves, it's just that it sucks being backed into a corner at my workplace. It wouldn't bother me as much if it was just an occasional thing that happens at some random place, but this is something I deal with 2+ times a week in a setting where I have to be nice and professional. 

It just makes me feel really disrespected (again, not all the time, just mostly when guys are pushy and persistent, especially after a lack of interest has been expressed)
