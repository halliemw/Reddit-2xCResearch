These work for me:  
1.  Lysine: I like [the cream](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3986312313991676623?gs_rn=45&gs_ri=psy-ab&tok=4T4jDaU_iUWrubyM6Oe35Q&ds=sh&pq=lysine&cp=9&gs_id=c&xhr=t&q=lysine+cream&pf=p&es_sm=91&sclient=psy-ab&oq=lysine+cr&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.67720277,d.cGU&biw=1280&bih=658&tch=1&ech=4&psi=8ZeAU_uiMIHZoAShmILACg.1400936435674.3&sa=X&ei=C5iAU9DCBMaFogTp4YDYAw&sqi=2&ved=0CGYQ8wIwAA), but there are other types out there.   
2. Ice cubes  

The instant i feel the tickl-y numb feeling anywhere on my lips i put lysine cream on. This typically keeps it from breaking out. If it actually gets going, then get an ice cube on it asap. You may want to protect your hands with a wash cloth, but i put the ice cube directly on the sore for several minutes several times per day. This seems to cut itch and duration of sore.  

Sometimes I also use abreva - but the two above typically keep me from needing it.  

Also in case no one told you hsv1 can, in some cases, be passed to genitals, especially for those who were not exposed to hsv1 as children - [non-scholarly reference](http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/once-enough-herpes-simplex-virus-1-hsv1)
