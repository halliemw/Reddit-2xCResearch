l think you did the right thing: 1) minding your own business 2) taking the high road and not purposefully fueling conflict and 3) Tina just needs to realize the world does what it does and she just needs to roll with it without expecting allies and accommodations for every little unpleasant situation. Her expectations for others are unreasonable.

Nobody gets to force others to feel a certain way. They don't get to tell you who you can befriend or when you get to party with friends. 

Handling things "like a guy would" makes no sense to me. What does that even mean? Can you describe this? Sounds like you handled the situations like a reasonable adult. Is that what guys do? Is the expectation that you need to dumb it down for your female friends? Exclude others and be petty? What exactly are the female and male ways to deal with friends? I don't even know where to begin.
