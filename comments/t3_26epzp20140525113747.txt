Because conceding the name to be 'lost' or 'not worth holding on to' allows for the false narrative of an invented strawman feminism to become even more normalized than it already has.

It is not feminism's fault that a lot of people don't understand what feminism is. The people who either invented, exaggerated or perceived incorrectly so apparent 'negative connotations associated with feminism' don't get to own the word, it's history or the achievements of the ideology.

You used the phrase 'reasonable feminists', which implies to me that you feel a lot of feminists are 'unreasonable'. I don't think this is at all true. I think, if you believe this, you have bought into the ignorance of misogynists. (don't worry, I did for a while too.)

I don't see value in giving in to the uneducated. I believe in educating them. People can change. I changed. Feminist change will come, as it has been coming since the first women began fighting for equality.
