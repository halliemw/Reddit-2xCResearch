They are definitely available in the mens at airports and sports arenas in CA.  

"The first measure, Senate Bill 1358, would require public facilities — including movie theaters, sports arenas, libraries, and restaurants — to make sure there are changing stations “accessible to both men and women.” Senate Bill 1350 doesn’t require public buildings to go back and add changing stations to existing bathrooms, but specifies that changing tables should be “equally available or provided regardless of the gender for which the restroom facilities are designed” if they’re being added in the future."

California Wants To Put Baby Changing Tables In ~~Men’s~~ Restrooms.

Seems reasonable to me.
