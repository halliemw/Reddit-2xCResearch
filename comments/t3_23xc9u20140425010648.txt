Congrats on the weight loss!  That's amazing.  

I had a similar issue with my ex's family.  I didn't lose weight, but was much thinner than they were when we got married.  Unfortunately, I didn't stick to my guns about not eating dessert and taking seconds when pushed on me (they were really insistent!  I grew up in a house where it would have been rude to decline after so much urging.  Although one where so much urging wouldn't have occurred.).  

Anyway, I ended up gaining quite a bit of weight when we lived by them, then losing it when we moved away.  It doesn't sound like you're going to let it change your diet and your new-found healthiness.  But just in case you were tempted... it doesn't work out well. :)

I do agree that perhaps you can just have a small portion of whatever dessert is offered.  I'm not typically that good with small portions so it didn't work for me, but if it works for you, it's probably less offensive than outright refusal.
