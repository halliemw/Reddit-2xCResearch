Was her arthritis hereditary or as a result of the birth control? My concern is that the Mirena somehow triggered arthritis. I don't know if it's entirely possible but I've Googled (even though I know that's the WORST THING) and found stories of people who were diagnosed with arthritis after getting their IUD.
