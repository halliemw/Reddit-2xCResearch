I did not know that.  TIL! :)

But I'm so old that when I first started menstruating, all there was was a cardboard applicator.  I honestly don't get the big deal between that and the plastic ones that are "pearly and soft" or whatever.  You're still sticking something up your vagina that's either bone dry or all lubed up with blood.  Either way it's slightly uncomfortable, messy, some combination of both, and really I just don't care as much about that at all, so much as I care about protecting my cute little panties.  Those things cost good money!
