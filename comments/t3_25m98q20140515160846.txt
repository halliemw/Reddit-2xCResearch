I have a couple skin tags too :/ one in the same place as OP, one in my butthole (only reason I prefer not doing anal), and one in my mouth! The last one was there when I was born, but it was the same size as my lip . They would have operated if it had grown with me. 

Sorry for saying so much, I just don't see stuff about skin tags often and I feel like a freak about them usually.
