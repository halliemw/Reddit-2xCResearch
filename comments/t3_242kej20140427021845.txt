Dude you should totally start volunteering somewhere. Plant some trees take care of baby animals or teach a skill . Not only will you meet people gain skills kill time or bring happiness but you will feel good about yourself and you can go to bed with the knowledge that you made this world in some way less shitty. I personally have gotten a job through a volunteer gig and figured out what I want to be when I grow up at the age of twenty eight when I started working with wildlife. I believe that we all gotta pay our rent for living on this planet .
