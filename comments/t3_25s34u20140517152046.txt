Thank you.

I've never considered pressing charges because I know it wouldn't go anywhere. The only evidence I have is the doctors notes in my file about the bruising/tearing/trauma since I showered multiple times and didn't leave my house for several days. I had also been drinking that night (only two drinks) but I was underage at the time and I know I would get blamed for it. We were very close friends and he is a respected "nice guy" in the town.
