There are many reasons not to get into a gypsy cab. They're not licensed. They're not insured. Most of all, they're potentially unsafe --both because the car isn't inspected as rigorously, and because the driver hasn't passed the same security checks. I would never let a female friend or family member get into a random, unsolicited gypsy cab.
