Whats yours? People have sex to excess, and often without condoms. Do people drink water to excess for pleasure or fun? People who sleep around are more likely to get a STI, HIV or something else serious like Hepatitis C. Things that kill people, that you may not even know you have when you continue that behavior. 

But thanks for contributing with an example that is absolutely ridiculous and not at all related though!
