He sees other men as inferior based on other characteristics he doesn't like (to do with race, and financial status).  His disdain for men appears to stem from his sense of entitlement to womans affections and subsequent hatred of them for not giving him what he wants.

Other men merely get in the way, particularly 'ugly XYZ race men' who don't really deserve to be with someone who is of higher status in his mind (white, attractive, blonde).

His primary target of hate is women because 'they control which men get sex and which men don't' - his whole attitude is about the fact that he is not getting what he deserves and is entitled to - which is relationships and sex from white women.

He does almost contradict his own views at times, writing 141 pages of vitriol will do that to you, I guess.  

This sentiment isn't new.  How many of these school-shooters have been white males (Rodgers is half-white, but appears to only identify with that race) with a sense of righteous retaliation?  Targeting people, in particular, women/girls who they feel have rejected them or haven't given them the affections/attentions they desire.

Turns out, it's the majority of these cases.
