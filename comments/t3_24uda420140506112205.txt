So, you are basically saying that everyone is totally and completely powerless against the manipulators and abusers, until they specifically learn about it? 

I do admit that just stating 'low self esteem' is simplifying things, as there are many other things involved. Normalisation of abuse (as quite often people repeat abusive relationships of their parents) is part of it. The feeling that somehow you have to 'deserve' love and respect. The feeling that 'things just are this way, and it could be worse'. 

It still are just different words for - putting someone above yourself, therefore assigning a higher value to the other person instead of yourself. Just other words for self-esteem or self-worth.

It still is not victim-blaming, as you can't blame someone for things that they don't know about themselves. 

And I have not seen a person who started with healthy self-worth/self-esteem and ended up with an abuser.
