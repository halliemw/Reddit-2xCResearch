While this is bluntly put, it is true. There is no reason to take this crap personally, the people saying these things know nothing about the person they're trashing and don't give a shit. Their insults are directed at all who will listen to them, not tailored to any one person. It really isn't personal, so try to remember that when someone is a dick to you on the internet. How can it be personal if an internet stranger doesn't know the first bit about you? They're just being dicks.
