You would think. I've done this before and she makes a big deal out of it. She thinks I'm telling her to not say things and censoring her. She'll say "What, you can say anything you want to me and I can't even talk to you?" ...Then she'll cry about how she's not even allowed to talk, and everyone tries to shut her up and how she's not allowed opinions.
  
It's funny that I already know how she'll (over)react to every situation. She'll turn every situation around. I've never heard her apologize for anything before, except once, when she gave a half-assed "sorry, but..."
  
Okay, I'm done ranting... For now.
