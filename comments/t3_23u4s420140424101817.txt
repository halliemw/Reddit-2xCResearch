If you went to college, your school might offer career services for alumni that could help you. A lot of college career offices will do mock interviews so that you can practice and get feedback, which will help you work out some of these issues in a setting where the stakes are low. I imagine in a big city like Chicago there are probably also programs through other organizations if the college career office isn't an option. Based on a quick Google searuch, looks like [Career Transitions Center of Chicago](http://www.ctcchicago.org/PDP1.asp?MPid=10) offers services that might help you. It's not free, but if it will help you finally get the better job you need maybe it would be worth it?
