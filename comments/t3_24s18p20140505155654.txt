No, they're not attacking the choice to be pure. What they're attacking is 1. A father owning his daughters sexuality. 2. A girls value lying in her virginity. It is discussed as a gift, as if it is a physical object. If you aren't pure, you are impure. Basing ones worth on her abstinence is what feminists and others who think women are people don't like. 

Have you noticed there's not a boys purity ball for sons and mothers?
