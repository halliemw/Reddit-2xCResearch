I also have a boyfriend with OCD, though with different obsessions and compulsions, but I sympathise with you. It is very hard to feel secondary to odd rituals and compulsions that seem to dominate romantic moments, and your relationship in general. One thing I will say, though, is that resisting compulsions is the ONLY way things will ever change. My bf's counsellor advised him to wait and resist the compulsive feelings and thoughts until they pass (because they always do) - this shows the person that really their fears are not valid because they can survive without following them through.

Though you might feel like accommodating your boyfriend's OCD is the right thing to do because it is an anxiety disorder and therefore hard for him, in reality you will only perpetuate it. It reinforces that they are real and important concerns. As the other comments have said though, you can only do so much yourself - the rest has to come from him. The real crux of the issue is whether he is happy the way he is, or if he wants to get better. If it is the former, you have some thinking to do. If it is the latter, then learn everything you can about OCD and how to get help.
