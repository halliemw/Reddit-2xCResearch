In the end, she will make her own choice. But your consistency as a friend through every moment will be ultimately important. It is obvious that the relationship is unhealthy, but no one in an abusive relationship can see it for what it is while they are in it. The advice here is great. Stay as close as she will let you, try to remain patient with her, and find ways that you two can spend time together away from the situation. Give her space to live, and in the end, hopefully she will choose life. It is really hard to walk away from an abusive relationship, but if she does, then recommend that she block his number for a while, so he can't harass her. Good luck, stay strong, she needs you, even when she doesn't want you there.
