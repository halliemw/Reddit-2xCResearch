Absolutely, but the article doesn't say whether this was done by someone working for the team, or by an attendee.  It's wrong either way, but if it wasn't done by anyone who would be a Defendant in this case, then I'm not sure if it's relevant to the court case (beyond confirming that it's a really shitty job, which I don't think was ever in dispute).
