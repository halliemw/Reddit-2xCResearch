I dunno. The amount of men who would stab a woman to death for not accepting a prom invitation is clearly a statistical anomaly. Normal, sane, rational people do not do this. Male entitlement is certainly an issue that should be addressed but this was a horrible, crazy person, and the masses definitely do not support him in any way. I'm pretty sure Sanchez's friend actually took to Tumblr to tell these people to stop using her dead friend as a martyr for the feminist movement.
