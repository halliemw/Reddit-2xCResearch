Kind of lame of OP? Excise me? Her so called friend showed blatant disrespect for her by breaking her rules, and OP did the right thing by being honest with her parents. It's their house and their rules, she is definitely not making too big of a deal out of it. Her friend is entirely to blame, and you should be ashamed of yourself for blaming OP.
