I totally get where you're coming from. 

I got my first job at 14 and haven't asked for money since (I'm 20). My mom paid for occasionally copays at doctors offices, but aside from that my day to day expenses I paid for. 

Since I grew up with money being a constant struggle, and me being independent very young, moving in with my boyfriend was a very odd concept. Something I struggled with constantly.

Before I moved I made sure I had more than enough money as a safety net. Meaning, I had enough money in my checking account to pay for a hotel for a week, a cab to the airport, and a flight ticket home. That really gave me peace of mind. Knowing that if the worst possible thing ever happened, I would still get by on my own. I strongly recommend you develop this "worst case scenario" option. 

On a day to day basis, I just had to get used to it. I don't mean I'm not grateful everyday that I'm taken care of, but spending another persons money is not something I ever did, so it's was very weird at first. 

Before moving in I recommend you develop a system of how you will access money. Will he give you a credit card with your name on it, cash, a joint debit card? The first few weeks were very awkward as I felt like a kid asking his mom for an allowance to buy groceries.  It really is what you feel most comfortable with, you don't want to feel trapped and without resources. We have chosen cash and credit card. Every few weeks he'll draw up a lump some of cash (we live abroad so it's usually when the exchange rate is good) and leaves it for me. I also have a credit card which would only really be used for emergencies. 

Just remember it's short term. As long as you are actively looking for a job there is nothing to feel guilty about! I imagine given the reversed you would have no qualms doing the same for him. 

Just talk about any concerns you have before hand. 

-does he want you to pay him back when you get a job?
-are there any extra responsibilities you should take on as the nonworker?
-are you both comfortable with the arrangement?
-when you do get a job, how will you be splitting costs? 
-this is temporary. Even if he is the breadwinner he can't hold it against you, or try to stifle you because of it.
