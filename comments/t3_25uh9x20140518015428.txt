Not sure whether to tell you congratulations or commiserations, so feel free to sub in the appropriate option! 

Firstly, don't feel afraid to try out different brands of pads and tampons. You don't have to restrict yourself to what's available in your house. Even if you don't like the feel of pads, you can keep them in case your flow gets too heavy for tampons. 

Also, buy some painkillers with Naproxen - they're good for cramps. Hot compresses also work well (some people even have good results with cold compresses - try different things to see what works for you). Wear your darker, less wanted underwear this week - you *will* have a leak at some point.
