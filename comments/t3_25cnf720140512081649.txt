Partially the first. I find a foundation of truth and a lot of "fake it until you make it" can really help build self esteem. 

Years and years ago after a bad break up I had a stretch of "No one will ever love me, I'm awful and have nothing going for me".

I started to get out of it by thinking and focusing first on the things I WAS good at or that I liked about myself. Find something you like about yourself (you're funny, caring, have good eyelashes, are really good at painting your nails) and start from there. 

After you start to focus on things you like about yourself and get into a better head space it's easier to bring other things up to. "You know what, I _am_ funny! And I'm pretty good looking too!"
