God, I can't even imagine; it's got to be daunting. It takes a very definite sort of courage to face the kind of unpleasantness some people may be inclined to throw your way; I certainly hope you're fortunate enough not to encounter anything you can't face with your head up and shrug off later on, at the least. I've got my fingers crossed for you as you continue your transition, and I hope that as time goes by, you're able to start feeling more at home in your skin and less sensitive when ignorant people flash you a rude eye.
