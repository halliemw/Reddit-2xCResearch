Most people are prone to emotional attachment if you're having regular sex.

If your partners hiding their feelings & hoping you'll change your clearly stated opinion, it's not your responsibility to control their behavior if you're being consistently upfront about it.  They can't control their feelings, and neither can you, but they're responsible for listening to your stated intentions and deciding whether they can handle those despite their developing feelings.

Maybe try to find partners in the swinger or poly communities? Partners who already have other relationships aren't guaranteed to not develop feelings for you, but they'll likely have more experience honoring boundaries around how to handle those feelings without expecting an involved romantic relationship.
