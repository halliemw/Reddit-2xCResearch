Unfortunately, she did not take me with her to the police department. She regrets not doing so. From what she has told me of what happened there, it sounds like she may have been in shock enough to have not been able to be as confident in her answers as the officer may have hoped. And based on how she was even speaking to me then, I think it's reasonable to assume that the officer may have been a little skeptical due to the fact that she was saying things like "I think" and making generalizations. However, the fact that the cop made a comment about the semen belonging to someone who she had willingly had sex with over a week ago? What purpose did that serve? That is a red flag to me. In addition, she was told that the rape kit would be taken into consideration. She got the police report less than 24 hours later, which stated that "no foul play was identified". The doctor stated out loud that there was obviously "forcible entry" and "obvious trauma" during her exam for the rape kit. Am I missing something? Shouldn't something else have happened if the rape kit contradicted the police report?
