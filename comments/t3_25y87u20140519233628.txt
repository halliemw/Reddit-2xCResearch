I can relate! Don't feel alone, I used to work in a place with 3 other women and although I was the same age as 2 of them, the 3 others got a long famously. Texted each other, hung out, drank together, posting selfies. I had never felt more left out. It was clear that I was an outcast. Even in my closest group of friends I feel like an outcast. 

I've realized that I get along best with a certain kind of person. Accepting people, less judgemental people. The girls at my work were selective with who they interactive with, the popular people. Maybe I am a bit too quirky for those kinds of people, but their are definitely others who embrace anyone who is kind in return. 

Don't feel boring. Just because they don't click with you doesn't mean there aren't others who will. They might not exist within your work place, but they are out there. Even shy people can relate to other shy people. I often try to find those shy people, because they tend to be the least judgemental and accepting. 

I've often looked at other people and saw how easily they make friends. In highschool, there were students who could make an inside joke with any teacher and make friends in any social group. I always wondered why I wasn't like that. It helps when you see other people around you who are in the same boat.
