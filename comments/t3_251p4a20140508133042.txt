As a victim of assault, actually go fuck yourself.

I didn't get drunk. I didn't go out late. I didn't wear short skirts, I didn't go out alone, I didn't forget to leave my name and number with a friend in case I didn't make it home because I DIDN'T EVEN LEAVE MY HOME. I wasn't around strangers, I wasn't friends with unfavorables, I FOLLOWED THE RULES and it still happened.

He was my friend. He was someone I knew for years. He was someone I trusted. He was the son of a police officer.

Your post is -incredibly- antagonistic. What, should I not have friends? Maybe I should just not have a home, since most sexual assaults happen within them. Oh, if only oonts didn't have friends. If only oonts was a fucking RECLUSE in a MOUNTAIN this all could have been avoided.

Hiding your shit blaming behind "dissenting opinions" is cowardly. It is callous. Most importantly, **IT IS WRONG**.
