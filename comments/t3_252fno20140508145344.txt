This exactly. Ideas do not have a gender or sex. It shouldn't matter what types of genitals or brain mapping a person has when presenting an idea. Women are not a monolithic block. We hold various opinions of issues which would get us booed on this subreddit because we do not conform to this subreddit's definition of what a woman is. What is worse is that this flair can be used to silence center left, moderate, conservative women by giving them a scarlet letter of sorts. I myself am center left and I am tired of the extremist left claiming that they speak for all women.
