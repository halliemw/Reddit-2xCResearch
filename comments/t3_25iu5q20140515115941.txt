Due to the unbelievably condescending way that was written and the fact that the girl kicked out left with several of her friends, which would account for the others kicked out, I doubt the source of that blog is on the level.  The girl kicked out has a legitimate axe to grind.  Another high school girl trying to scold her has no dog in the fight and sounds like spin control.
