It's an investigation about whether or not it is now acceptable to talk about women in a sexual, violent manner, and if there is a new edge to misogyny thanks to the internet. Meetings with journalists who have been on both sides (misogyny directed against them, and others who think it's just an internet thing and women need to 'man up'). It also discusses sexist humour and discusses an interesting study which shows that sexist humour allows sexist men to behave in sexist ways without feeling it is wrong.

It's difficult to summarise it as it's mostly a discussion around it and doesn't come to any conclusions per se, but it brings up a lot of good points about the role of media, the difference between the way people feel about the examples given in the show and whether or not we are moving into a new type of aggressive misogyny or if the internet has just meant we're exposed to it more.

I am super bad at explaining/summarising stuff, I'm sorry!
