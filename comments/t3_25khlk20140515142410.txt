I used to be that way (strong enough to move most things).  Then, a repetitive motion syndrome set in (in my spine).  That made my spine more vulnerable to fractures.  Then anemia further weakened my bones, and then...estrogen fluctuated and my bones got a bit more brittle.  I ended up snapping one of the little connectors in my spine by lifting something.  I am really sorry I did that, because I'm in constant pain now.  

But, when I was young, I tackled everything - for me, it's getting older that's hard to accept.  My strength is definitely way less than it was (obviously, now with the spine injury - which I made worse by refusing to stop lifting/doing certain things), and men my age have no such problems.

So enjoy being able to lift - and don't be a dummy like me and lift something wrongly or that it is too heavy!
