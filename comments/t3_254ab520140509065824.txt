I love my pill, you can claw it out of my cold dead hands.  I had terrible periods, cramping, pain, my second day I literally was incapable of working due to constant dizziness from the sheer amount of blood, etc leaving my body.  (TMI but on my second day I used wear a super plus tampon and a heavy duty pad and had to change both every hour).

I went on the pill after I met my bf and the difference.  I am now regular, almost to the hour.  I have a very light flow and it lasts 4 days max.  

All people are different, it would be best to go speak to a dr.
