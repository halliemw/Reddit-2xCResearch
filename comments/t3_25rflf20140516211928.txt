Maybe he's not being nice/helpful. Maybe he's not commenting on the clothes. He may not realize he's doing it, but he may be seeing someone attractive, feeling attracted to that person/model, and feels that since he only "should" be attracted to you, he's not really attracted to them but is just thinking how hot you'd look in those clothes. That might be a bit convoluted, but at the very least, the fact that he keeps saying "hot" and the inclusion of thigh high socks says sexual to me. It might be a slight clothing kink (maybe he wants to dress you up and take you out? Could be fun). Talk to him about it before you write him off as rude (because if he is "just trying to be nice/helpful" he's being a rude ass and needs to stop yesterday).
