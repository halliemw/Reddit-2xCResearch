Confidence is key. I have been dealing with the same issues since I was around that age, so about ten years now. I walk outside every day and live in a place that gets super hot weather for half the year, so unless I want to experience heat exhaustion every day I have to wear shorts and tank tops when I walk to work. Needless to say I get a lot of street harassment, though most often it's just a lot of creepy, unwanted attention. It never stops... BUT I know that if something happens, I can defend myself, or I can call for help. In a world where women have no choice but to deal with this, it's all we can do until people (specifically these men) learn to not be creepy.

BUT, if something does happen to her and for some reason she can't defend herself, or help doesn't come, or anything like that.. remind her it is NOT her fault. It is not her fault if anyone assaults her or acts creepy towards her. never ever her fault - it is the assaulter's fault because they are the ones being assholes.
