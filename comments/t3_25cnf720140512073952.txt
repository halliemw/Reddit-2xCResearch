Not everyone is beautiful. Sorry to say it. But not everyone is smart either, and not everyone can play the guitar. You are so much more than your looks, and it's not your job to be eyecandy

Obvisouly if you're totally hideous people will treat you differently, just like being really really good looking might give you some benefits. But i dare to say, no one is born ugly. If you take care of yourself, it will show!
