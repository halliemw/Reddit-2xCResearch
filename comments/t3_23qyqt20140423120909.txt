I would really recommend looking into some form of therapy, one that perhaps deals with ptsd, as you are having symptoms that align themselves with that disorder. CBT is a highly effective treatment you can request, try googling it, I have been using it and it's a great method. I do suggest trying to find the closest help to you, if you can not get access to a therapist, or counselor, see if there are public mental health buildings or services in your community. 

If you try CBT, it is there to get you re-acclimated to situations that you typically would not panic at. It sounds like you are very frustrated with your situation and understandably so. 

Trust me, when you've been dealing with something as horribly traumatizing as this, you need a helping hand to get you to where you want to be. Try to remember that EVERYONE needs to get assistance at one time or another, and it sounds like you would really benefit from outside help. 

I really recommend looking for therapy from wherever you think you can get it!
