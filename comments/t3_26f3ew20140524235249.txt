If you are in a position to get a job in customer service, like being a part-time cashier or a bartender, you should definitely consider it! 

In jobs like that you are forced to make small talk with everyone who comes through, and you quickly learn to read people and to socialize better. 

I had trouble for a long time, but working with people everyday has really helped me gain confidence and feel more comfortable talking with others.
