No, I don't believe in "emotional cheating" in that sense. I believe a relationship is a daily choice that both parties make according to their own verbalized and acknowledged boundaries and requirements. We all get different things from different friendships. You don't get to dictate who he enjoys spending time with if you both continue forward within the bounds of your agreed upon terms. 

Your insecurity may be a sign of weak communication between the two of you. Talk to him more. Make a point to spend more time together alone. Make sure you're getting all of your requirements met and he's getting his. Don't lash out or accuse.

Even if he has a bit of a crush, that's no reflection on you AT ALL. As long as he's respectful to you and honors his commitment, crushes come and go; it's who we choose to be with every day, that we want to go through the best and worst of life with, that really matters.
