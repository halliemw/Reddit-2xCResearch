I've been fortunate to not have experienced either. Maybe some slight sexism or sexist comments but nothing that sticks out in my mind or even that I remembered a day later. 

As for random cat call type situations, the worst of it being guys in the car next to me looking at me as I'm driving down the highway or something and speeding up/slowing down to look at me a few more times or hitting on me by complimenting me (and I haven't even had a situation where it was vulgar/inappropriate "compliments" either). But nothing more than that. *knock on wood*
