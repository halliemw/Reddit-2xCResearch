Yeah whatever some of us get hatemail all the time for being outspoken, there are so many bad comments I guess we'll stop reporting them and eventually it'll end up like /r/funny

Sooooooo easy to understand what is happening, I'm sorry that I fell for it and was trying to be "fair" about the going default.

The thing is, reddit gets plain toxic, and it finds pedophiles somehow not as bad as SJWs.  I'd like to see anything that proves someone other than OP here was running a "false flag".

The only thing I found were sock puppet accounts that supported the move to default. And since I've been instructed that linking to things like this might also be "feeding trolls"  (trolls similar to the kind one of the mods here seemed associated with at one point although the jury is out on that) you can find them on your own.
