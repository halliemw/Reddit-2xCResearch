Conditioner, and make sure your hair isn't dry. With curly hair, you shouldn't brush it too much, just detangle it in the shower with conditioner. Since it's curly, it'll soak up oil, so find a basic oil you like, distribute a drop over your hands (just enough to make them shiny), and scrunch it in your hair. Add more if you feel like your hair is still dry.
