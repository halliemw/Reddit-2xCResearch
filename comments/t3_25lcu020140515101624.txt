Hey, no prob! If you've got a few bike shops in your area, check out online reviews first. Some shops are better than others when it comes to servicing all their customers -- not just the people who are really into it and want to drop a couple grand on carbon. If you're not getting good service, feel free to walk right on outta there. For the most part though, people who work in bike shops tend to be like me, in that they love biking so much they want everybody to ride!
