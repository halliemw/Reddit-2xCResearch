From head to toe you look at a woman, she may seem androgynous. Her general shape can be apple-like, higher upper fat deposits, thinning hair. Her face might have more hair than usual, sideburns coming lower almost to her jaw or past it, light moustache, darker eyebrows, distinctly darker coarser hair than the rest. Her arms and legs might have long, dark, coarse hairs, sometimes going all the way to her knuckles. Around her neck, arm pits and other joint areas might have a velvety skin, often with skin tags that can darken. From near invisible to dark black, no amount of scrubbing will make it disappear. The overall muscle tone is much larger than other women. PCOS women may have issues with their weight but under the fat deposit is a real strength of muscle.
