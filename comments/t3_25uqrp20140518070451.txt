Oh, okay.

Maybe people don't believe it's real because some girl calling up her mom's boyfriend's lover to confront her in the wee hours of the morning sounds fake. And if it's not, even in the heat of the moment, it's an incredibly immature thing to do.

If you're looking for help and advice, I would say take a step back and focus on yourself. I know you thought of this dude as your dad, but ultimately it's up to your mother and Bryan to sort stuff out between them. Getting involved in their love life/breakup/whatever is not only not your place, but it will cause you undue stress. Being supportive of your mother in a difficult time, and meddling are two completely different things. I have been in a similar situation (found my married dad's online dating profile), and my biggest regret is getting too involved in the whole debacle. 

If you are struggling for a place to live, I would recommend a women's shelter for you and your mom. They exist for these exact kind of situations. You'll probably be able to get better help and advice from the people there, who are trained for these types of situations, than a bunch of random strangers on the internet. Good luck.
