There is a very very small chance that you could get pregnant, especially with how precise you are, but that chance is still there. My cousin had her daughter while she was on the pill. 

But even with knowing a family member who had a child while on the pill, I still think the chance is slim enough that I'd personally take the risk. I've done so in the past, until I got implanon a few months ago.
