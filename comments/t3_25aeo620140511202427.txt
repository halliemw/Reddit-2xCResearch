Implied in every residential lease hold is what's called the implied warrantee of quiet enjoyment.  Basically, if the landlord or someone under his/her control, by their actions or inactions, is in someway detracting from your quiet enjoyment of the property, you can go to you LL and complain.  The men in the elevator are also leaseholders, they are considered to by under the LL's control.  If you complain and the behavior continues, you can move out and not be held to the lease.  I don't think it's fair that you and your husband would have to move, but you can then sue for monetary damages, punitive if the LL is told repeatedly and does nothing.  

You should talk to your LL as well as other neighbors, for a couple of reasons.  First, you want to document that you spoke to the LL.  This will be crucial evidence in a civil suit later.  Second, you want to give your neighbors a heads up that this is what you've experienced.  You may not be the only female who's had to endure this type of harassment.  Lastly, your actions, if you chose this route, put these men on notice that they're being watched and that this type of behavior is unacceptable.  

Not sure what state you live in and the tenancy laws vary from state to state, but if you talk to your LL a few times and nothing is done about this, move out and call an attorney.  Document any other behavior by these guys.  Tell your husband to leave them alone.  Be well and I hope things work out.
