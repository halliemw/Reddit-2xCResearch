Yep back out out asap because otherwise resentment will just build and build and you'll end up losing the friendship. 

I was supposed to be maid of honour for a friend last year but she was expecting so much from me, ($250 for a hotel room the night of the wedding when I live a $20 cab ride away, for me to take out the facial piercings I've had for 10+ years, to grow out and dye my hair etc etc) The final straw came when I went overseas for a week in early September more than 2 months before the wedding. She said "I cried for four hours when you flew to LA. It made me feel like you'll always put yourself ahead of me"

Weddings make people crazy, if you feel like the bride is being unreasonable now RUN AWAY it will only get worse!
