I'm a man but I have gigantic thighs and have this problem. I usually try to shower quickly whenever I get really sweaty since sweat irritates but skin, but in general I try to wear longer tight fitting underwear. Men's underwear might be useful for you since boxer briefs can extend to the mod thigh.
