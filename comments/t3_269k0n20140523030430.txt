You're right, I took the article's implication that her history contributed to her suicide as a claim that her family believed it was related, and I was mistaken.  Sorry about that.

And, yes, I totally mean to say that depression is a straight path to suicide. I have never known depression and care nothing for people who experience it. /s

I'm not justifying piss poor behavior at all, I'm saying that you can avoid people harassing you online by deleting your accounts and ignoring them.  If people are harassing you to the extent of provoking suicide in real life, it is entirely possible they are doing so criminally.  Please tell me how you propose to prevent online bullying by punishing individual insults.

I don't expect US law enforcement to prosecute trolls from abroad, because it is impossible.  You are advocating either something impossible to enforce and morally execute, or flat out prior censorship based on each individual claim of "harassment."
