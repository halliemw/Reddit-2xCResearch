One of your bosses didn't like you, plain and simple. If they wanted you around, they would have created another job for you, or ask if you would take a pay cut. At the end of the day, this is business. Also, I don't know why you let them take advantage of you, because it sounds like you're complaining about all those extra hours you worked.
