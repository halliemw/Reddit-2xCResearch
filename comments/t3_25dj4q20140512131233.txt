THANK YOU.  A lot of my friends are very liberal and are into experimenting with both genders which is beautiful and I get it but this is not the same scenario at all.  It's not until I put it into the perspective of a female friend acting the same way in which they kind of get it.  They really don't see how unsupportive of equality they are being and it's infuriating.
