Considering reddits user base is 1/3 women and this subreddit caters to women i think you are wrong in regards to men "taking over" this sub.   
Most will take a look, maybe comment on a discussion or two concerning men and then stop reading. Because a lot of the topics discussed here just doesn't interest the average male redditor.  
I'm sorry you get harassing PM's, but the ones doing that won't be able to take over your sub.
     
Sist men ikke minst, Norge er best.
