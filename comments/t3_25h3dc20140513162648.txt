I'm 31 and haven't had this happen yet, but, from what I understand, that is normal. Many women start having more sporadic periods as they age, sometimes going months between periods. This doesn't mean you are in menopause, but it might mean your estrogen levels are starting to drop... sort of like a pre-pre-menopause.

The last period usually doesn't happen until about age 50, but women typically stop being able to naturally conceive around 40. Beginning in your late 30s, I believe it's normal to skip periods and not ovulate every month. Definitely mention it to your OB, though, just to see if there's anything that needs to be monitored.
