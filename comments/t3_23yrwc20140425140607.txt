First, keep in mind things can get better. Looking back on my college days, I was way more stressed than I am now, and probably more so than I needed to be simply due to being a pessimist and a worrier. My life changed dramatically a few months after graduation after I finally ended up getting a good job and moving away from my hometown. Things have gotten increasingly more stable since I've become financially independent.

Does your school offer any counseling services or do you have insurance to seek out a therapist to talk to? Even if there's nothing "wrong" with you and you're just dealing with a lot in life, it's good to have someone to talk to.

Reach out to your department head or graduation counselor. They might be able to help you lighten your class load or take a few more manageable classes next semester without compromising your graduation date or major.

You can also talk to your school's employment center--they are pretty good at helping with resumes and interview skills (there are lots of subtle things to both that even very smart, educated people aren't aware of.

Do you have to have a good job immediately after graduation? Or do you have family or friends who could help you out for a while or could you get by with a lower-paying job until you get where you want to be?

Try to focus on the good things in your life, even when things feel overwhelming. 21 can be a really tough place to be if you're studying something challenging and working and dealing with life without being financially independent.

Keep exercising regularly, even if it's only an hour long walk or a 10 minute jog.
