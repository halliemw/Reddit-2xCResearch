Lots of good advice! Here's some life changing additions/affirmations, from someone who also waited until marriage -

 - affirming the communication! advice. Go slow and talk about expectations up front. Both of your main desires aught to be pleasing your partner (yes, I said it). When you BOTH have this loving attitude, sex can be such an incredible, relationship-affirming thing!

 - the above doesn't mean that you don't get YOUR needs met as well, though. Be gently verbal in what is "working" and what isn't, and realize that a session of great sex WILL mean that both of you may perform things for your partner that may not be your favorite, but drives your partner insane :) Just make sure to keep communicating so the "give and take" is equal.

 - probably the ONE thing that has contributed to our sex life the most for 25 years - **find a way to suggest that he make it the norm to let YOU finish first!** Remember - you can keep going after orgasm much easier than he can. So - After all the foreplay, after all the stroking and playing and petting and what-have-you... when it's time to "get down to business", "head to the finish line", or whatever you want to call it, my husband ALWAYS lets me finish first, then he finishes soon after. Oh, sometimes it's simultaneous, sometimes he finishes first by accident, or sometimes I feel I may not be able to finish and tell him to go ahead, but 80% of the time I finish first. My "finishing" position is almost always him on his back, me sitting on top. I can control the rate, the angles, the stimulation, etc. After hours of pre-sex and "fun" sex (trying new things, taking our time, oral, etc.), I can jump on top and finish in about 60 seconds, if I want to, lol!. Then I just ask seductively, "how do YOU, want to finish, big guy!", and he knows he can request whatever - his favorites, something we tried earlier that he liked, etc. And, he can concentrate guilt-free on his own mind-blowing orgasm. And, I get to participate and throw myself "all-in", because I've just had my own head-exploding climax and can focus on him.

I'm telling you, our sex life after 25 years is still awesome, and I get teenager-level excited every night we plan for an evening of lovemaking (which is once or twice a week, at least).

I've shared this tip with many girlfriends who were struggling in the married sex health situation, and many times it's been a game changer.

Maybe let him read some of these posts here, so HE can feel confidently prepared as well??
