I don't think the design of this study really speaks to scenarios where this is discrimination based on gender, race, etc. There are other studies that show implicit biases exist, but that is because of socialization, not necessary in-group bias. That why I never enjoyed doing research in social psych; the discussions are often ahistorical and lack external validity.
