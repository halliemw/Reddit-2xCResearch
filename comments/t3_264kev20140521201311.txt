>In my opinion if you want to have a dress code you should have a uniform. It means that teachers have concrete things to mention of your clothes are inappropriate. When the dress code in my school was broken it was never because someone was wearing something "too sexy"

But in the real work place, there is no uniform, yet you still have a dress code. And whats appropriate will depend on your body.
