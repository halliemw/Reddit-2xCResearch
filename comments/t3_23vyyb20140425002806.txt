And they should.

She either didn't file a police report, lost her legal case against him, or chose to not go through a criminal case. He's legally innocent, and while the school found him guilty and punished him as they saw fit.  You can squabble about the schools punishment of him all you want.    

However, I don't know what the victim honestly expected to happen.  The school can't renig on their punishment of the rapist.

It sucks, but no one is forcing her to transfer or take two years off.  She's choosing to make that call.

I think victims like this tend to do more damage than good.  There are good and bad ways to use your experience as a rape victim.  In this young woman's case, lobbying for better handling of rape cases on campus going forward would be way more productive than just complaining about how he's welcome back on campus and trying to overturn his suspension for an expulsion.
