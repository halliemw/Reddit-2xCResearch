Thank you! That above comment made me rage a bit. Not going to lie. The way she/he said it is EXACTLY how my ex husband see's it, and I cannot for the life of me, wrap my head around why people can be so delusional about responsibility. If this person is a troll, he/she is VERY good. If not, he/she sounds like the sort of person who adopts puppies and returns them to the shelter 2 months later.
