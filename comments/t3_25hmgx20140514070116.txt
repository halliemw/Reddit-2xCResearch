If these are the 'worst' things he has said id just ignore it. I mean from what you posted here, he hasn't said anything truly derogatory or offensive. You should already have your hands full working towards your PhD, why don't you just not take everything so personally and focus at the task at hand. Btw older people tend to be less PC than younger generations nowadays. Sure, 30 years ago he could say that and no one would care but in todays overly PC world its apparently harassment. Just keep in mind since hes older hes prob not gunna change the way he speaks so either get used to it or drop the class. Sorry if i seem stern but to me its only an issue if hes directly saying to you something like "Oh well your a woman i wouldn't expect you to know that..." etc etc
