Last Wednesday I was rushed into an emergency c-section at 35 weeks because my daughter's heart rate dropped crazy low while I was having a routine test done. 

In one week she's been taken off cpap (to help her breathe) and has been started on breast milk. She's still on IV to balance out the no food but things are looking up. 

I got to hold her for the first time last night.  My week has been full of win.
