This is interesting.  I took that comment to mean that she did (and does?) those things, but her anger was directed at the fact that stuff like that is portrayed often and is acceptable in the media and society, but real life doesn't stop there, it includes the unpleasant or unappealing stuff too.  I reread the article with your interpretation in mind, but I'm still not sure which one she meant.
