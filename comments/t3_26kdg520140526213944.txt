I figured that might happen. Good news: you were right about your cup size, as a 32DD holds the same volume as a 28F. You just need a tighter band that will offer support and won't ride up. You can actually find a lot of affordable bras in your size on [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=node%3D1044960&field-keywords=28F&rh=n%3A1036592%2Cn%3A!1036682%2Cn%3A1040660%2Cn%3A14333511%2Cn%3A1044960%2Ck%3A28F) (you just have to check US vs UK sizes to be sure the cup is correct). You could also try looking for advice on /r/ABraThatFits (28F is a pretty common size; someone might have an old one they'd be willing to mail to you) or browse /r/braswap for bras in your size. 

I know this stuff can be frustrating—we've all been teenage girls and have had to deal with our growing bodies, and I can assure you that the growth you're going through is completely normal. It was really hard for me when I first started needing bras (my mom would only let me buy sports bras because she didn't like underwires). It's hard to get things you need for yourself when you don't have an allowance and you can't drive—do you have any adult women you could talk to about this? Aunts? Friends' moms? You could always show your mom the calculator. If she thinks F is way too big, you could show her the [bra band project](http://www.brabandproject.com/gallery/search?band=28&cup=F&age=&brand=&sister_sizes=0&search=Search), which shows what real boobs with your measurements look like. You could even get her to measure herself. It's likely she's wearing the wrong size as well.
