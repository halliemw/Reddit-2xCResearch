I already explained why I think it's better to be tasteful with this subject in my previous comment. You're right, it'll get more views this way, but since the organization isn't accepting the PUA's money from this stunt, is it really worth it? Is it creating an image that women are free to experience sex on their own terms or that they should do it because the guys filming it talked them into it? Is this really helping anything or just furthering the images and ideas we already see everywhere?


It seems like you feel like what this video does is a positive. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but I certainly don't think it's going to be a ground breaker for any legitimate issue for many reasons, starting at the premise and ending with the execution. 

Guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
