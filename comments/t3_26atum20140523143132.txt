I love the feeling I get after I've stood up for someone. I'm not sure if it's bc I feel like I've done a good deed , that I knocked some cocky asshole off their high horse or if I just like fighting with people. Perhaps it's a combination of all that.  Humm. Anyway you did good ! I'm know the girl appreciated it. who knows how long he would have continued or if anyone else would have even spoken up.
