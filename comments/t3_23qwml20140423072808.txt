Nice article. Currently I see the same issue with my son. As a two year old most of his games involve imitating what he sees in his day to day life - especially cooking, cleaning, drinking tea (I'm British - he sees a lot of tea drinking). This is all firmly categorised under girl toys and usually come in a lurid shade of pink (not a problem to have a bit of pink about but I'd prefer some variety). Meanwhile toys that involve construction or building are filed under boys (and come in all the colours of the rainbow apart from pink).


I find this especially irritating for toddlers who have very little interest in whether they're boys or girls anyway. Playing is actually how they learn at this age. Pretend play (imitating cooking or playing with a tea set) is very important stage in development (they're developing concentration the ability to observe and imitate appropriate behaviour and also to understand that one object can represent another which paves the way for maths). The fine motor control and physical understanding from building toys is also really important as it sets the stage for learning to write and just generally understand the world. What possible reason could there be for restricting what toys a little boy or girl play with?
