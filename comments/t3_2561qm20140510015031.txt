Thanks! The parental leave is supposed to get replaced with 6 months full pay for any woman earning up to $150K. Personally, I think it's far too generous, and we don't have the means to pay the estimated 5.5B/yr it's going to cost. I'd rather they injected it into improving the hideously expensive childcare.
