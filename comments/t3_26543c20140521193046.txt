Okay. The only way I can envision this scenario existing is within the following contexts:

*The company you work for is a family run business and this man is someone's addled 85 year old grandfather who wanders around with the back of his hospital gown undone.

*Your company operates within the confines of a cult with little to no outside contact with real world issues like liability and sexual misconduct.

*You work for Sterling-Cooper in 1962.

*You work in a tiny town of with a population of 600 or fewer people in some backwater area of the US...or maybe you're outside the US entirely; and if either one of these is the case you have my abject apologies. 

It is inconceivable to me that any company no matter how small in this day and age would allow this guy access to other workers. Or, continue to employ him. Or allow you to have any kind of contact whatsoever...words fail me.

Even 40 years ago this situation would have Big Fat Lawsuit written all over it. Now, companies are more adept at handling sexual harassment (I believe there are educational packages available) and they are very limited in their tolerance of it. They know how to limit their exposure and liability and they do so swiftly.

Might not stop anything but what you describe happening simply isn't feasible. I'm not going anywhere near the rabbit hole down which you think you're qualified or that it would be in any way desirable for you to try to instill within this man empathy for your situation.

I'm 57. I've been around the block a time or two and mostly I've been in management. I've worked all over the US and I learned how to drive a forklift before I could drive a car. I know sexist environments and hostility in the workplace and all that good stuff and I know how it gets dealt with.

What you describe sounds to me like a fairy tale. Maybe it's embellished or understated, I don't know. It's a weird story filled with people who don't know how to act from the harasser to the coworkers to the administrators.

I find myself wondering how they manage to get to work every day.
