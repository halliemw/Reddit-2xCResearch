THIS THIS THIS THIS THIS!

5 years ago I was rowing competitively.  I was super fit, training 9+ times per week.  The exact pain you describe first started when I was racing - I would push myself as hard as I could go during a race, and then the minute I crossed the line and 'relaxed' I'd be hit by waves of excruciating "period" pain.  I'd be crouched over in agony, rocking myself, wanting to die.  

These days I'm nowhere near as fit, and it takes a lot less for the pain to materialise.  Sometimes a gentle jog or cycle is enough to bring it on.  The pain still sucks though - like really really bad period pain.

SO, no, you're not alone!

As to what it is... I don't know.  I've had terrible, terrible period pain since age ~12.  The exercise-induced pain started when I was ~25.  When I was 28 I was diagnosed with endometriosis (laparoscopy).  I'm 30 now and nothing (period or exercise) has changed.

I've had the exercise pain investigated by: GP ("we can't see anything wrong but we'll refer you on"), Sports Physician (blood work, x-ray, ultrasound - all "normal" - "try taking some ibuprofen before you exercise"), Surgical Gynaecologist (endometriosis diagnosis, but no relief from exercise pain), and Pelvic Physiotherapist (overactive pelvic floor).

Of all diagnoses, the overactive pelvic floor seems to make the most sense for ME.  

Do some reading about the vagus nerve, which runs the whole way down your body, including through your cervix, and then also read about the vasovagal response.   

Sorry I can't "help" other than to provide reassurance that you're definitely not alone!
