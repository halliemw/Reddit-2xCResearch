Hmmm, my thoughts on this matter could use some more developing but I don't think there is a difference between what men and women can accomplish naturally in terms of being an employee (disregarding jobs demanding great physical strength). I still think that there is a difference between what men and women gravitate towards, but maybe this is very tied up in socialization.

My main disagreement with this article is that I see it as "what about the womenz". The wage gap should not be used to detract from underperforming boys and I think it does a great disservice to the issue for the author to conflate the two.
