I'm fine with being called ma'am, because I know that most people just use it to be polite.

That being said, I'm only 21 years old, and I look young for my age. I don't mind it, but I think I'm pretty young to be called ma'am. 'Miss' would make more sense.

Just last night, a guy around my age called me ma'am, and I kinda looked around like, "Oh, you mean me?" I've only been called ma'am a few times, and always by young children, so it just felt kind of weird. 

I get that it can be pretty difficult to figure out the age at which a woman switches from ma'am to miss. I remember my mom telling me when I was young to always call a woman 'miss' unless its obvious that she's elderly, because a lot of women take it as a compliment when you call them miss, but the older ones might see it as disrespectful.
