What a twit he is! I'm so sorry, sweetie; it will be okay, I promise. It may take a while to get back to okay, but you can absolutely get there. Cry it out - it's therapeutic, even when it gives you headaches - and start finding little ways to take care of yourself. I took a lot of long hot baths and did a lot of cleaning/organizing during my last break-up. 

If you haven't already, go No-Contact with this jerk if circumstances allow you to; I suspect he's got nothing fresh to say on his behalf, and hearing from him will only make you feel worse. At the least, change his name in your contacts to, "Answering This Call Will Make You Feel Lousy" so you have to think twice whenever it pops up. Good luck, hon; don't hesitate to come to this sub if you need help getting through this lousy time! I promise that there's a far side to what you're feeling right now, and you will get there; it just takes time.
