Lego and Duplo! I played with those throughout my childhood and I still take them out on occasion as a 20-year-old. They have more girly sets and gender-neutral ones too. The Duplo were great as a little kid since the pieces are larger and more friendly for toddlers. The quality is fantastic and I spent hours upon hours with them. They're a little more expensive up front, but they stand the test of time.
