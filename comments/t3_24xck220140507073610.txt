Here's my take on it. Being anti-choice is inherently restrictive, and draws its support mainly from conservative men(come on, let's not kid ourselves) wanting to control women like in the "good old days".  Also comes the problem that anti-choicers (particularly the ones in politics) seem to stop caring about the welfare of the babies they were so vehemently defending in utero once they are born, and moreover they tend to support warfare and punitive executions. How is that pro-life in the slightest?

In short "pro-life" is a BS term, and in my opinion a lot of TwoXers seem to recognize that. There is a lot of well-founded hostility towards anti-choice sentiment. Anti-choicers regularly skirt legality in harassing and obstructing people trying to make the choice for themselves whether to keep or terminate a pregnancy, viable or otherwise. You mention contraceptive use as a positive, and guess what? Anti-choicers routinely object to its use and try to block access when they can. 

There's no way to argue this issue that makes one pro-woman if one is anti-choice. Every time anti-choice issues come up politically and socially, the effective aim is to reduce women's reproductive rights. It reduces "woman" to the sum of her reproductive capacity, making her inherently less valuable than "man". 

tl;dr: If you want to avoid backlash in a place devoted to women, don't support politics that denigrate and dehumanize them.
