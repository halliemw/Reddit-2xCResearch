I know, it seems like removing a useless organ (if you don't want bio children, that is) wouldn't be a big deal, but it has some definite risks. If your doctor isn't willing to talk to you about exactly what those risks are and what your odds of cancer are, you should probably find a new doctor. That said, considering that you're young, there's a good chance that the risks of surgery are greater than your risks of developing cancer from these pre-cancerous cells, and your risks of developing actually invasive cancer are very low if you continue to do all the screenings you're supposed to do. 

Abnormal cells don't turn into invasive, deadly cancer overnight, and really the most aggressive cancer treatment you're likely to need is a hysterectomy to remove a cancerous cervix. So basically, a preemptive hysterectomy would likely be essentially doing the most radical likely treatment if cancer develops in order to avoid having to treat the cancer when you might not even develop cancer. I don't think I worded that well, but I hope you get what I'm saying. Of course, you should speak to your doctor about this instead of just relying on internet strangers' explanations and advice, and if they won't discuss it with you, then find someone who will at least explain why they won't do it. Doctors don't have to give patients every treatment they request, but they should have to give them an explanation of why they won't give them a specific treatment.
