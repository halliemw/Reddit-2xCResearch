I just graduated with my Computer Science degree, and honestly my major wasn't a woman-friendly environment. A lot of my peers were incredibly misogynistic and it was hard to feel welcome enough to really get involved with extra-curricular Computer Science/ Programming clubs and organizations and the department in general. People wonder why more women aren't in technology fields, and often I wonder how this problem can be remedied. Unfortunately, I feel like part of the problem is the environment and that's not easily fixed.
