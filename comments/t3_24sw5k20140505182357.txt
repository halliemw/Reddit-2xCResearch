1.5 months single over 9 years tells you a lot. He isn't a whole person because he doesn't know how to be happy alone.

Be angry. I loved this exercise: grab a notebook and pen and write furiously. Everything you're thinking, stream of consciousness sort of thing. Don't proofread, don't worry about grammar or spelling. Just *write*, then destroy the paper. Do it as often as you need.

I always viewed angry as a good time to disconnect completely: get rid of anything that reminds you of him, disconnect any accounts, delete him off Facebook. By the time I'm over being angry, I'm on my own and no longer reminded of the guy. You've got this. He has no sense of who he is and a girlfriend he'll probably flake out on in two years. You've got all of TwoX. :)
