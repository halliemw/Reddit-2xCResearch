There's no way to comment on the exact nature of your lump, but I just wanted to say that lumps are very common and 99% are benign conditions. So while it's scary to have a lump, truly, usually they're nothing to worry about. If it makes you feel better, go get a second opinion. 

As for the pain you're feeling: usually, cancerous lumps are not accompanied by pain, so your soreness says nothing about the nature of the lump. 

One reason why monthly breast exams are recommended is so that you can get to know what's normal and what's not, for your breasts.
