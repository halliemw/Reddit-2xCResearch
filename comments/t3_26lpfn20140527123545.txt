Thank you for this. I read it a while ago and started thinking about those times where I have had a job. My SO didn't enjoy it as much. Sure, we were less secure financially (but we're both very frugal most of the time and live very comfortably on just his income), but he liked being able to clock off from work and come home and just relax. No dishes, no cooking dinner, no laundry, no housework. Me working didn't allow for this.

I still have plenty of hangups, but this helps. Thank you.
