This is a fabulous article and fascinating case study. I'm bookmarking this; it's useful in more places than online. I wonder what educational or behavioral theories can be tied to this to back it up, or whether there are any formal studies on it. (If I tried, I might be able to find some, but I've been avoiding homework too long...)
