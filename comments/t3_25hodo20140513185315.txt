First off, I'm sorry she's going through this. However, she is very lucky she was diagnosed so young--that's good! She will have fewer implants. I went through half a dozen doctors trying to get answers for many years before I was diagnosed at 29. 

Second, my medication is almost the same as my previous birth control, except it has a higher dose and slightly different ratio of hormones and is continuous (no sugar pills) so I never get my period anymore. While this might sound unnatural, it's the best way to minimize scarring and pain (and fertility if this is something that is important to her). It has made a world of difference. I went from almost daily pain (and a host of other unpleasant symptoms) to being functional and happy. Danazol or Lupron are alternatives, but they come with their own side effects--she should read up on them to see what she thinks. 

Third, I understand the "turned into a bitch" thing. I was on regular birth control, but because I was still having periods I was developing scar tissue and still having pain. Is she on continuous BC? Is the dose high enough?
If she doesn't have any treatment, she will continue to develop scar tissue and have pain (and if she's like me and those cysts were endometriomas, it is possible more of those could develop, too). If her case is severe enough, they could remove some of the tissue with surgery, but this isn't a 100% "cure." 

EDIT: also, there are cases of endo on the gallbladder itself, which can cause gallbladder problems--she should ask about this.
