Just wanted to weigh in on this...

I am a male nurse and have worked with many mentally handicapped persons.  I have experienced this personally and have helped many of my coworkers with these types of situations.  

First and foremost, safety is number 1.  If you feel as though the situation may escalate beyond your control.  Exit the situation and get help.

Second, set clear expectations for the right behavior.  "It is not OK for you to touch me.  You must keep your hands to yourself."  Be very firm in your tone and body launguage.  Sometimes it may take repeating it, but it establishes what is OK and what is not.

In addition, I have also found it beneficial to have someone of the same gender help communicate it.  I have often found men with these types of impulse control issues respond better to men and likewise women may respond better to other women.

What is happened is not ok.  It should not be ignored.  I can tell from your post that it truly troubled you.  Please know that the mentally handicapped that do this aren't necessarily bad people, they have bad behaviors that need to be addressed.  

You aren't supposed laugh this off.  Those other girls laughed at the situation were immature and mean.
