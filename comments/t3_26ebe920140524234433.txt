I'm glad you did the right thing. It sucks to know someone who got raped and didn't tell anyone but me, 4 years after the incident. She didn't get a rape kit so unfortunately there's pretty much nothing she can do about it. I've heard those kind of guys get a "special" treatment in prison so I hope that makes you feel better. I'm happy for you and I'm glad you respect yourself enough to not keep your mouth shut and did something about it.
