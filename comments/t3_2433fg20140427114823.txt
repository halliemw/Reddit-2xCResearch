This has happened every time my boyfriend and I go out to eat,  except for once. Yesterday our server gave the check to me without hesitation and it was so surprising I looked up in wonder. 

We had a male server which made it more notable for me because wait staff are usually female in this area. He was definitely new at his job and I wondered  if that had anything to do with it.

It would be nice if they could just ask who to give the check too.
