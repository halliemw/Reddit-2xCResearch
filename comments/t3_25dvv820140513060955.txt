you need to call the cops, so does your sister and brother. your father needs to go to jail before he kills someone. trying to force someone to stop drinking does not work. he would become a 'dry drunk' and still have the same anger issues he has now.

your mother, sister and brother need to either leave, or have a protection from abuse filed and your father removed from the home.  I know this situation so well from my own life.  

some might find it odd that your adult siblings don't leave, but that is typical of this type of codependent alcoholic household. they fear what will happen to their mother if they do. they become enmeshed. you all really need to go to Al Anon and talk to someone ASAP. glad you had the sense to move 3 hours away at least.
