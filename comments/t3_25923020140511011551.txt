THIS. I'm tearing up right now reading this. This post is my life. Preach, sista. You are so so so right, It took me more than 18 years to come to terms with the fact that, being that I have dark hair, IT'S EVERYWHERE, and you can *see* it. I only came to terms with this just now, after sending this link to my boyfriend and telling him "this post is my life," and having him give me a speech about how he likes how it feels and he thinks I'm gorgeous and incredible and he loves every hair on my body because it's *me.* That, and this post, was my turning point. YGG, and every other girl reading this, that has struggled with this at any point, YGG.
