I'm a bit late to the thread but...

Today I had one of those 'the world is amazing' days... My route to school is so pretty and the walk plus good music is an amazing start to the day. I see my friends and my amazing boyfriend. I'm the happiest I've ever been. I'm the sort of person that when in the city will notice the pretty architecture the amazing street art and the hot people while my friends are spotting all the gross things or sad things.
