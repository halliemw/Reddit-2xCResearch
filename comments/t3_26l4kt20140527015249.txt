Your brother is a douche. I'm sorry. 

There's pretty much only one thing that will work, and that's to focus on your future and work towards getting away from such a negative, boorish person before he drags you down to his level. You never know, you might inspire him to get off his ass. 

With regard to him not pulling his weight at work, do you clear up after him without showing your parents? Perhaps taking a short break might show them just how useless he is.
