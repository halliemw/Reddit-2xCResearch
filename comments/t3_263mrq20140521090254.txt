Yeah, this happens. You have to find friends who you see daily at work or at least regularly because of volunteer work or a hobby you all do. That makes it easier to socialize before or after a shift or meeting. At some point in a busy life, socializing becomes just too hard if it is not extremely convenient. But don't write off your old friends altogether unless they never reach out to you.
