Someone is being a 'bad guy'. It's clearly and forseeably an outcome of a stupid and inconsiderate decision. If a peeler bar is a 'hostile environment' then why are the decision makers seeking sexually hostile environments to conduct business? Did they forget that women exist in their workplace? Post-hoc asscovering does not make it "not sexist" it just a tacit admission that the situation is problematic.
