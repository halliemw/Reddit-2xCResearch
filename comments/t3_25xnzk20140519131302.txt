Maybe not as much, but I will agree that marketing does have its hand in an artist decision. But at the same time, this was a market that was always geared toward men. So women feeling upset they are left out is like being upset because there aren't enough men fragrances in the scented candle market. Just because I enjoy pleasant smells doesn't mean I should get upset because their new candle is "Lilly Pomegranate" instead of "Honey Smoked Ham". Until the demographic shifts to where the higher percentage of comic buyers are women, they are going to be marketed toward men.
