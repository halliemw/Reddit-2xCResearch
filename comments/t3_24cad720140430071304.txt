Getting married just because you're pregnant is a terrible idea, but if you're in a committed relationship that you see being a lifelong thing, marriage can give you and your child some legal protections that may or may not be available without marriage depending on where you live. A piece of paper doesn't change how your child will be raised or how you and your SO feel about each other, but it does change your status in the eyes of the government. 

If you don't want to get married, then don't get married, but do consult a lawyer to make sure that everything is in place to give your child all the financial security they need. You want to make sure that if anything happens to either or both of you, custody of the child is going to the right people, whether that's your partner or one of your parents or siblings, and you want to make sure that you'll both be considered legal guardians and be able to make important decisions for you child. You also might want to see if you can give your partner power of attorney so that if something goes wrong during delivery or at any point after that, he can visit you and make official decisions. Unless of course you want someone else to have that, in which case make sure they have it.

Parts of this are things that are ensured by marriage, like power of attorney and legal guardianship and who has custody of the baby if something happens to only on of you. Others are things you'd need to see a lawyer about anyway.
