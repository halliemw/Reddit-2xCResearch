Oh I have multiple distinct pooping events for you!

Once, I trusted a fart, but it was an untrustworthy fart. I've never been so grateful that I keep spare workout clothes in my desk. At school. Because the first time I shit myself in public... I was a PhD student. Yes, I'm a PhD student who can't manage to tell when she has to shit.

The other time, I got norovirus in Hawaii. Day 2 of norovirus was the birthday of the girl I was visiting Hawaii with, and I was feeling pretty okay, so I felt like we needed to do activities! First we were planning on going snorkeling at some cool bay, so I put on my swimsuit. But then I laughed too hard and shit myself, so I changed swimsuits. But then I laughed in that one too, so I had to clean them both as thoroughly as I could and decide which one was okay to go out in. Never did explain why my swimsuit was wet before we ever left the house...

You're not alone, girl.
