He would find it hot if you did those things, so what? He isn't telling you what to do, he isn't making you do anything, grow up. My girlfriend tells me stuff like that all the time and vice versa, and a lot of the time we both do the thing that the other would like, because being attractive to each other is hugely important in a relationship. If you don't want to do it, you don't have to. He is not forcing you to wear something by having an opinion on something. If you think he would look hot in something you are well within your rights to tell him and he can choose to wear it or not wear it. Stop being a victim, it's very silly. Try actually talking to your boyfriend (key to a healthy relationship) about this stuff instead of a bunch of circlejerk strangers on reddit that are going to side with you regardless because you are female.
