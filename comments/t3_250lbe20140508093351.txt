Hi! I think we might be hair twins and I truly empathize.

My hair is currently just longer than a chin length bob (so really long for me) and if I pull it all into a ponytail it's about as big around as my pinky finger, and I have skinny fingers. So yeah, about a half inch diameter. I really don't want to wear my hair short but there aren't any other options besides wigs or extensions and I'm not ready to go there yet.

It's so demoralizing when the overwhelming message from media is that you have to have nice hair to be an attractive woman. Nice hair meaning long and normal thickness. I get frustrated about the perceptions of women with short hair, whether it's unfeminine, grandma-ish, or edgy - none of those describe me. Have you ever noticed that when a celeb cuts her hair short it never stay short for long? Almost immediately they start growing it back.

And yeah, when you say you have fine, thin hair, most people don't have a frigging clue as to what that really means. Even hair stylists don't know how to cut it right sometimes.
