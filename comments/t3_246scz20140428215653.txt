That doesn't mean it's normal for them to be reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes. There are a lot of women out there in the world, who are in a relationship with a man, or have been cheated on by them, but their life doesn't end there. It was a lot deeper than that relationship in the first place. Do we really need to have a REASON to give female characters depth? Why do we have to justify anything more than a stereotype when it comes to women?
