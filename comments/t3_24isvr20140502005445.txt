well, I was first going to tell you that you didn't need a new school, just a new group of friends, but the whole private school thing changed the dynamic. you definitely need to find some new friends either way. public schools are A LOT different and a lot bigger, especially depending on what areas you live in. have you talked to your parents about what's all going on? are they on board with letting you transfer? if you go to a public school you'd probably have to go to the one in your school district, which depends on which zone your house is located in. sometimes schools won't allow transfers from different zones unless they're being invited to the school to be in a special program like IB or Magnet, but that all depends on the school and such.
