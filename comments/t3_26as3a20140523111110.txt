Was there another link submitted link to it then? I just looked and couldn't find one. I think your point about the age of the story is specious. I have seen plenty of old stories dredged up and discussed. 

Just the other day there was a CNN story from over a year ago concerning a surrogate mother who was offered $10,000 to abort the child. It reached the frontpage of the sub and had nearly 300 comments. 

My explanation, based on my 4 years of experience with this subreddit, is that the user bases tends to be incredibly politically correct. That's why they are less likely to upvote a story that shows the real world consequences of political correctness. Something like this disrupts the "liberal circle-jerk."
