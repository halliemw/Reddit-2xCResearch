Sitting next to strangers for 2 hours, wearing an outfit that nobody looks good in (pretty sure I look like a big tent), worrying if I'll make it across the stage without embarrassing myself...

I'm going to pursue an accelerated second degree nursing program (my current degree is a BA in psychology). So, in about 2 years, my job prospects should definitely go up! Now, if only I could find a job in the meantime not in retail or fast food...
