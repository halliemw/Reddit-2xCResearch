I have to echo others and say make a sustainable plan.  Reach out to family members and see if there is anyone you could stay with for a few days or a week until you find your own place.   Scour craigslist or other sites looking for people who need a roommate.  Ask your friends. 

I was in a very similar situation.  My husband held me against the wall by my neck and our roommate had to get him off me.  I ran out and I haven't been back.  I've been staying with my in laws (they're still more upset than I am) until I start my new job and I'll be moving in with a friend as soon as I get my first pay check.

When I was sitting in a gas station in my pajamas and socks, my mind went to the absolute worst places but things have fallen into place.  If there's a will, there's a way.

Also- you are your own greatest asset.  You are a wonderful, strong woman and you will get through this.
