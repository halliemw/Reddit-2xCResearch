It's BS. Depends on the kind of guys you're going after. Sure, a lot of  older men will find a 21 year old sexually attractive, but is that someone they actually want to have a relationship with? 

In some cases the age can be relative depending on maturity level, but very few mature men want to date your average 21 year old. As people mature, etc., age becomes less of a thing, but to say all men want young women is just not correct.
