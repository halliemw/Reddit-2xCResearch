Thank you for being one of the first to give your thoughts on my question there at the end. 

It's not an ultimatum - he has said he can continue to be in our relationship day-to-day, but that he could never marry a non-believer. 

>what if you were willing to give it a chance? What if you set a trial period (a few months?) and said, "Okay, God. I like this guy, so give me your best shot." Find a Bible and figure out what parts to read. Get in the habit of praying, even if it seems silly. He doesn't do it now, but maybe you could both try going to church a few times- that's something great that you can do together. Really give it your all. Take a test drive.

I'm really just trying to figure out the answer to your questions here. Can I do this? Hearing other's opinions and thoughts is helping me formulate the answer to this question. This is definitely his preferred course of action.

>She started going to church, maybe attended a Bible study, made other friends who were Christians... The couple didn't talk about it much during that time. She didn't want to feel any expectations from him, and I guess talking about it made her feel like she had to offer some kind of report as to how it was going.

Yes. This.

I wish I was 22 or 23 and not two months from 29. There is some sense of urgency to "get it all figured out" quickly, and not potentially "waste time".

Thank you again.
