I was asking about you moving out because if you talk to her and she doesn't care then your options are taking it up with the landlord, or leaving yourself.

>I feel like she knows exactly how much the girlfriend stays over, but she doesn't care - I done't know, it's like she used the fact that I was busy and out of the house a lot to just make it happen and by the time I realized it, it was common place.

Is she that kind of person? I'd try talking to her before you write the situation off.
