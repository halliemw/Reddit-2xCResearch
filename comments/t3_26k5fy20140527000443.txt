Because we as a society seem to be conditioned to look at a potential father as a breadwinner - kids means he's not going to start working fewer hours, he's going to work longer so he can support his family.

Plus, women themselves demand to spend more time with their children - something your average potential father is not going to do.

I know its not fair but it is reality!
