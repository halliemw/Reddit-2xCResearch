Because politicians look at the US and see that culture war is a really effective way of dividing the population and distracting them from other important issues.

The same thing is happening in the UK with Cameron and his bullshit 'the UK is a Christian country with Christian ideals'.  Complete shite, that man doesn't have a Christian bone in his body, he's just looked at the states and realised that it's a great way to get into people's heads. It's hard to believe it's only been just over a decade that people/media in the UK were freaking out that Tony Blair stated he read the bible before going to bed. I remember people were clear then that government should be secular, now everyone's questioning this because we are a 'Christian nation'.
