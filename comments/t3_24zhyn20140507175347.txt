>Don't make fun of fat people in front of your daughter; don't be one of those dads who persistently shames their daughters about what they wear. 

So, my dad and I were talking the other day. He mentioned to me that while it took him a few months, he got what my mom (the psych & education major) was telling him: *everything* is a teaching experience for a parent and a learning experience for a child. Kids absorb stuff all the time. They see if you are clearly treating people of a certain race different or if you seem to make fun of fat people or if you are consistently kind or conscientious or whatever. 

Everyone here telling you to treat her as your kid, not your daughter/other - spot on too.

You're asking questions & asking for help, which is one of the best things you can teach a kid to do :) Good start!
