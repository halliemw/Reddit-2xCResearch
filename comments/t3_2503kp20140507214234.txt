> What matters more to a person like yourself is being right, not being helpful or supportive. 

Are you saying in general, or in this specific case? If in general - that's obviously utterly unsupported (and incorrect), but if in this specific case - well yeah, obviously, I am talking to you, not the OP, and I am not looking to help you or support you.

Same goes for you, of course. You are not looking to help me or support me, you are looking to justify the use of a drastically incorrect statement that meant something different from what you said.

> If you want to stop by later and debate the definitions of rights, I would be happy to oblige you.

Not that I would necessarily mind, but this is no way connected to either this thread, or what I was saying. How did this come up?

> Otherwise, if you are capable of supporting this OP go for it.

Um... explain to me why you are telling me what to do? I am sure you understand that I can make my own decisions about what to do. Why are you giving me instructions?
