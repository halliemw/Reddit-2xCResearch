Before you take any drastic steps why don't you talk to someone, your boyfriend and a counsellor. Really get all your thoughts out. Have you confronted this person or does he know why you don't talk to him? (I'm not saying that you should, I am just wondering some of the background information). How long has he lived there now? Is your anxiety worsening? Have you seen him? Has he tried to make contact?
