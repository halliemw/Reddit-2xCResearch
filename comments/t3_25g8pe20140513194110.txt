I never said all of these groups were terrorists. They are all, however, fundamentally religious. Outside of the cameras and the Duggar's TV show the Quiverfull movement has an entire dark underside that's being sugarcoated by the "polite religious family" veneer.

I was raised in an Independent Baptist Church, homeschooled, and directly knew people like this. The Duggars are not a realistic representation of the movement, but instead a whitewashed, fake Brady Bunch version. What happens instead is you have ten children in a family, with preteen girls raising and homeschooling their younger siblings because their parents are too busy working to feed the dozen children they can barely afford and reproducing to make more. These kids get an extremely substandard, censored education, rarely leave their house (sometimes only to go to church), and graduate into a life where they *maybe* go to college, but even then only a fundamentalist Christian College that tailors to the lifestyle they left, such as Bob Jones University, where they'll find a spouse, marry before the age of twenty and repeat the cycle. They don't know better because they've never gotten outside of their fundamentalist bubble.

Any religion that has the word "Apostate" in its vocabulary is guaranteed to be a bad one. The Quiverfull movement is no exception. They not only believe that using birth control is a sin, but that *not* having as many children as you are capable is a direct violation of God's will. The damage this does to infertile couples, gays and impressionable young teens within the movement, particularly girls, is extensive. They're raised to believe that God created them for the sole purpose of breeding. 

Don't believe what the Duggars tell you. That show is guilty of major lies of omission.
