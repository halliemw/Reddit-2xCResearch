It is, and the discussions can be focused on a women's perspective of everything I said.  Also, on the same line it says gender issues are acceptable as well.  Given my stories (assumed to be 'feminine' by our society) and me being gender queer I feel like this is an acceptable place.  If it makes you feel any better I am learning more about being a woman here because I am getting all the lovely hate mail from people calling me all kinds of names.
