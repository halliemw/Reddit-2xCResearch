Short version:

-Contact stun guns start at *much* lower prices than Tasers, but they require physical contact (their reach is only as long as your own, which may be shorter than your attacker's). They act by creating pain, and require you to continue to maintain contact with both prongs, ideally for quite some time. As soon as you move away, the other person stops being affected and starts recovering (remember that you are in arms reach at this point).

-A Taser C2 (the cheap, most easily concealable one) costs about $400. Get that out of the way immediately. However, it has a 15ft range, and works by pulsing electricity to stop the targets muscle from functioning properly - even if they can fight through the pain (possible with stun guns), their muscles will not respond to commands. The Taser fires barbed prongs that stick in the skin, and the cartidge continues to deliver electricity, so you can fire, then run away. Be aware, though, that Tasers are not foolproof - at very close range the barbs may not separate far enough to fully disable a person, one or both may not properly penetrate, and simple expedients like heavy clothing may work as functional armor (true with stun guns as well).

As Taser is great, but at low cost I'd definitely recommend pepper spray over a contact stun gun. "Not being in grabbing/stabbing distance" is kind of a huge consideration for defense options.
