Not uncommon and not unlawful. I've only been in the workforce for 8 years (in the USA), but there hasn't been a single job where I have not been hit on by strangers, co-workers, and/or superiors. Examples include "hey can I have your number?", "do you want to get a drink after this?", "nice outfit today. You should wear that more often", etc. 

While I certainly wouldn't qualify any of these as sexual harassment, they can become rather uncomfortable to respond to in the workplace. I've grown a thicker skin about it in the past few years and instead of responding with a stutter, blush, and awkward shuffle away, I now find it much more simple to just say "no" and then find a task to get back to/ distract them with. Awkward attempts at romance in the workplace are just that - awkward attempts.

If a dude lays a hand on any part of my body without my permission though, he better expect to fucking lose it. A simple grip and twist usually does the trick.
