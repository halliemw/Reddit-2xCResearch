> Read, read, read. Books are truly the best company. If you want any recommendations, PM me.

Find a quiet corner or get some comfy and huge cushions for your bed to cuddle up with a nice cup of tea or coffee and a good book when you're feeling a bit down. It's a great way to take your mind off things. 

Congrats on this big step!
