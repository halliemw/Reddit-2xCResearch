I'm having a similar experience. For the most part it's lovely being on my own but there are admittedly scary, lonely moments. Getting through those moments on my own gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes me feel stronger. 

Most people have suggested taking up a hobby. I'm going for bird watching and volunteering at a local rescue. 

I really believe that once I'm at a better place with myself I'll be better prepared to create a more fulfilling relationship with someone and I hope you do too! :)
