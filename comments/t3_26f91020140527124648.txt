Thank you for pointing that out! I'll be making my way over right now. 

I like being single. I'm not interested in having a man to deal with, nor am I trying to cope with being single...in fact, I'm starting to wonder what's wrong with me that I'm not upset over it. Wedding pictures on Facebook always make me roll my eyes a bit... Ah, well. Sorry for the digression!
