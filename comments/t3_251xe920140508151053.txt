As a long-time married person I would observe this:  I was never so brittle or difficult to get along with in my marriage as when I was feeling like I was not pulling my weight.  You say that he left a high-paying job he hated:  I suspect he feels anxiety because he used to have no trouble looking at bills but now he feels nervous.  He may not even be overtly aware that he's nervous about it.  Going from not having to worry about bills to being stretched, particularly when it was a choice, particularly when it was because he hated the job, may be making him feel just plain bad.  In my time, I felt guilty when the bank account was low even if my wife didn't know about it.  I was hard to live with because of it.

Nothing would help more in this situation than to drop casual comments that (1) you're okay financially, and (2) you think his job change was a good decision.  

You could be saying things like, "well, whatever else may be happening, at least you're out of that terrible job.  I'm glad we finally got that behind us."

And, "I wondered if we were going to be all right with your new job, and it sure looks okay now."
Looking back on my thirty years of marriage I was way too worried about finances, and I regret those times I displaced my anxiety onto people around me.

A counsellor is partly there to help you figure out what's wrong.  I suspect that this is what's wrong, and telling your partner that you're okay, that things are good, is how you fix it.
