Exactly. As a writer, I am in awe of Lena's ability to create characters we simultaneously love and hate. There are parts of each of the characters that I can relate to on some level. The show seems to resonate with women most, obviously, but I don't think anyone is looking up to these characters as role models. They're slightly magnified caricatures.
