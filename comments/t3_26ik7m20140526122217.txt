Wow, maybe the jeggings you've seen are a lot different to the ones I buy then...I have seen a few really thin cheap ones that sound like that, usually labelled something like 'denim-look legging' but proper ones are great IMO. Definitely no cameltoe or visible panty lines, 100% opaque material, look exactly like skinny jeans apart from the lack of zip (actually, I do have some with a zip/button as well) - they're probably only the tiniest bit thinner than most of my normal (admittedly cheap) jeans. It seems like here 'jegging' mostly just seems to mean stretchy skinny jeans.
