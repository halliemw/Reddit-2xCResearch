This sounds like an overreaction on your part.  In most workplaces, it would be better for two engaged people NOT to work side by side in a shared workspace.  There are all sorts of reasons why that's a bad idea.

Let's say your fiance told his boss "well, she's my fiance, so perhaps it would be better if we weren't in the same office".  You should thank your fiance for being smart about the workplace rather than getting upset at him.
