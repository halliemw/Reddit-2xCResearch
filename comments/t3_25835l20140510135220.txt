Pack some wet wipes (or other cleansing cloth that won't disrupt your lady flora) and use those while changing tampons to keep things tidy. I am far from a camping expert (what is the outdoors anyway???) but I imagine if you have something ready to clean up any leaks or accidents you will have some peace of mind. Enjoy your trip!!
