I have Mirena, which is the non-copper one. Apparently it's pretty common as [their website](http://www.mirena-us.com/after-mirena-placement/) mentions a possibility of slowing or stopping periods altogether! I used to get incredibly sick during that week, so having it gone completely has been the most amazing feeling (you know, along with the whole no pregnancy thing).
