We have had plenty of conversations about what we both want long term. We know that's what we want. I'm not really looking for advice on whether I'm in the right relationship or anything like that. We have had many, many conversations about what we both want, how we want things, how we think everything we want fits into our life and career goals and everything else. I'm not putting my life on hold or anything like that. I'm basically just really happy and kind of like a kid looking in their mom's closet for Christmas presents but it's July.
