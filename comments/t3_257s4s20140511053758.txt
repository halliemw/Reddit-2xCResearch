Thank you for your support. I'm so sorry you had to go through something similar, no one deserves that kind of treatment. Internet hugs, if you'd like them. 

The couple of people close to me whom I have told have been unwavering in their support, but, of course, I chose them carefully for this reason. I'm definitely going to take on board your advice about viewing critically those who do not take my experiences seriously. I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that my sense of violation is important, though it's difficult at times. I'm not sure I want professional help for this specifically, but I'm already "in the system" as it were for treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and I'm currently undergoing EMDR treatment for elements of Post-Traumatic Stress concerning OCD triggers. In this way, I have therapeutic/psychiatric help available to me on a regular basis - so if I ever do decide that professional help is what I need, I'm in a good place to get it. 

Thank you again for your comment and affirmative words.
