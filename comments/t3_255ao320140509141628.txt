Oh man, I had almost forgotten when we went to Egypt when I was ten. My hair is almost black-brown, and I was ten, so I wasn't particularly noticeable, but my eighteen-year-old sister had blonde hair and was constantly approached. 

The funniest/least creepy part (to me, anyway) of her harassment was that almost every single time we were taking a photo of her, some young guy would casually saunter into the frame and just stand a few meters behind her, or a few feet away from her. It was hilarious to me at the time, because... I mean... it's not like we were gonna send them a copy of the photo. I still have no idea what they were getting out of that.
