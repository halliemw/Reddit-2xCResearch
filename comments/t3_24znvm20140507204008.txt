Before it goes crazy, I just want to say how much this forum has meant to me. It has been truly incredible seeing so many women come together to support each other and to try so hard to be open minded about every topic that has come up. You all truly and absolutely rock. Thanks for showing me how amazing we can be when we decide to support each other.
