> It is common for people who oppose dialogue

  I don't oppose dialoge, and I don't claim that there aren't real differences in treatment.  I am simply suggesting that there are some feminists out there that go about things the wrong way, and that, for whatever reason, those are the ones who are most visible, and thus distort the perception of what feminism is trying to achieve.

> we cannot reduce all humans to a set of identical particles, we cannot ignore or reject the way that diversity in human identity creates a a richer and more complex narrative.

  Quite right.  Character, personality, life experiences are individual and unique.  Rights are homogeneous, universal, and invariable,  (well, should be).

  That right there is where you lose my support!   That is precisely the sort of thing I was talking about.  That sounds exactly like the Them vs Us thing that was mentioned in the other thread.  The more you try to emphasize differences, and to imply that women's issues are somehow more valid ... more equal than others, the more people will resent what you are saying, and what you stand for.

> would you want to be seen as not male

  It's not a hard life, but there are times when I'm afflicted by the fragility and complexity that is humanity when I'm simply told to man up, where a woman might be treated more sympathetically.  On those occasions, I might want to be treated, based on my state of mind, not how my gender is expected to behave, yes.
