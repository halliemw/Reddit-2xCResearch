I wish you the best of luck in finding happiness and love. Ultimately never forget it is your choice how to live your life.

I am by no means any type of expert, this is just my humble opinion after 16 years of marriage with children and living over 40 years on this Earth, and I also know many in the Church:


- Unless the person keeps you hanging on, no matter how hot or perfect, the longer you are with someone, the more the little things become big problems. Once you "have" him your focus will turn to what you are missing in the relationship. 

- The more religious a man, the less rights a women has over her body and the less he will agree with your choices that go against his faith.

- The soul-mate of someone religious, is someone who shares the same vision of how to live life and the path to the after life.  

- Most marriages are hard, most women married > 5 years have serious gripes with their men. "Men get lazy, and women get crazy" is a line a mother I know told me once..


**if he fully accepts you.. I mean respects you and your choices because he loves you no matter his faith, then he may be the one.  But if he is going to put his faith over his love and respect for you, dictate what you can think/say, you run the risk of having a very hard painful time.**

Consider him loving God and his rules more than you.. how would that make you feel if it were the case?

Remember this is your ticket to the journey of life, don't get on the wrong train.  Be careful and best of luck.
