Yes. But there are more moms making minimum wage then anyone else (aside from teenagers and dropouts probably...). The article did not choose to ignore men either. 

>And, not to be left out, 11.6 percent, or 2.6 million, working dads would also see a raise if we increased the minimum wage. Thatâ€™s over 7 million parents who would see an increase in wages.
