Me too. They were the best. We should reread them and message earch other. Its probably been 15 years since I read it, but it was one of those books that stays with you.

I also loved Shabanu by Suzanne Fisher Staples. They seem similar to me. Shabanu is a 12 year old girl that gets sent off to be married in Pakistan to an old man. Very sad and heartfelt.
