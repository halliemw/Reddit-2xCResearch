That was a really eye opening article. I started reading thinking "I don't know anyone that's been randomly groped like that" but as I carried on reading I saw several posts that made me remember instances where I or someone I knew had had unwanted contact (not just female friends either). Of the ones I can remember, many were at work at my last job, where reporting it would have done nothing other than get me considered some kind of killjoy or told that it was 'okay because he's gay.' Pretty scary, really.
