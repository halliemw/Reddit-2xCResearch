Every woman is at risk of being a slut though.  So it is against women in general.  Because the term is so fluid and used at will against people for acting "too friendly" with a member of the opposite sex, dressing 'sexy', dancing 'sexy', having many male friends, drinking "too much", having sex etc...     every woman is potentially a slut to those people who use that language.
It's also a term that is used almost exclusively against women.
