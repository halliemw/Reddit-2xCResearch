Sometimes I don't want to wear a bra because going without one would be more comfortable, but the vast majority of the time I wear one anyway, either because my boobs are big enough that going bra-less makes the shape of my clothes look much less flattering, or because I don't want be judged for it. I was able to carefully craft an outfit for New Years Eve with my friends that was bra-less. I don't think anyone noticed. It was great. If I had small enough boobs, I'd go bra-less much more.
