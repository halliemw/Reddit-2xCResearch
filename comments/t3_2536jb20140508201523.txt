My story is a little atypical since I was supposed to be on 150mg and they accidentally gave me 300mg. I was fidgety for the next few days until I figured it out.

In any case, WB has been amazing for me. SSRIs make me mega irritable for some reason, but because WB is some weird non-class of drug, it doesn't work the same way and therefor I have none of the same issues. 

As far as I know, especially since you're taking it in the AM, you shouldn't have sleep issues. I don't think it would interact with you BC, but you should definitely ask your doctor. Call them when you can and find out
