Aside from the BC issue OP clearly mentioned that she's on antidepressants and that she'd have to stop using prescribed medicine for a pregnancy. If OP suffers from clinical depression that isn't going to go away on its own, plus I can't even begin to imagine the postpartum depression that could come from that, because odds are that she might not be allowed to use her medication again until she stops breast feeding should she have a baby.

Lastly, why not? She clearly appears to be sure of her decision to the point of agreeing to surrender her rights to sue any doctors that perform the procedure on her. She is a 23 year old woman that wants autonomy over her body by saying "no biological clock for me."
