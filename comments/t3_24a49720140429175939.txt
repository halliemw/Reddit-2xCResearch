Oldest brother: "When you are extremely dramatic and say hurtful things to provoke a reaction, it makes me lose faith in you and makes me less interested in having a relationship with you. And no, you can't buy back my love every time, although I appreciate that you have means and that you are generous with them. Words hurt."

SO: "When you refuse to show me affection or intimacy in the ways I crave, I feel unloved regardless of how you feel comfortable showing your love. I would prefer regular admiration and openness to whatever we have going on right now. I want you to love me on my level, not expect me to meet some arbitrary standard that you have for relationships."

Mother: "When you meet honest criticism with anger, denial, and the feeling that you have been disrespected, it makes me feel like you don't care about changing yourself for the better, and I worry that however open-minded you are about certain things, you are internally bigoted and dogmatic. I want to be able to open up with you, but I don't think I can."

That's my short list. This was nice and cathartic :)
