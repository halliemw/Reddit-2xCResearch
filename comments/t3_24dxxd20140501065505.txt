I had the total opposite issue in Australia, I was seeing a physiotherapist for continance issues and was paying out of pocket, I couldn't afford it so I hunted around, found a PT who was cheaper because she was only qualified to deal with sexual dysfunction, I figured 'better than nothing' turns out that she is covered by insurance almost completely.

I dug a bit deeper and found that the real reason the sexual dysfunction PT is covered and the continence PT is not is because the sexual function PT puts her claims in as "preventative" treatment because treating pelvic pain when its just pelvic pain can help avoid incontinence and prolapse. Insurance companies are more likely to pay for preventative treatments then they are for actually fixing an illness.

This isn't a big deal in Australia and doesn't normally effect rebates. What was effecting my rebate was that the incontinence PT was being processed as "Gastroenterology Physiotherapy", gastroenterology is covered by public healthcare, Physiotherapy Is covered by private,  "Gastroenterology Physiotherapy" is covered by neither. it was the horrible limbo of coverage. The sexual dysfunction Physiotherapy falls solely under physiotherapy and pain management, so it is covered by private.

I'm thankful because my funds are low and the few people I talked too about borrowing money have laughed in my face, saying that 'sexual dysfunction' is not a real thing and 'so what' if it hurts all the time, I'm a woman and my pleasure doesn't matter. (in not so many words)

A few times I have not spared them the details, and explained manual bowel evacuation and external pressure urination, to which they reply "That's disgusting. You're disgusting. Sort that shit out" .... Grrr, that's what I'm *trying* to do!
