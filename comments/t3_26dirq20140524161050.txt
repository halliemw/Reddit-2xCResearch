I can see how the ideal situation is to refer to professionals in a gender neutral way, and I think that is the direction we should be heading in. However, we all know that there is sexism occurring in our society. I think when someone is actively working against the stereotypes against their group, it is not at all offensive to refer to them as a member of their group fighting for their group. 

For example, is it offensive to say that Rosa Parks was a black woman fighting for her rights during the Civil Rights movement? It identifies her as a member of a discriminated group fighting that discrimination. I don't think there is anything wrong there from a descriptive journalistic standpoint.   

EDIT: I also think it's important to note that describing Neko Case as a "musician breaking the mold" would be inaccurate. The article is specifically describing how Neko Case is writing music that breaks into the area that has traditionally been covered by men in the industry. So it's not really new ground for musicians, but it is new grounds for female musicians.
