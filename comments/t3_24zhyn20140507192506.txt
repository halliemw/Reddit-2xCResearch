The best thing about my parents is that we always had a huge book shelf and they would read a book to me every night. Each had their voices and characters to step into (Mom was a great witch, Dad was the troll under the bridge, whatever). Read to your little girl and make it fun if you can. Don't get exhausted if she asks for the same book thirty nights in a row, because she's learning it. 

I think that made a huge difference in my life. Something as simple as getting to hear the Three Billy Goats Gruff as much as I wanted to. I learned to read early, I still love books and learning, and I'm going places. 

I was always a daddy's girl, mostly because of time spent reading bed time stories.
