Assholes who want to harass other individuals are expert at coming up with reasons why it's "okay" for them to do so. It's the sort of thing perpetuated by people with delusions of entitlement, and they exist in pretty much any demographic. And I wouldn't say that gay people stand out as individuals perpetuating it.
