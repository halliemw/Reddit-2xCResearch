If there wasn't such a stigma around being adopted or the product of a sperm donation, there wouldn't be any reason not to bring children into the world this way. But jerks will relentlessly ask these children if they know their "real parents"; as if the folks who willfully brought them into their family aren't their real parents.

It's always awesome when some fringe group targets the technology instead of the shitty attitudes people have around the technology. 

Thankfully:

> Last fall, the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the lower court's decision, ruling there is no constitutional right to know the identity of one's parents.

> Pratten asked the Supreme Court of Canada to intervene, but on Thursday, the high court said it would not hear the case. As usual, the court did not provide its reasons for refusing to hear the appeal.
