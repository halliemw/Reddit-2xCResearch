I was 12. I was horrified. I had extreme cramps and felt really sick. When I saw the blood I was thinking "no, no, dear God, nooooo"! I started crying and told my mom. She tried to comfort me and told me about how girls in other countries were celebrated for having their first period, and that it was natural (duh) and a good thing. I had become a woman,  something I felt sad about - because I felt that I was too young. I just wanted to be a girl,  not a WOMAN. Little did I know that the PCOS also kicked in then (started having weight issues after that) - so I guess in a way I had a good reason to be sad.
