Many years ago I had a job cleaning a bowling alley after hours and I can assure you that men are just as able as women to get all matter of bodily fluids onto the ceiling..

I've also had the pleasure of walking into the men's restrooms on several occasions to see broken beer bottles shoved down the toilets, plastic wrap on the seats, and nachos in the urinals.  Women are messy and disgusting but never destructive like that.
