Again, I'm not advising that she become a disciplinarion. Or make her own rules.

I'm advocating that when she is whitness to the children breaking the rules that are already set in place, she does something about it. She holds them responsible. 

The co-parenting between the husband and wife is very important, absolutley. But I'm sorry, it's not a 2 parent family anymore. There are 3 parents now. I will agree that the step-parent is not on the same 'level' as the others, but she is still important. Her views on raising children matter. And she should have the right to punish the children when they do wrong. 

Also, It may come across that my most important peice of advise is to discipline the kids. That's not it. Nor do I advocate physical punishment! I just think this is an area where the kids can easily get the impression that she (1) has no authority as a parent or guardian (2) Is therefore somehow weak (3) Wants to share in the good stuff, not around for the bad.
