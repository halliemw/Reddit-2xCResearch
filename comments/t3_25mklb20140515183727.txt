Yes but Abramson doesn't have half the experience that Keller had. Keller had been working in this career field for 33 years when he got the job and Abramson had been working for 39 years when she got the job. Keller had worked for NYT for 19 years continuously before getting the job, Abramson had worked at the NYT for 17 years (14 continuously) before getting the job. 

If Keller's salary went up every year he was the editor then I can see why there'd be a difference between what Keller was getting and what Abramson was getting at the time. Otherwise I don't. And I don't see what the problem is with getting a lawyer to check these things for her.
