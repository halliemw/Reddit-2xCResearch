Those places are definitely great, but they also have a much, much smaller audience. I think it would be helpful to have the occasional discussion involving race on bigger subs as well, instead of shifting every single one to the smaller, more specific subs.

Like I said, I don't want to exclude anyone. I don't want anyone to not contribute, at all. I just want people to be aware of what they say. That's all. How else are people going to learn about different experiences, and that they exist at all, if we can't focus on less white-centric problems every now and then?

How would you recommend rewording the title? I'm not sure how it could be more specific than "...Acceptability of Black Women's Bodies?" I hope that doesn't sound sarcastic, I'm truly curious.
