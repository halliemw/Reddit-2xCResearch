My daughter got her first training bra at 8 and is hurtling toward puberty/periods and the like now (she's almost 10). The mood swings are FUN! She's also easily one of the tallest in her class at school and gets mistaken for around 12.

We had the period talk early on as I was an early-ish bloomer so I wanted her to be prepared. Thankfully they make towels and liners in smaller sizes for younger girls now.

As for advice, maybe drop a subtle hint that you'll be there for your sister if she needs to know anything?
