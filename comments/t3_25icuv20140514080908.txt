You let him walk 3-4 blocks with his hand on your ass? Now don't get me wrong, I'm not justifying what he did at all, but if you allow a guy to be forward with you he might take it further next time. For future, the second a guy does something you deem inappropriate just tell him straight. And yea he sounds a bit like a dick so don't worry so much about your social scene, those things tend to sort themselves out. Why not get hobbies or something outside reddit where you can meet people, like a running group or something.
