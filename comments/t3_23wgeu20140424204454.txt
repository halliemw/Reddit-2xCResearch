Before you panic, why don't you ask him to explain what he meant?

It's not terribly original to fetishize people with dark pasts. People succeeding in the face of adversity, or because of it, is a common theme across human culture and lots of people find it attractive. Mysterious stranger with a dark past describes a huge percentage of heroes.

Wanting to help people who have struggled, and finding them attractive because of their struggles, is a human thing. Both men and women do it.

It feels to me like you're reading things into this that just aren't there. Anyway, insofar as you care at all about this person, I think you ought to give him the chance to explain himself, at the very least.
