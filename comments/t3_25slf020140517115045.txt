I work at an outdoor retailer. My passion is rock climbing and I pride myself on my knowledge about it. It's a very male dominated sport. I get guys coming into the store all the time that say "no sweetheart I don't need any help". Only to turn around a second later to one of my male coworkers to ask them for help. Many times I'm one of the only people in the store that has the technical know-how. It's really satisfying to see the guys faces dumbfounded when I start rattling off specs they don't understand.
