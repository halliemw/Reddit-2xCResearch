Thrift stores all the way. If you can fund some in nicer areas is town, the quality of clothing will probably be better without a change in price (at least, that's what I've found).

Another feet place to check would be jc Penney. I've found dresses and shirts very cheaply on clearance there, sometimes even under $5. Also kohl's might have some good deals. I would shoot for possibly another pair of dress pants or two, a knee-length suit skirt, two or so pairs of shoes, and three to four tops. A suit jacket possibly too. That should be plenty to mix and match for a while.

Places vary on how formal their dress code is, but a google image search for "business clothes women" or something similar will probably you some ideas. Generally, you want your chest and belly covered (as in, no cleavage), and maybe a bit dressy, like something you would wear to an interview. You could try to observe the kinds of clothes other women in the office wear when you expand your wardrobe, so you'll have an idea of what's acceptable there. You could probably also ask what te company dress code is, or if there is one even.
