This man is easily turning his back on someone who is carrying his child and someone he made a commitment to. Do you seriously think he won't do that same thing to you when the next girl comes along? Please don't kid yourself into thinking you're special or different. You're just something new. You say you don't want to be a home wrecker but you are. You are in control of what you do and who you see. You made the choice to interfere with a married man and now you are essentially asking for your behavior to be condoned. If you cared at all about Troy you would urge him to do the right thing and you would find yourself a single person to be with. You do not love a person when you contribute to adultery, divorce, a life separate from their child and encourage a mininum wage worker to incur 18 years of child support. Long after you are forgotten Molly will be a struggling single parent. Troy will be an impoverished, absent father and an innocent child will miss out on having a whole family. If you loved anyone you would be encouraging Troy to work things out with his wife. But that's the problem. You clearly don't love yourself let alone Troy. If you loved yourself you would want better for yourself. You would feel like you deserved a man who is single and emotionally mature. It's not too late to but out of this and recover a modicum of decency. I find it outrageous that you would seek approval for your behavior. YOU are the most toxic element in this whole situation. YOU.
