He did have good intentions I think. I'm not sure what caught me so off guard. I guess because it was just totally out of the blue. Also I mean I guess he was just pointing out a fact, that yep, I've gotten fatter. It's not like he was trying to be...overly insulting or something. 

I guess it's just like, well bro, if I knew all the reasons and motivations behind why I've been eating to compensate for my feelings don't you think I would have fixed them already? Really, it's obvious I've gained weight. It's not as if I hadn't noticed. You know? 

Maybe I'm just being a baby I dunno. I just felt like it was something that I've felt powerless to change lately, having it made clear to me that it really is a glaring change, that people do notice how horrible I've become...that is I guess what hurt my feelings.
