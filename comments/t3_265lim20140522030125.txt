Um, what? In the link you give the study mentions a self reported **4%** while other studies showing various results of 10%-50% or lubrication/orgasm. That is not often in any understanding of the word. 

Like I said. It can happen. And to address your first post, there is nothing non sensical about it. An orgasm can be a bodily reflex. If I hit your knee a certain way your foot will bounce.
