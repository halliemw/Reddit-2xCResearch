Also, if you can drop the cash, synthetic underwear is a nice thing to have when you're hiking. Something like [this](http://www.exofficio.com/products/details/womens-give-n-go-lacy-bikini) or [this](http://www.patagonia.com/us/product/womens-active-hipster-underwear?p=32407-0) in a dark color is really great because it wicks away the sweat/blood/tears and you won't feel like you're in a wet diaper all day if something happens. They're also easy to clean in a river and will dry quickly. I like to keep cotton underwear for the night time to keep things fresh down there. 

If you can wait, REI is having a 20% off coupon next week for members and they sell both of these brands!
