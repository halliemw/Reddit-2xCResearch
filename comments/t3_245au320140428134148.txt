He needs to stop blaming you for being bad at sex, he needs to promise that he's going to be gentle, and you both need to realize chemistry doesn't change the fact that you just lost your virginity. Essentially you both (he is being pretty difficult IMO, but you need to have the strength of character to *not* stand for painful sex or insults---either through working it out or by leaving him) need to be more mature about this. That includes being realistic and communicative, before, during, and after sex. You need to be able to say "Hey boyfriend, it hurts when you go so fast/deep" and he needs to respect that immediately.
