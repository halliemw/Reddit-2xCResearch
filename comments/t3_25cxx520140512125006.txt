I once had a man approach me in a family restaurant, telling me I should smile for him. At the time I was engaged in a very serious, very private conversation with my oldest friend concerning my dying grandmother. I was horrified.  

On the other end of the spectrum, policing emotions is sort of a classist thing, too. I was absolutely miserable at work the other day. I have two jobs so I hadn't had a day off for a long stretch. Also, I was worried about a friend with a serious illness. I try to force a pleasant expression, and sometimes it helps, but this day it was just not on... A woman came to my register to check out, made a comment about the amount she was spending. I responded with a nod. She was like, "Well, you can laugh." She was spending more than I make in two weeks on plastic flowers; I didn't know it was a joke, so I guess I just raised my eyebrows. Then she kept insisting I smile and laugh at her joke for the rest of the interaction. It was really uncomfortable. If I forced a smile I knew it would be a really mean Wednesday Addams grimace, so I just tried to remain neutral to keep the peace. She left in a huff.

The next day she returned all her expensive plastic flowers. Again, I was pleasant, not bubbly. She went off to the back of the store to complain to my manager that I was 'mean' to her. 

People telling you to smile is not about about them wanting you to be happy. It's about them wanting to be validated, or not wanting to be brought down by the idea that maybe your a person and maybe you have valid problems.
