I definitely agree that you should still protect yourself from STIs and STDs. 

There would be tests in humans if the method were profitable enough. More people need to join clinical trials and help find said trials. I already donated when I first read about it.

You'd think with the amount of taxes that go to social services every month, people might be more interested in adding another form if birth control that is quite possibly superior to many out there!
