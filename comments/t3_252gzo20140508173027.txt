Oh yes, that one's great!

Super impressive when I'm the salesperson & the waiter expects my client to pay...the extent to which I have to over-project authority to maintain credibility in those venues is absurd. (Not to mention how visibly awkward my client becomes about the restaurant staff and other guests seeing him let me pick up the check. The social judgement against my professional companions is not helpful.)

In my own town at least I have reliable options where I get the check if I order the wine for the table, totally unpredictable if I'm traveling though.
