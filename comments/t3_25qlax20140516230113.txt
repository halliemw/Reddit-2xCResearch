I worked at a natural market that carried several different sizes and brands of menstrual cups. Even got free samples of some and none work right with me. Either too big and it folds in on me and leak, too round and it irritates. One gave me a yeast infection (and I changed it often). Not to mention I am a heavy flow girl the first 2 days and I would have to get blood all over my hands to get it out, pour it down toilet, put it back in and walk to the sink from the stall with blood stained hands, hiding it from customers. Ugh! Not for me. 

I'm all about saving money, and helping the environment but it just isn't practical for me. My cervix is flipped so maybe that is the reason they don't work.
