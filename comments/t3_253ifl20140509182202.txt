Thank you for taking the time to respond! I hate to say this though, but it sounds like an awful lot of speculation on your part. Unless you studied this area academically, I don't know how reliable your take on this is. Still though, thank you. I feel bad in taking your time up in writing all of that, you didn't have to!
