I see many posts like these and they make me think back to when I made my reddit account. I looked around at the top subs and subscribed to ones I was interested in, I put forth the effort to find this place and subscribe here. It was a great community. You didn't take that time to find this sub, but I should stay for you? Why? Taking a look at your post history, you're infrequently posting. So you're a mostly observer of this sub. So I'm supposed to put up with anal rape jokes in my inbox so you can be entertained? And I'm supposed to feel bad if I leave because someone who didn't actively cultivate their reddit viewing found this place when it became easy?

I'm not trying to be mean, I'm not trying to say you should or shouldn't browse reddit in the way you want to. But there was a nice community here I participated in, now it's full of trolls and downvotes. I'm just not that sympathetic to your plight.
