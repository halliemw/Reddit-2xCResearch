Of course a world where men aren't pressured to be stoic/never show feelings would be nice, but hating women doesn't accomplish this. And I don't think anyone ignores men. Men are everywhere in the media, movies especially, and have a ton of good role models. A world with more empathy for everyone would be ideal, but this guy wasn't suffering from a lack of empathy. He had a bunch of councilors and his parents were trying to get him help. He was just too much of dick to make friends or function as a normal human. Murders don't deserve sympathy or empathy.
