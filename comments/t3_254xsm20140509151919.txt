I hope it works out that way. But I don't consider myself that squeamish and I feel kind of alienated by the to posts. Or rather, I did, which is why I posted originally. I've resolved to be a better participant in the new column and so I'm pretty much over my dejection from earlier. Is dejection a word? Lol.
