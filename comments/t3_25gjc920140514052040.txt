Just break up with him and go find a guy who will bang you on the first date. 

Then, three months later, when you find out he's been cheating on you and given you an STD you'll be able to make lots of drama filled posts. 

Think of the fun you'll have!



Guys are expected to suppress their sexual desires all the time. 

Grow the fuck up, stop whining, and stop holding people to double standards. 

Oh, and get off the front page.
