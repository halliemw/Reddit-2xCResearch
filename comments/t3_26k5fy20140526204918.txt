The word month and pregnancy don't appear once in the whole story.  It says 4/10 women age 35-44 only work part time, but it doesn't say how many men work only part time so it means nothing.  


It does say "Another study found that female physicians also tend to work an average of 4.5 fewer hours than their male colleagues."  So that means giving a woman a spot in med school over a man means 4.5 hours of patients less get help vs if a man would've gotten into med school.
