...do you know the men accompanying you? I have walked my women friends right to their front door, but I do not view this as sexist. In the society we currently live in, it seems that women face a greater number and severity of threats than do men (barring men and women in a combat zone for example) A man might be targeted for his wallet. That can be replaced. A woman might be targeted for violence or rape. This is something I am far more cognizant of. If my male friends were under similar potential threat, then I would ensure that we had safety in numbers in that case as well.
