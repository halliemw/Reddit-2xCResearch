>The guy's been harassing her for 2 years, on an off, after only dating 4 months, and seems to see nothing wrong with that.

Agreed. Even a year later when she was dating someone new, he wanted to call her to talk about their old relationship. Then, at the end of this article, he said he thinks he's gotten over their old relationship better than her because she's "clearly" hiding from it and running from it. They were together four *months.* He clearly has attachment issues. 

I didn't read the title of this post very closely, and as I read the article, I was floored when he said their relationship lasted four months. I could kind of see the point of wanting communication for closure if they'd spent 10 years of their lives together or something. Four months? She doesn't owe him anything, and it's creepy he thinks she does.
