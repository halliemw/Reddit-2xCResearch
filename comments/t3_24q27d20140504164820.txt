If G has a problem with women who have male friends,  G shouldn't date women with predominantly male friends. Women with predominantly male friends should also not date G.

I am you (replace sports with business/finance though). I would never date G beyond the first negative comment made about my friends.  I'm not giving up my friends of ten plus years for a G. Not worth it.
