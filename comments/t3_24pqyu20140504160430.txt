> Those movies are all fancy fantasies and make-believe used to sell dolls and merchandise

My husband and I spent two days at Disney World as part of our honeymoon last month and they had almost zero Frozen merch. Or Tangled or Brave or Princess and the Frog. It seems like it takes at least a year if not longer for the Disney merch machine to ramp up.

They just lost out on us fangirl/boying out and buying $1k worth of Frozen merch, lol. You'd think the time right after a movie comes out is the best time to make that available...
