went running with my friend the other day. we were running on busy streets downtown and got honked and yelled at a few times. it was kinda skeevy but we didn't do anything. it didn't really bother us and we just laughed it off. i don't mean to belittle your experience by advising you to just "not get offended" (who says that shit? wtf?), but personally i don't react at all. act like i didn't hear it. i like to think i can come up with some pretty smartass responses but when on the spot like that i often fail.
