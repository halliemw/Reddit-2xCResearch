Some of it is probably in your head, but there probably are some dudes who don't want you there because you're a girl. Why? Could be a number of reasons:

1. Single-gender environments have a different feel than co-gender environments, and the minute you walked in the office, it was no longer a boys' club. Some of your coworkers resent the change. Suddenly they can't hang posters of boobs all over their cubicles and tell Chris Brown jokes in the lunchroom (extreme examples, but you get the idea). You make them feel like they have to be on their best behavior.

2. Engineers are not known for being Don Juans. Some of these dudes are shy and the idea of talking to a reasonably attractive girl probably scares the shit out of them.

3. They're grade-A dipsticks.

None of this is your fault--many women in STEM fields deal with similar issues in the workplace. You got this internship because you're talented and you deserve it. Be polite, be great at your job, and be brave--if you have to force some dorks to interact with you to get shit done, then you get in their pimply little faces and make them.
