I just need to say something to you that might scare you, but you need to hear. Your presence in her life might be the only thing that can save her. 

I survived a lot of physical abuse growing up at the hands of my mother, some really awful stuff that hasn't left me and probably will take a lot of time to. If it weren't for my older sister expecting excellence academically from me, and expecting excellence in virtue, I wouldn't be in college. My older sister received a handsome scholarship to Yale, but she went to a private local college in our hometown just to look after me. She spent all of her science fair winnings on birthday presents for me, Easter basket candies, a string of Christmas lights that we taped into a tree on our living room wall because we had no funds for a tree. It was so hard. I fought it, I fought with her constantly because I didn't think I deserved her love. I was upset that she cared because it meant that maybe I didn't deserve what was happening to me. 

You have the power to be a light in your sister's life, and whether another person or organization has to come in to save her, it is your obligation as her older sister and as a moral human to be there for her in any way that you possibly can. You obviously care deeply for her, your writing illustrates a deep empathy for your sister and it comes across as truly beautiful. You see worth and beauty in her, and if you can try to help her see what you see, it might save her life.
