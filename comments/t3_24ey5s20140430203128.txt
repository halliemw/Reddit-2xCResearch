They're pretty long, but I do order the tall sizes. These are the ones I have and love: http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=929042002&vid=1&locale=en_US&kwid=1&sem=false&sdReferer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F and they give inseam lengths too! 

**They are large in the booty-area, which is fine for me, but depending on your body type, that might not be something you want. Reviews do say that they get baggy but I don't find that.
