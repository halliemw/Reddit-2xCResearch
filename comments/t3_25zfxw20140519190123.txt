Aww :( my mom never used tampons, so I never knew they existed until she realized what a hard time I was having with pads. She finally bought me some, but hadn't at that point yet explained where tampons actually *go.*

I didn't want to put it in my butt and I knew for damn sure it wouldn't fit in that tiny hole I pee'd out of, but I wasn't really sure where the blood was coming from since I'd never been taught there's another freakin' hole there.
