Because it's easier to use scare tactics to evoke emotion in people than actually find current research. To be fair I'm not entirely sure that journalists have been taught to properly scrutinize science papers like people who've studied any science have.

Look at that famous 10 year "women shouldn't wear bras" study. People kept citing that shit like it was the word of God, whereas someone with the most basic understanding of science research papers can tell you why you can't trust the researcher for three small reasons:

1. The sample size was too small. (Participants were all French woman between the ages 20-35)

2. The researcher never bothered looking at bra size and how that would affect the study. (If you're testing a hypothesis you should have some sort of measuring tool to know what to look for)

3. It wasn't double blind. (If you really want to test a medicine you have one placebo group and one test group, if you REALLY want to test it you make sure you don't know who is taking the medicine and who is consuming the sugar pill.)

Lastly, you re-test if you get the same results each time then it turns into a phenomenon and you have a theory.

TL;DR Journalists probably don't know how to pick apart research papers.
