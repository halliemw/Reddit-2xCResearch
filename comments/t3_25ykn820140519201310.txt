Is it going to be an all day or weekend event? If so, I think it's nice for the beginning of it to be kind of structured so people get to know each other. Sometimes, it's awkward if you're in a group and only know the bride. Maybe you can set up a wine or whisky tasting or something, or do one of those wine & canvas group events. You don't want the whole thing too structured, but something set up so people get to know each other is a good thing, especially if it's for a whole weekend.
