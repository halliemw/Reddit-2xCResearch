I've been working as a II and III tier tech for about 2 years now, and while I consider myself lucky to not face sexism at my workplace on a day-to-day basis it does exist. 

Colleagues are usually "congratulating" me and other females at the company on the International Womens day, which I find highly offensive. NO, I do not want to be congratulated on having another gender than you. YES, I just want to be seen as an equal in this society.


They're sending what they think are "witty" and "silly" e-mails, disguised in a seemingly innocent and playful way. I hate this sneaky sexism, and I do hate the open sexism. I won't stop telling my colleagues to keep their "witty" sexist jokes to themselves.
