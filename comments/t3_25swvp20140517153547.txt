None of what you said even matters. Someone's appearance is not an excuse to treat them poorly. Having a big butt doesn't mean it gets to be groped, a fat person eating a burger doesn't mean people get to yell obscenities at them, being skinny doesn't mean you get to tell them to stop being anorexic. I'll say this much: everyone judges everyone (to varying degrees, of course), and you can infer some things about people based on their behaviour or appearance with a chance of being correct but *that is unrelated to how people are treated.* If you use that crap you spewed as a justification for how people are treated, then you really are as your username suggests (an asshole).
