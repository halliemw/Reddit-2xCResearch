Gotta second the others who said Metroid. It really is a fantastic series. Just to get more specific....

I recommend the Metroid Prime Trilogy for the Wii. The point and click controls feel really natural with the Wii remote.

Super Metroid might be the best game in the series (and one of the best games of all times.) One thing I love about that game is that (unlike a lot of games today) there's basically no hand-holding, no NPCs, and no dialogue. They kind of plop you on Planet Zebes and let you figure it out. Despite having no dialogue, it manages to tell a great story.

Fun bit of trivia: Early in Super Metroid, you go down a long vertical drop then go right into a room with a bunch of broken glass tubes. It turns out this is where you fought the final boss in the first Metroid game. So the worlds overlap. Not only that, but [Spoiler](/s "After you defeat Mother Brain in Super Metroid, the planet is set to self destruct and you have a time limit to escape. Eventually, you blast open a new path and end up at the same vertical climb to the surface, where you get to your ship. As an homage to the first Metroid, the escape routes from planet Zebes overlap between the 2 games.... I really love this series!")
