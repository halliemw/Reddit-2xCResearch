You owe a lot of that to the Republican Party too. The Republican party wrote and passed the 19th amendment. If it's your position that feminism hasn't changed and evolved over the years, then neither has the republican party. Oh wait, they both have.

I didn't cherry pick anything. I simply googled "quotes from feminist leaders" and got that on the first page and the title didn't even have "radical" in it.

The movement has discredited itself.

Feminism focuses on women's rights, yes. But it doesn't focus on equal rights for women. It focuses on increasing rights for women, often at the expense of others. 

It is feminism that makes people call the police when I'm sitting at a playground taking pictures of my daughter going down the slide. 

It's feminism that makes airlines move male passengers if they are sitting next to an unattended minor. 

It's feminism that says if I get drunk and have sex with a drunk woman that I raped her.

It's feminism that says women never make false rape reports, and if they do we shouldn't punish women for ruining a man's life. 

It's feminism that focuses society's efforts towards helping homeless women more than men even though women only account for 1/6 of the homeless population. 

It's feminism that mocks men who have been abused by women and speak up about it -- just look for a shelter for men who have been abused. 

It's feminism that says a woman can end her pregnancy if she didn't mean to get pregnant, but a man has no choice in paying child support. 

It's feminism that says I can be forced to pay for child support of someone else's kid if my wife has an affair and I only find out later.

No. Feminism is a malignant movement. It is a cancer to those who truly want equal rights for everyone.
