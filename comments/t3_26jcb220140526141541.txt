>OPTION 3: We here on TwoX have a history of trusting each other. I see women offering rides, couches and beds to other women all the time. We're a fantastic community (with or without the influx of people from r/all). Should we begin by talking to the mods and making it Reddit-based? Maybe the mods could keep a list in the sidebar of users who are willing to be contacted and their general regions? (This could be a problem with us being a default now. Maybe we should make a separate sub for this?)

Even before being a default we wouldn't be able to support this, I'm sorry, it's a great idea but inherently unsafe both for the users offering rides and those looking for them to rely on an anonymous forum. We've always had trolls here and always have had to be aware that not everyone was posting here in good faith.

Keeping lists easily found by nefarious people of our users and their locations isn't something I wouldn't feel good about, we can't vet people any more than regular users and I wouldn't feel comfortable saying with certainty that specific people are "safe". 

Your option 1 of an off-reddit site sounds the most promising if you and others are willing to do their due diligence of making sure pro-life extremists (or worse!) aren't abusing the system. From both directions, the people looking for rides could be looking for trouble as well. Before sending people there we would have to be convinced of your methods though. It's a pretty scary/big thing your attempting to promise. I'm sorry if I sound discouraging, but anonymous people on the internet aren't always the most trustworthy.
