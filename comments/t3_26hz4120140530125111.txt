I was told that most people recover from the surgery within a few days and are able to do normal activities the next day. Not to scare you off having the surgery as you may very well be one of the majority, but I ended up having complications and took a while to recover. I had the original surgery on the 9th and a second one on the 15th of this month.

My Gartner's Duct Cyst had ended up being larger than my doctor anticipated. She ended up marsupializing it so that it could drain. She was unable to remove the entire cyst due to its proximity to my uterus and the blood vessels & artery that go to the uterus. I ended up having to have the surgery twice as part of the cyst had closed off (it was supposed to stay open, but I think my body hates me) and was growing in size due to fluid and blood gathering in the closed off portion.

I went to see her on the 15th because I was still experiencing pain (like someone was pinching me very hard). She got me in the hospital that evening and scraped out the cyst and removed more of the cyst wall. The recovery from this second surgery was much much better than the first. I suspect that the recovery I had with the second surgery is more akin to what most people experience.
