I recommend the book "NonViolent Communication" for sticky situations. It's a how-to for dealing with uncomfortable situations without escalating negative emotions. For example, speaking neutrally about it. I love this book dearly. 

Here is a basic primer: http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/aboutnvc/4partprocess.htm

1. Observation without judgment. Describing the behavior. 
2. Name the emotion. State what it is evoking in you, or guess what the other person is feeling and ask them. http://www.cnvc.org/Training/feelings-inventory
3. State the need connected to that emotion, or guess the need of the other person and ask. http://www.cnvc.org/Training/needs-inventory
4. Request a concrete and positive action. This is not a demand. 

For example: over the past X months it looks like you're physically able to work, but I have only seen you look for jobs Y number of times. I feel frustrated because I am anxious about our financial situation. Would you be willing to look for Z number of jobs per week?

I love this book. I mostly reserve the 4 parts for difficult issues or sensitive topics.
