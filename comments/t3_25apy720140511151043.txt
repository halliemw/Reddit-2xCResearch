I'll usually wait for a while after I sense I have to go. But I won't say "I have to go pee" until I'm going to go pee.

I feel like I have an early warning system. If I go when I first get the urge it's usually a smaller amount - basically not even worth the trip to the bathroom (especially if there's a line involved).

I have given thought to why women seem to need to go more frequently than men. My guess is because their reproductive system is more outside, while ours takes up more space on our insides. So I guess things like our bladder are more squished than theirs - that's my totally non-scientific guess.
