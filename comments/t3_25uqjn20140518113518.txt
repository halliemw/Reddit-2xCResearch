> Are you at someone's job and are they working right now? Then it's gross and embarrassing. 

Not always. Even so, a compliment is not gross and embarrassing (well, except if it's catcalling, but that's not what we're talking about). Don't be so fragile.

I've been hit on at my workplace by people I didn't think interesting/attractive in the slightest, so? I work in a hotel, so it actually happens a lot. If it's a compliment, I thank them, and ignore it. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's only if they don't get that clue that it becomes awkward.
