Do you have much of a support network?  Friends, family?  How open are you with this guy about the hang ups you are having about the relationship?  It might be good to tell him you feel like the other woman, you know just open up and be frank.  

Also you say you are seeing a shrink.  This should be a good place to explore your thoughts and feelings. How long have you been in therapy?
