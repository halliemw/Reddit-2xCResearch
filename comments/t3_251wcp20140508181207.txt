I agree with everything you said and gggreg vs gggina has always been a huge source of annoyance for me on reddit. Especially since there really isn't an opposite to gggina (since gggreg is pretty gender neutral) and if there was it would never get up voted.

Like, you would never see a gggreg that said something like, "had shitty day at work, bf eats me out to help relax" on the front page (and not just because my example was horribly uncreative).
