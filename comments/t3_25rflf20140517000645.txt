I was just playing around with my hair a few months ago, complaining about the maintenance on waist-length hair, and that I was looking at short hair cuts. He made a face and said he really wanted me to keep it long. Guess who got a pixie cut?

That aside, practice your reaction next time he says that. Tell him that you dress how you like. It's nice to know what he thinks, but you dress for you, not for anyone else, and your daily style won't change. Style is a reflection of self, and you are just not comfortable, attracted to, or into what he is wanting you to wear. Being uncomfortable in your style can destroy your confidence in social situations. I'm sure he doesn't want that.

Practicing your reaction and your speech -- really visualizing the whole exchange -- will help you to calmly explain that his comments on your style are not welcome. Bottling it up isn't good, but neither is raging out over something that's been discussed many times before.
