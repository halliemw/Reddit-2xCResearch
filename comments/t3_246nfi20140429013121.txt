Well, the guidelines about seeing a gyno in the first place are changing, so I wouldn't worry too much about being bad or good at it. Growing up, the rule in the US was "see a gyno at 18 or when sexually active". Now it's 21 to see a gyno etc. Anyway, if you have a lady issue, it's good to have a reliable gyno to see! Hope you get it all figured out :)
