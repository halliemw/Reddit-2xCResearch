Just be yourself. You shouldn't have to change who you are or how you act for anyone. If some guy thinks you're a bitch for rejecting him that is completely not your problem, especially if you've been direct about the topic of a romantic relationship. 

Everyone is looking for different types of relationships at different points in their lives so awkward situations can happen sometimes. Some guys might handle the rejection just fine and be able to continue to be your friend and others won't. That is their choice just like deciding whether or not you are attracted to them and want to pursue something more is your choice. The biggest takeaway is just to be strong in your convictions and don't take whatever the outcome of the situation is personally.
