I also identify as a feminist. I am 37, and have known feminists who got involved starting in the 1950's and feminist who are still in their teens. All of them would agree with you that gender roles can hurt anyone. 

I don't believe that feminism and MRAs are currently compatible. The reason for this being that feminism is an established philosophy that has existed for more than a hundered years, and has a rich academic history. MRAs are a pretty new group that exsists almost exclusively on the Internet, and spend most of their time and energy hating feminism and claiming that it is the worst thing ever. I've never seen a men's rights advocate actually advocating anything anywhere but on the Internet, and even then, they are usually just advocating that feminism is the worst thing in the world.
