I, like others that have posted, grew up in the South.  Down south, you are taught **manners** growing up - at least manners USED to be taught:

Respect your elders

Say "ma'am" and "sir,"

Open/hold doors for people (notice I said PEOPLE)

Say "thank you" and "you're welcome."

These are off the top of my head; I'm sure there's a lot more.

As far as the use of "Miss" - I was taught to use the term "Miss" when you are speaking to a female and using her first name - Miss Sandy, Miss Emma, etc."  "Yes ma'am" or "Yes sir" was used, basically, instead of "okay" or "yes/no":

"Bigbabysurfer, did you do your homework today?"  "Yes, sir."

"Bigbabysurfer, please take out the trash."  "Yes, ma'am."

As a child, I was taught to hold the door open for ADULTS.  That meant either sex.  YOU HOLD THE FREAKING DOOR OPEN.
