I'm under the impression that your body adjusts and the device gives off more hormone for the first little while, but eventually it settles out and the amount of hormone in your system (which can be measured by a peripheral blood test) is basically nil. The device releases about 20 micrograms of progesterone/day, compared to 3000 micrograms of a progestin and 20 micrograms of synthetic estradiol in YAZ.
