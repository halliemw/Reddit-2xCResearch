People like that just drag you down. I had a friend that sounded a lot like your bf. Guess why his gf dumped him? Because he was a total fucking buzz kill and whined constantly about his problems but never tried to fix them. Whenever anyone called him out on his bullshit he'd just get butthurt and pout. Your bf sounds immature and it seems like you've outgrown him and the relationship.
