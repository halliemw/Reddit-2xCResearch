I got invited to a wedding shower and a wedding, got all the registration cards of where to buy gifts from, but with no reception invite this year. It was also for someone I wasn't particularly close to, so while frowned upon in the Miss Manners world it does happen. When that happened, (she specially sent me an extra facebook message just to get my address again so she could invite me and I felt so honored at first) I ended up just not going. Maybe I was rude back, but I was busy with school at the time and I didn't want to get invited to the gift-giving and sitting in a church (generally free to let people into the church once you get a church wedding) but not any of the guest stuff. And I also hadn't talked to her in 3 or 4 years and we never were that close. I didn't chew her out, I just let it go.

 I guess you can ask her whether you were invited to the wedding or not, that's the easy way to start. But if it turns out your suspicions are right, yeah, I see where you're coming from. I get that weddings are expensive, but you can't beg for gifts and not give the guests anything in return. Especially when you try to do a weird in-group out-group thing where you make everyone feel included, if you do it wrong you're just going to make the people who are "partially included" feel worse.
