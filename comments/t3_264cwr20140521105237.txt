Abusive relationships usually survive because the abuser has some qualities the victim believes they can't live without. That can range from being extremely apologetic, buying gifts, and making amends sweetly and sincerely after each time there is violence or abuse, or just being sole financial provider, or a whole range of other things. The point is that the person can unfortunately feel that those things are so meaningful, the "truth" of the relationship, and that the bad parts will go away or just be ignored/avoided/survived as best as possible.

I'm not saying you're in an abusive relationship or anything, I just wanted to point out that having great qualities doesn't just cancel out shitty ones. And in the worst cases, they can be used to justify the shiftiness.

Your boyfriend sounds like a bit of a jerk, and so even if he has lots of great qualities, you should know that lots of men have great qualities without being rude or dismissive or joking about women being inferior to men, and so on.

Also, do you do things like that to him? If not, maybe think about why you deserve to be treated with the same respect and consideration that you are willing and able to give to others. :)
