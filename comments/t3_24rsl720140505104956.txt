I'll second that.

Hollywood makes it seem like a big deal, writing whole movies about it, because that's what sells. Really, it's like really needing a cigarette or to take a shit (ok, probably not the best analogies) and finally getting to do it. You want the orgasm, you finally get it, weeee!

I've been in both relationships with and without sex, and the ones without sex and inherintly less complicated too. Just takes a lot more willpower.
