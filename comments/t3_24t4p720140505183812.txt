>Doctors may not care how much you exercise or how well you eat, because being fat is the major risk factor for a whole variety of illnesses.

Exactly. And there's a good reason that doctors may not ask about exercise or eating habits-- [studies show](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454084) that most of time, obese patients vastly underestimate the amount of calories they are eating and overestimate the amount of exercise they do.
