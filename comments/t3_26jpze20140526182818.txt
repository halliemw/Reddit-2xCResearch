I have a cluster of three benign cysts in my right breast. My ex found the lump, and I was terrified when I finally went to the doctor to get it checked out. Turns out they're common and nothing to worry about. I don't worry about them anymore. 

That said, go to a doctor and get an ultrasound done to find out what it is for sure. It's scary, yes, but you will know what to do, if you have to do anything, once you know what it is.
