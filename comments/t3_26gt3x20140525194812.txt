Yep. I had a friend who would sometimes go psycho-bitch on her boyfriend, and the best thing that could have happened was him calling the cops on her. An arrest, anger management classes, and therapy were the hard way, but if someone resists getting help on their own, what can you do? It's not OK to hit people.
