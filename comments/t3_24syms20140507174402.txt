This might be a good place to start educating yourself about feminism:

I suspect that part of the problem (as has been pointed out before) is that the term "feminism" sounds like it means "pro-female", which one could potentially infer as therefore meaning "anti-male" as well.  Men and women alike who misunderstand the term can then say, "I'm not a feminist, because both men AND women are great.  Feminists shouldn't blame men for all the problems in the world!"  And that's not what it is: fighting against a male-dominated society doesn't mean fighting against men.  It doesn't mean choosing a side.  Feminism is pro gender equality.  Feminists are fighting deeply rooted biases in the minds of both men and women.
