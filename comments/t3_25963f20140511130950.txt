In the context, she says the other person attributes it to her femininity. If she's doing it when OP gets excited when they're hanging out with dudes, and she's not just when she gets upset, it means she doesn't like it when OP is happy and exuberant. The most likely reason for not liking that is people tend to respond well to someone smiling or being very happy - which means OP is probably getting positive responses from the guys she's with when she gets stoked about something. Some women are very jealous about male attention (note: some, not all or even most) and it's the most likely explanation why she doesn't like OP being loud about being happy. 

And as for the first bit, "calm down" to me always reads as "I find your feelings bothersome please stop having them" and usually it's because the person doesn't want to deal with them because they don't want to deal with you as a human being instead of a NPC filling a role. Which is why it's so enraging because they're devaluing part of what makes you a person and makes you dynamic. It's dismissive and doesn't deal with whatever has made you pissed off. 

And, frankly, I've noticed women get told to calm down or that they're being overly emotional more then men do. When men show emotion it's deep and meaningful. When women do they're being catty or annoying or trying to get attention. (Note, I mean this as a general trend and it does not apply to every case ever in the history of forever, just what I have noticed happens most of the time when someone gets told to calm down)
