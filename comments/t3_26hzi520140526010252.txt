I would not buy a taser for this reason. Tasers are best for the police to restrain someone who is resisting arrest but basically not moving, like a big muscly drunk dude. If you miss with a taser, you are fucked, and a self-defense situation is stressful and fast-paced. Compared to pepper spray, stun guns are bulky and expensive but are difficult to overpower. I would recommend keeping pepper spray on your keychain and taking a taser in your purse. The reality is that at some point you may get tired of carrying around a stun gun or you may not have your purse, and pepper spray is certainly better than nothing.
