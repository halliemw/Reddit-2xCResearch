I can understand the reasoning you hold, reddit needs to show new users different areas of reddit to encourage growth and diversity. The issue to me is not the assholes and the trolls who already exist and are quickly dealt with, but rather that this place is meant to be a safe environment for ladies to share their problems without fear of being judged by men. This subreddit is one of the few places on reddit where that can happen on a large scale.

Asides from the trolls, before becoming a default the only people here are the ones who have searched for such an environment to have discussion from a female perspective, as the sidebar suggests. It won't happen overnight, but on average 7,000 people create a reddit account every day and I would imagine very few of these new users read the sidebar for all fifty defaults, or even pay attention to what each subreddit actually is.
