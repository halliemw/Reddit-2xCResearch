I understand the point of the toys, I'm worried that the functionality of the toy's design is missing the point. I'd feel better about the toy if the emphasis was on action (Flappable wings, karate-chop motions, voice boxes etc) , instead of on the boots, capes, gloves, and other accessories that look to be interchangeable.
