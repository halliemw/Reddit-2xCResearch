The high school I went to had a dress code. It was... really not the big deal it's made out to be online. Skirts had to be "fingertip length", no spaghetti straps, no obscene language printed on shirts, etc. It was practical and nobody made a fuss. It was enforced evenly across the board- I remember a few guys being made to change their shirts for the strap rule.
