If I were you, I would try to back out of the bridesmaid obligation. Your friend is getting lost in her fantasy. You have a new job. 

You can totally back out, you just have to do it delicately. "Friend, I really want to be a part of your wedding, but I just don't have the time or resources right now to commit to being one of your bridesmaids. If there's anything else I can do to help out, like I'll help plan, let me know. Thanks."

I'm saying this from real life - my experience being a bridesmaid at my best friend's wedding completely ruined my relationship with her. And we had been bffs since 12/13, and the wedding was ten years later. It was horrible, and involved the same kinda stuff like money and dismissal of my feelings. This was four or years ago and I'm still sad over.
