The thing is, she doesn't know my father and I know. Its not that we have a bad relationship, its just that she's shy and probably scared of what we'll think or do; the males in my family are notoriously loud and sarcastic. She broke up with her boyfriend when my mom told my dad; I also feel like its not my place to deal with the situation as a parent since I am not one. 

She does plays at the playhouse and my mom has done a good job of keeping her interested in non-school related extra curricular activities. 

Edit: also, my parents have a very weird and hands off way of parenting. While they enforce some social media privacy they will not dictate what she can or cannot post and they do not force her to friend or defriend certain people. I'm sure this has been suggested many times though.
