Oh man, I know the feeling of continually adding to my cosplay to-do list! It's so hard to stop coming up with great ideas, especially if you have friends to cosplay with. I've been planning a bunch of couples cosplays now because I have a good friend who is an excellent crossplayer, haha. It's too much fun! 

If you're in California, you should come to AX, it's the biggest/best for cosplay.
