A woman's virginity is worth nothing, save the sentimental value she attaches to it.

If you find it valuable, and find some joy in knowing you have it, then that's just swell.  It has the same value to you as a stamp collector's favorite page of stamps.

If you don't care about it though?  Then what the heck is the point of hanging onto it?  When I'm 80, I'm sure as heck not going to be looking back and wishing I hadn't had more sex.

Your mom needs to get over herself.  Please don't change who you are for her preferences.  You've been granted a life of your own. It's a wonderful gift!  Don't waste it by letting your mom live both hers and yours.  She's got her own life to lead.  That's her gift from the world.  She's trying to be greedy by having more than one.  

Don't let her!

You are your own person, not an extension of your mother.  And God DEFINITELY isn't punishing you for not showing blind obedience to your mom.  It's troubling to hear her take the lord's name in vain in that regard.  I'm not religious but even I know.  

She should absolutely know better!  This is a direct violation of the third commandment!  She is literally taking the lord's name and using it for her own vanity, equating God's goals with her own!  Indefensible for anyone who is a true believer!

Your mom has her own hypocrasies to worry about, just like any person.  Don't let her talk down to you from the pulpit.  You are an adult now with just as valid an opinion on any matter as she has.  Act like it, stand up for yourself, and don't be surprised when she lashes out from seeing her position challenged.

This rebellion is important though.  Just like cellular mitosis, you've got to distinguish yourself as an individual entity before you can lead your own life.
