I dunno. I think different people are wired differently. You could read up on limerence, which is obsessive romantic infatuation. It's clear to me that some people are wired for limerence, some are wired for normal crushes and some are wired for progressive love through familiarity. Likewise, some people are asexual and/or aromantic.
