Alternately if there's a wedding specific vendor (like a photographer who specializes in weddings) you reeeally want to work with, it's okay to tell them you're on a tight budget and ask what they can do. At worst they just say no, at best they give you a cool-bride discount or point you in the direction of someone similar who's in your price range. 

For example, I hooked up with an AMAZING indie photographer for cheap because she was just starting her business and she thought my low budget, low-fi colorful wedding concept was neat.
