Thank you for your reply, but I do think that I may have presented information in a misleading way if this is your conclusion.  It is more that he is an introvert and is disinterested in going out of his comfort zone. He doesn't have a restricted range of emotional expression at all, which I know is another symptom of schizoid personality disorder, so I don't think your diagnosis applies.

I am a mental health practitioner and have gotten a ton of shit on reddit for jumping to conclusions about people's mental health.  I'm not trying to do this here...thanks for taking the time to reply and all, I just respectfully disagree.
