I personally love the fit and size availability of Cleo by panache swimsuits, but a lot of other options are out there. You can buy some of these from breakout bras or other online stores, since most department stores don't carry sizes like that. But I would definitely recommend a bra sized swimsuit with underwire for the best support and comfort.

Unfortunately, these are all more expensive than department store suits. But they're also really well made.
