Not really depressing, realistic, you mentioned yourself you thought he wanted the break to release pressure from commitment. And I am not sure quite how to put this..... maybe he is not that someone you have been waiting for all your life, maybe this is a bit of wishful thinking. Surely you did not wait all your life to be treated as an after though or a second choice?
