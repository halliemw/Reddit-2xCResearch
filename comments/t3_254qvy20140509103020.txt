The entire situation is uncomfortable. It sounds like supervisor is unclear on where the line is. It doesn't sound like anyone is trying to get him fired, you're just attempting to establish a work environment that is comfortable. Unfortunately. in this case, you have to power through making your supervisor very *un*comfortable before everyone can reach that point. I know it sucks, but you did the right thing - that's why other women are rallying behind you! Maybe approaching him first would have been better; but then again, since he had a complaint lodged 4 years ago and has yet to change his tune, maybe not. Regardless, his behavior before and his behavior right now is highly unprofessional. Remember to stick to your guns, and keep calm. I'm rooting for you!
