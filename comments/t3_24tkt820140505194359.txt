Me and my boyfriend are both kind of this person, on and off. We have periods of introversion. When I got out with his friends he accuses me of being bored, when really I'm just not super outgoing but I did have fun. I  sometimes accuse him of being totally ambivalent about going out and doing things, because he will just leave all the decisions up to me and I wish he would stake a claim. It's really not that I'm forcing him to come out, he just says he's happy to do anything I want to do. We're both indecisive. 

I think the key here is just compromise. Talk to him about it, and literally set schedules: on x night, you get to plan a date for us, etc.
