Serious question: I'm a male sexually attracted to women, as in I am aroused and masturbate to porn and my imagination and stuff. So I guess that makes me hetero-normative cis-gendered, right?

But. I have never had sex, or would consider having sex, with a woman I wasn't in a committed (read: exclusive, not necessarily long term) relationship with. Does that have a special designation or anything? Or is it just 'normal', for lack of a better word in my lexicon?

This may not be the best time or place to ask this question, and I'm sorry if I'm derailing the thread/topic. If I offend, please tell me and point me in the right direction where I can get some clarity.
