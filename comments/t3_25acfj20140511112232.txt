Workaholic mother I rarely saw as I was growing up and an alcoholic father I had to babysit from the time I was 9. I feel ya. I only realize how much I don't feel a bond with my parents when Mother's Day and Father's Day come around and everyone is talking about how amazing their parents are on facebook.
