Awesome! Glad to see more ladies riding! And wow you bought the bike on the left for new? It looks beautiful.

I have a Ninja 2007 250R and am currently having trouble figuring out what I want to do with it. I recently moved to an apartment and wouldn't feel comfortable leaving it out in the parking lot all the time, so right now it's at home in my parent's garage. I'm worried I won't end up riding it much this year given that I have to drive 30 mins home to ride it if I ever want to :(
