There's a whole lot of appropriating experiences of subsets of women under blanket terms like misogyny and rape culture without recognizing that there's a lot of different and nuance. Slut shaming is still an issue for women, but its not clearly defined within or by misogyny since it doesn't necessarily effect all women directly but the indirect issues of how society views sex and sexuality effect just about everybody.
