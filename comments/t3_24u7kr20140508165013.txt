I should add that if anyone wants to look this up that searching for "cervical mucus plug" you will probably have results about pregnancy. A human anatomy or a guide to the [menstrual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle) or [reproductive process](http://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/pregnancy/conception/human-reproduction7.htm) is probably going to be a better choice for finding more information.
