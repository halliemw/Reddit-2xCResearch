Is it possible to put up some kind of document outlining how to go about dealing with harassment? I've checked the FAQ, rules, wiki, user agreement, and privacy policy and nothing mentions how to go about reporting it. I think it would help a lot of people who are feeling frustrated at what seems like a lack of action on the part of the admins because they don't really know what happens when they press the report button on a PM and how to follow up with a message over at /r/reddit.com.

I've been here for quite a while now and I had no idea that /r/reddit.com was even functional still.
