There's also the idea they have, of funding a bus ride and a stay in a nearby hotel. It takes out the fear of staying with a stranger/having a stranger come stay with you, and the people that run the site could make the reservations, with proof of an appointment (is that possible? I don't know, but you'll need to weed out people thinking they can use it for a free mini vacation).

I do like prefer the idea of crashing on someone's couch and having them there for a ride just for the moral support, but the internet IS a scary place and abortion is such a hot topic that it's really hard to be 100% sure of someone. I have a totally clean background, nothing pops up, but what if I'm pro-life and decide to take a girl elsewhere, or just try to talk her out of it?
