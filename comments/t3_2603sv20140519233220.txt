Disposable razors are fine, but I would suggest using something better than a Bic. You need something that can curve with your body. I like the Venus razors, which are also made in disposable form. (Although I'm sure there are other generics as well.) I would suggest using a shaving agent (shaving cream, shampoo, whatever works best for you) and rinse often. 

I also have embarrassing hair, and razors have been the best solution for me, personally.
