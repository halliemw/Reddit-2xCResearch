What turned me from a couch-potato to someone who's fairly physically fit?

Competitive sports. Specifically, roller derby.

In late summer-fall of 2009, I did a whole couch-to-5k program, in preparation for a 5k that fall. It was hard work, but somehow I stuck with it, and completed the 5k without walking - though barely.

Spring of 2010, from a desire to just try something new, I found a beginner group for learning the basics of roller derby. I could skate without holding on to the wall, which was enough to get started. It was so much fun that I was able to push through the sore muscles and 2 hours of skating twice a week, and even started doing 1-2 nights of open skate a week during it. By summer, I had signed up for the local league's summer 6-week skating camp. Come fall, I tried out for the league and made it.

But the league required 3 practices a week, minimum. 2 hour practices, all which were tougher than anything I had done yet. I'd often do four, as I needed it to learn, and now had more incentive for the gym.

I just finished my fourth season. Four years of 3+/week practices, gym workouts, and so on. I've done personal training sessions after running a 5k as a warmup. 

All it took was making the exercise part of and necessary for something I really enjoyed. And that I had made a commitment to my 15+ coaches and teammates that I would make my required practices and improve my skills so that I could play and be effective. It's surprising what you can make yourself do when a group of people you love and respect are counting on you and returning the favor.
