English language doesn't have one. I use "he", because in Russian (which has 3 grammatical genders), the "neutral" version of adjectives, for example, is, by convention, masculine. And so this was a habit I transferred into English, I suppose.

"They" is used more and more commonly though. The other thing I sometimes use is "(s)he," but for possessive pronouns, it doesn't work.
