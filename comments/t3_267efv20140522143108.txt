>It's a bummer when people think that we're under more responsibility to not react to terrible behavior than others are to not act that way.

oh my god, this. I feel like that's a huge part of the problem. "Well people are assholes so you just have to deal with it and move on..." Why can't the onus be on the assholes, not on the people who have to deal with it? If people could just not be enormous douchecanoes in the first place...

edit - oh wow, I just got my first "dumb feminist slut" pm. I feel like I've finally arrived!
