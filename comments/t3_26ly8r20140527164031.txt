> It saddens me that this is just some 'rapist, meth head' who should just have his life ended, to you. That man was a human being. A sick human being. Suffering from substance abuse and probably mental health issues.

It saddens me that you didn't bother to actually read what I wrote, and instead interpreted it in a way that supports your own agenda.

I wrote that I do not ever want to kill anyone. I do not ever want to have to use my gun. The only situation in which I would do so is one in which my life is at risk, and yes, in that situation, I will decide that my life is worth more than that of the person attacking me. **There are plenty of addicts and people suffering from mental health issues who do not try to rape and kill other people.** Yes, you are right that many people need better access to better care, but that doesn't mean I should have to allow someone to rape or kill me. Sick human being or not, if someone tries to rape or kill me, I will not hesitate to defend myself, with lethal force if necessary. You give up your right to live the second you decide to try to take away my right to live.

To phrase it succinctly, **why, in your view, is my rapist's right to live more important than my right to not be raped?**

> I can't believe you live in a society, so fearful of it's own shadow, that you must carry deadly weapons at all times. 

You're welcome to think whatever you'd like, but I can tell you that if I were the first person Elliot Rodger attacked, I would still be here to write this reply and he would not have gone on to kill several other people. 

I don't live a life of fear at all. I enjoy meeting new people and often have wonderful interactions with strangers. I *do* live a life of preparedness.
