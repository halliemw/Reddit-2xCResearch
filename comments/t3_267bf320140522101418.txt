It's not really the same thing. The Men's Rights Movement is an anti-feminist group. That's not a cherry picked example, it's one of the defining features of the movement. If you look at the [history of the MRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_rights_movement), it was started in the 70s by splitting off of the men's movement because of anti-feminism. Pretty much every prominent MRA is an anti-feminist. If you look a [poll of MensRights subreddit](http://imgur.com/a/2tjQL), it shows that 92% of them think feminism is not helpful or is hypocritical, and that's one of the largest MRA communities out there.
