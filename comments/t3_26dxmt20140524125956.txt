Even when I was still on the pill, I tried using condoms as often as possible. 

But let me be honest with you...I was really REALLY bad at remembering to take my pill at the same time everyday...and it worried me. A couple years ago, I stopped taking the pill and switched to condoms.

But I hated it. In those years, there were two accidents with torn condoms. Two accidents too many. Morning after pills and months of worrying did not do me any good. 

I actually have the birth control implant...the one in your arm. Nexplanon. I LOVE it. Not only do I not feel as emotionally fragile as I did back when I was on the pill, but I don't have to remember ANYTHING. It's just in my arm, and can stay as long as I want it to up to three years. It was one payment, and my insurance actually covered most of it! And the procedure was completely painless. The only pain was that my arm was sore for a couple days. I can't even see a scar now.
