The definition of obscene is also rather cloudy.  And I would love to hear their rationale for banning obscene content, but not hate content?

edit: And oddly enough, Facebook's own terms and conditions include "You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence."  So Facebook isn't even applying their own policies in consistent ways.

Moreover, their community standards page expressly states that facebook does not permit hate speech. Whereas, their policy on nudity and pornography, other than banning child porn, states "We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect peopleâ€™s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding."

So, to sum up, Facebook does not apply their own policies consistently, and seems to take action when content is arguably not even obscene, but won't apply their policies when it comes to clear hate speech.

So, to summarize, Facebook is full of shit.
