I would recommend seeing one and beginning to establish a relationship with them. You're young enough that statistically you should be healthy, especially with only one partner, but you want to get into a position where if anything happens, you have someone you trust to help you deal with it. That could be anything from pregnancy to cancer to minor injuries or infections. It's also good to get a baseline idea of what your blood pressure, cholesterol, liver enzymes, and so on are doing, because getting a more long-term look at it can help doctors treat the things that tend to come up as people age more effectively. 

I saw that you don't want a Pap smear, and that's ok. I'm not going to try to pressure you into it, because you're young and pretty low-risk anyway. That said, getting comfortable enough with a doctor that you would allow them to do a pelvic exam or Pap smear is a very good idea because several conditions require them to give you an exam, and it would be better if you don't ever have to choose between being in a very emotionally distressful position and a physically dangerous one. As you get older, your risk of things like fibroids will increase, so it will eventually become important that you are able to allow doctors to do what they need to do. You have time before that becomes a real concern, and I would encourage you to use it to become more comfortable with doctors and especially with a good GP who is respectful of your rights as a patient.
