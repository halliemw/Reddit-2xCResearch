You are so right, Some people just don't care. When I was waitressing some people will just disregard everything. 

Some guy continuously asked me out (happens a lot as a bartender), when I told him I had a boyfriend, he persisted, when I told him I leaving the country in 2 days to move to the other side of the world to be with my boyfriend, he persisted, when he grabbed my left hand and said "none of that matters, there isn't a ring on your finger" I had the manager ask him to leave.
