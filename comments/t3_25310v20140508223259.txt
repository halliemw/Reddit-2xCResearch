Exactly this.

I don't wear makeup. I don't like how it feels on my face, I hate the mess, I hate the time it takes to do it right, and I think I look just fine without it. (Actually, I think I look weird with makeup on, like a clown or something, even when it's been professionally done.) I'm just not a makeup person.

So I would feel really uncomfortable having this as part of the orientation for women, and it would actually make me rethink my employment there - that makeup was part of the unwritten dress code.
