Just a random look at the front page of that subreddit here are the topics of each thread from top to bottom:

- Don't be angry at women, they aren't to be hated

- Guy's gf cheats on him, regrets it, tries to please him with sex to get back with him. He uses her for sex for a while before cutting her out of his life. I'm not saying this is good but there isn't a hint of turning a no into a yes. She offered sex to him to make up for her cheating, all consensual if a bit fucked up

- A post literally saying what I am: "Definitely do not equate learning the tools to earn a girl's affection (from TRP or elsewhere) with believing you are inherently entitled to it. These are absolute opposites that are somehow being treated as identical in the media"

- A post discussing how that reddit front page post "TIL that the happiest marriages are those where the wife is able to calm down quickly after arguments" has generated no controversy, yet if it was posted on TRP it would be seen as an example of yet another disgusting red pill post

- Tips to maximise your social value

- The title of the next one is "Manipulating women in the age of social media". At first glance this seems to support you but reading the post all it says is that to manipulate women to sleep with you you have to dress well, get her friends to like you, and have an interesting image. A poorly chosen title, but if their version of manipulating women is to dress well then that's hardly a problem, no?

I'm getting bored of this now but I can literally go down the whole front page and there is zero trace of what you are complaining about.

Do I support TRP? No. Do I think it deserves its reputation as a community that says men are entitled to women's bodies? Read my summaries and go on the subreddit and read a few posts. It is a subreddit dedicated to working out what women want and how to fulfill that. The problem with it is that they have reached oversimplified and disrespectful conclusions of what women want through anecdotal evidence with a clear bias (i.e. only men who have been very hurt by rejection will go on that subreddit, reinforcing each others flawed ideas, and their new tactics will only work on the worst kind of women, and this feedback loop goes round and round to give them this very sucky worldview of women....however this is the same thing that has happened to THIS subreddit. eg this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26ki7i/being_on_this_site_has_made_me_really_wary_of_men/)
