Actually, it does not 'prove' anything. I skimmed through it but i did not see any links to and scientific or medical confirmation, studies, journals or papers. An article like that has no weight on its own.

Regardless, the article actually confirms that men and women are vastly different in what they like and dislike.

As well as confirming physical differences, which should be obvious to anyone.

And it even states that the 'stereotypes' (such as men liking things like maths and science more than females and women liking things such as scrapbooking (whatever the hell that is), emotion-based jobs etc more than males, for example) are mostly true.

The only things it states regarding men and women been more similar than previously thought is in relation to sex, relationships etc etc.

Stop trying to make out as if this is shooting down my argument. It isnt. In fact, it is *helping* my argument by confirming my points about men and women being vastly different mentally and physically.
