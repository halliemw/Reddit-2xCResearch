>Can I do this?

Meaning... Is it possible? Definitely! I don't know if I can be of any more use in figuring out what that would look like for you... But if you have any questions concerning that I'd be glad to do whatever I can.

Or did you mean something more like... "Am I willing to try this?" That's something only you can answer, but of course you know that!

Patience. It seems to me there are a LOT of major decisions wrapped up in your situation. If there's any time to *not* be hasty, it's now! You will have a wonderful and unique story to tell one day. Don't miss out on today! Which, I realize is easier said than done. :)
