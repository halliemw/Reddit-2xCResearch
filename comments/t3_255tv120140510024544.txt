I'm sorry, but what the FUCK?!  How is asking someone how many times they were kicked by an abusive partner in a specific beating going to achieve much in the courtroom - especially when they expect an exact and accurate answer.
Jesus Christ!  When someone is scared for the personal safety or possibly their life, when they are in pain, when they are on the floor, being completely dominated how are they supposed to remember exact details from something as traumatic as that!?

And that psychologist?  Doesn't appear to understand domestic violence, AT ALL.  Or relationships for that matter.  Needs to be fired and get a reality check.  

Fuck everything.
