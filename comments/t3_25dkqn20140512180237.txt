Same here.  I blew through a stop sign a few weeks ago.  I drive that route all the time.  I *knew* the stop sign was there.  I'm pretty sure I even saw the damn thing, and it just didn't register.  Thank God there was no one around. 

Also, and this is probably a personal thing, but driving makes my morning sickness worse.  Then there is the fact that I'm short and eventually lucky to have an inch of room between my stomach and the steering wheel.

All that said, I've been in one crash while driving while pregnant, and it was 100% not my fault.  Elderly woman didn't see me, the red light, or the six other cars stopped at the red light.
