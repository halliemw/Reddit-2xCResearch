I don't know if the people matter...it's creating a hostile work environment for you (because these people are clients, therefore you do have to work WITH them even if you're not actually coworkers). I don't think the law cares if you're out for cocktails, like you said if it's obviously for a work purpose then it should be pretty simple, you'd think.
