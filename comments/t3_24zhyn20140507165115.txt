Remember that when she's young, she'll like what you like.  Want to build legos for hours on end?  She'll be into it.  Want to go for a hike?  Want to play soccer/football/baseball/basketball whatever sport you're into?  Kids love everything their parents do, and emulate them when they're young.  That's when you get to make a person who becomes an adult you'd want to hang out with.  

the key is to make choices that turn her into a good adult.  Be a good role model.  Think twice about what you say and do before you say and do it.  When you talk to others, that's what she'll see, and one day, that's how she'll treat others.  

Everything about parenting is winging it.  you just have to try to make good choices while you're at it.
