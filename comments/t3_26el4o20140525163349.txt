I don't know much about any other shooters, but I did read some of his manifesto and watch the video of him right before he went on the rampage.  It seemed that he was raised with expectations of certain... *things* that he couldn't realistically attain.  He saw women more as trophies than as people, and if our culture wasn't conducive to that, then maybe he would have opened his eyes before developing into such a creep.  But you might be right, that it was simply due to bullying.  Honestly though, lots of people get bullied and don't go and shoot people.  It takes a special concoction of entitlement and depravity to do something like that.
