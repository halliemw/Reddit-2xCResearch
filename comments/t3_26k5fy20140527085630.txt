I actually just finished med school and I think there's a  limit with "increasing capacity" and thereby limiting the number of hours people work. I'm actually Canadian, but went to medical school in the States, and I saw some of those problems. The first one with increasing capacity beyond controlling for population is you get medical students without the proper training they need because there isn't enough pathology to go around. I met a lot of Caribbean and (sometimes!) DO students who would be forced to rotate at community programs because all the big academic places were already full of allopathic students, and whenever an appropriately complicated case would show up that they would need to know about (beyond the level of mid levels), it went get punted to an academic place; hence you would get poorly trained doctors because there wasn't enough pathology to go around. Another thing is that it takes a LOT of time to train to actually be good at being a doctor. When I first entered medical school i hated the idea of 70 hour work weeks but after doing a bunch of sub internships I realize that I could either stomach them and actually be good at what I do, or not do them and simply not be competent. Simply put, there is not enough time in say the last two years of medical school and residency to become a fully functional doctor if you only work 40-50 hour weeks. You can't: theres no way. I used to think it could be done but my clerkships have painfully shown me otherwise. The only way we could lower work week hours more would be to increase the length of residencies, which would mean an even worse doctor shortage (since people would take forever before they could practice independently) and worse patient outcomes because continuity of care suffers.
