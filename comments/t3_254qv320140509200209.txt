All "Real men do/don't do.." stuff bothers me.  I feel like it creates a divide between "real men" and "men who do bad things" that doesn't actually exist, and reinforces the myths that your male friend, colleague, neighbour, family member, or whatever, isn't capable of doing these things.  I think Tom Meagher described quite well the dangers of buying into these myths in [this article.](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/jill-meagher-s-husband-speaks-about-violence-against-women-and-the-monster-myth-1.1766690)
