I didn't say educate, I said discuss. I'm actually completely against the sort of thing you're referencing here, the idea that women need to be taught the error of their ways. That's specifically why I chose the word discuss but I guess I still came across the wrong way and I'm sorry for that. 

 I've had a lot of discussions with women who wear head coverings for their own personal and religious reasons and I've come to realise that the attitude of "we just have to show them that this is wrong!" is problematic.
