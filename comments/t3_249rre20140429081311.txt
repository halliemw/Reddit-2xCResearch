I don't know. I don't see what's so creepy about a father and daughter having a nice night out and showing her how it feels to be loved and treated well. Mostly the author seems to have  an issue with their view of sex before marriage, which would exist with or without the purity ball. If my dad had done something like this with me, I would have felt so special and loved. 

There are certainly problems with "purity culture," but events like these are not one of them. 

Edit: Is there a reason this is getting downvoted apart from the fact that people don't agree with my views on Christian sexuality? Please enlighten me.
