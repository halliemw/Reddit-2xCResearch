I think the more extreme things (finding porn on your computer, blatant sexual remarks) happened more rarely to these women over a course of several years. Not trying to downplay what happened, because it's still shouldn't happen at all. However, the general downplay of a women's achievements, "innocent" sex jokes, and the like are far more common and the men/women perpetuating it may not even know what they're doing. Sexism is so engrained into our culture that most of us, myself included, don't know what we're doing/saying/whatever is sexist without realizing it.

Hell, before I got hired as a lab aide I was asked if I had any kids (I think this is illegal? But she asked me before the official interview, when I was asking her if a position was available. Still bullshit, if I had kids I'd make it work)

Plus, the tech industry is full of nerds who don't want "non-nerds" penetrating their "club". And some of these nerds include women as "non-nerds". They're the same men who will use the term "girl gamers" instead of just...gamers. I've met some cool as shit people in my field (as a fledgling, mind you) but sometimes the neckbeard is strong.
