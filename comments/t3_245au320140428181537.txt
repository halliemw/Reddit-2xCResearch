If you're mentally up for it but your parts don't want to work with you, you may just be a woman that doesn't produce enough natural lubrication, and needs it externally. So give that a try. If you're using condoms, stick to water or silicone based lube. If you're not, coconut oil is a popular choice on /r/sex.

If that doesn't help, you probably need to get at least some stimulation if not an actual orgasm before moving to PIV. A lot of folks abide by a "she comes first" rule, for a number of reasons, a prominent one being that statistically speaking women find it easier to start again than men. If your guy doesn't like this rule (which is fair, especially if he can easily start again), then you might consider getting him off a different way (e.g. oral) before moving on.
