I see the use of 'so' to start sentences as a less abrupt segue into the post.  It seems to soften the start of the post so that it is not as in-your-face-hello-here-it-is. 
Also, an interesting idea has occurred to me that, OP (And myself since I am also female) use 'so' as in introductory word to slip quietly into a conversation instead of outright stating the facts/sentence.  If you tried, you could also relate that to gender norms within our society blah blah blah.... 

I don't actually want to start down that path, but it occurred to me that it could be a contributing factor.
