This woman knew she was in a structural position to inflict maximum damage (mother-in-law!)  I had one like that long ago, and while it's not why my marriage failed (husband unfailingly took my side), it's much worse to have mother-in-law crap coming your way than many other kinds of crap.

It's simply hard not to over-react.  This is why getting married is so much more difficult than it first seems.  We say we're not going to change, and someone (in this case, your mother-in-law) is determined to make sure you do.  She knows she's able to get under your skin like no other (I know several mothers-in-law like this).  In fact, a sister-in-law did something like this to my daughter and deep inside, I still want vengeance!  

It's not about whether or not makeup would look better for a photo shoot (yeah, I look back on my makeup free days with some ambivalence - but they were *my* choices).  That's not the issue.

The issue is that a new family member, one of a type that is known to cause lifelong trouble, has started making trouble.  She needs to be on very good behavior for a long time to make up for this and if she needles you again in anyway, just remember to start using psychological shields.  They'll come in handy anyway, but sad you have to use them in your husband's family.
