I am sorry that your nurse handled the situation that way :( You should not have had to feel as embarrassed as you did. She should have been compassionate, realized how embarrassed you must have felt, and cleaned up the blood as quickly as possible while helping you keep as much dignity as possible. Bringing in a male tech? What the heck. And asking you "so what do you want to do?". Well, obviously if you weren't hooked up to a million tubes and machines, doped up, and dealing with freakin cancer surgery you would want to go to the bathroom and cleaned yourself up. Was she hoping you would say "oh just leave it, I'l be just fine, don't worry about it". Sorry, I had to rant! I have so much respect for nurses, but not when they act as though they have no compassion. Are you home now? I hope you are comfortable now and recovering well. 

P.S. the hospital I used to work for had "Henry" in the name, so we would tell our patients those mesh underwear were called "Henry's Secret".
