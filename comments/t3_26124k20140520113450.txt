You wouldn't be having any signs this early, after only a few days.

Your cramps, emotional-ness, that's all you - not a pregnancy. The stress of you freaking out is not helping.

And if it was right after your period, you probably weren't ovulating and couldn't get pregnant - not every woman is the same, but most ovulate ~14 days after the start of their period.
