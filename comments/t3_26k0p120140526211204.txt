I didn't meet my fiance's friends for two years and when we finally met they were all really shocked that I existed. He'd mentioned me over the years, but they just thought he was trolling since I'd never materialized. They're his drinking buddies and I'm not a big drinker so I don't see them often, but it's clear when I do that he acts differently around them than around me. I bet he would have been invited to things solo during that time too. What makes OP's story weird is that she's got a kid and he MUST have mentioned that at some point!
