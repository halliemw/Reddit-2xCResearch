 Setting boundaries isn't abusive. Everyone has different ideas about what is cheating and what isn't, which is why you need to be able to communicate these things in a relationship. When my husband first met me, I had no issue with cybersex (and engaged in it occasionally), yet once he told me he considers it a form of emotional cheating, I understood because I respected him and his boundaries.
