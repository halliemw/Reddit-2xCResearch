Definitely do not want this lady to influence my kid. The other day she was talking to me and she said something like "Hah, I keep calling it y'alls house, but it's your house! Everyone knows the house always belongs to the woman. Your house, your car." And she always makes comments about how women work harder than men, even though she hasn't worked in 15 years and just lays around the house all day. Oh and she was offering some of her mom's stuff to us. She was saying stuff like "do yall need silverware? My mom has some nice silverware yall can have, and a cutlery set! She has a bunch of nice plates you can have, too."

Even if my kid never knows this lady very well I dont think she's going to be traumatized for life or hate me for it. I didn't know my dad's parents that well and I'm indifferent about it. I really don't want my daughter to see her as a role model.
