Any truth to the idea that excess skin is really just stubborn fat deposits? I feel like I've read that somewhere..

Looking good was definitely my motivation for losing weight, struggled with it all throughout my teens, finally managed to get most of it off in my early twenties only to be "rewarded" with babar like skin(probably why he never took that suit off.)

Anyways you look stunning and your attitude is inspiring.
