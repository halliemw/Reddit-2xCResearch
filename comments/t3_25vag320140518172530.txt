To me, it just sounds like she had a bad day. I definitely have those days when everything is going wrong (major paper due, my mom calls because of a family emergency, my grandparents are sick, I missed the train, etc all in one days) and I'm on the verge of tears already just because I'm so stressed out and then the grocery store is out of yogurt and I just start crying because I can't handle one more thing going wrong.
