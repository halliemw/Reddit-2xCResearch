Weird... when I was in grad school, most women wore cosmetics daily. Not sure what you mean by "full-face;" when I do wear makeup, it's just some eyeliner and shadow and some lipstick. I had the HR director recommend against hiring me because even though I was in a suit, hose, and pumps, with my hair tidy, I wasn't wearing any makeup, and that *by itself* was unprofessional.

So yeah, we live in a world where wearing makeup is normalized, and not wearing any makeup is weird. And I'm acutely aware of that because I almost never wear makeup. And when people comment like "Oh, look at you, all done up!" and crap like that, they're reinforcing that women *should* wear makeup. If you want people to feel like they have a choice and it's something they do "for them," then don't say anything about it. Because yeah, it's damaging.
