I tried to get him to explain why he thought that but he could come up with no real valid answer which was frustrating. i am a genuine 'thinker' so when people dont actively think stuff like that, it is strange to me. 

Yes, you are right, its different for friends and even coworkers because we know each other on a personal level and they could be trying to set me up and such so I totally get it.

Also, to add icing on the cake, that guy met me from a dating website that clearly said I was interested in men only. Maybe Im a liar?? lol
