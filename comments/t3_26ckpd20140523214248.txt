I feel like you feel a bit snubbed, and maybe your questioning yourself, and the steps you've taken to get to where you are. I think it's very natural to feel bothered by someone who's younger, but seems to be 2 steps ahead of you. Just realize that this person might have had better/more opportunities than you, or maybe knew exactly what he wanted/needed and made it happen as quickly as possible.

Honestly it does suck that they have split the position like that, but I would say that maybe you could turn to them for advice, or see if they'll help you find more opportunities for yourself. Maybe try to see them as their own person, as opposed to just someone younger and your underclass man.
