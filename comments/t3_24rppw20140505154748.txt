Ugh I'm glad someone posted this! When I first saw the article I was immediately creeped out, but when I read the article (I'm not sure it was this exact website) that made me feel like I was crazy for thinking this was crazy because they talked about how these were just fathers trying to protect their daughters. 

But there's something really off to me about this whole thing. It doesn't seem ok to me for fathers to be compelling their daughters to make some kind of pledge that is so personal. A pledge that personal shouldn't be forced on someone or shouldn't have anyone else weigh in on it. At least that's how I'm looking at it.
How about a pledge that fathers take to teach their daughters to recognize the signs of an abusive relationship or maybe a pledge that fathers take to teach their sons how to appropriately treat women (i.e. not being sexist little punks)?
