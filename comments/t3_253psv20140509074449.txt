I didn't start going to a gyno until I was 20 and had already been sexually active for two years and had multiple partners. In hindsight, I *really* wish I had gone sooner, for both health reasons and reassurance reasons.

Also, I found it rather empowering the first time I went, knowing I was taking care of my body and being responsible for my decisions to have sex.
