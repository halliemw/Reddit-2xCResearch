I agree with you. My school did not have uniforms but it had a strict dress code. The dress code teaches you how to dress for certain situations in the future. Cleavage and short skirts are not acceptable at my office so why should they be acceptable in high school? Although I am against the idea of a dress code simply because the way men could think, I do agree a dress code is appropriate to teach girls that there is a time and a place for certain outfits. How often do I see high schoolers walking around my town and I say to myself "her shorts are way too short" or "I can see her whole stomach!?"  The problem with kids is you give them an inch they take a mile. You say ok skirts to the knees are ok and people show up with skirts a little above the knee and then shorter and shorter until the school has to say no more skirts only jeans allowed now. It sucks that our society has certain norms that are expected but I think kids need to learn them early so they know what is appropriate. Most of the time it isn't even men ogling, it's other women talking about how inappropriate someone's outfit looks.
