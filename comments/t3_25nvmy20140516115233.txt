Encourage your friend to contact a victim's advocate at a local crisis center or RAINN, just to talk  and vent. Most have dealt with/witnessed the sometimes insensitive way that law enforcement professionals deal with rape victims, and can share their perspectives and support your friend-- hopefully make her feel a tiny bit better.

It'd be awesome if officers were trained in sensitivity or regarded victim service as a priority, but it's just not the case. Their training and consideration is mostly involved in discovering evidence and capturing affirmed bad guys. Furthermore, it is common for sexual violence victims to feel that they are being judged, called liars, not believed, shamed, blamed-- and sometimes they totally are, but in some cases it's more a matter of people don't know how to be comforting in that situation, or that they have an agenda (like a police officer or a prosecutor) that is different from the victim's.
