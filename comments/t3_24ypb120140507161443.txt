Eeee! Congratulations!

 I found lots of budget inspiration in the book/blog Offbeat Bride, There were some amazing fun DIY things done on tiny, tiny budgets. I Imagine pinterest is like HUGELY useful to a bride these days as well!

Figure out with your boy what you two can afford, and what you care about most and prioritize your budget that way. For me, food and photography that felt candid but documented my family having a good time was paramount. A brass band, a church ceremony, and expensive flowers were not so much.

One thing that really worked out well for me was http://www.growersbox.com/. They have these "wedding in a box boxes, with TONS of flowers. So cool, significantly less than having a florist put stuff together.
