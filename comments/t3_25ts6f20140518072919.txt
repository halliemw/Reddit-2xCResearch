I've been on it for 3 1/2 years and that has never happened to me. Maybe for the first week or so, make sure not to eat anything too irritating and don't do anything crazy like bungee jumping. :) I love Zoloft. It's been my favorite antidepressant I've ever tried, and both my depression and anxiety are much more manageable. Don't let potential side effects keep you from peace and happiness.
