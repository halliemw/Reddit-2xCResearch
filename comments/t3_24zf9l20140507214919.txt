> The typical failure rate of large numbers of pill users is less than 3% per year when women who miss pills are included.

The only time I get nervous is if I haven't been perfect with taking it (and usually this means I was a few hours late in taking it, not a day late), and even then, it's this statistic that makes me feel okay. (I also have thought through and feel okay about my options if I were to get pregnant.)

Sometimes I get silly and have the opposite and really unlikely thought: what if the fact that I've never accidentally gotten pregnant on birth control means I'm infertile? It's such a silly fear --oh no, my birth control appears to be working, what if that really means I can't ever have kids and the BC isn't working at all?! -- but it does pop into my head sometimes. I guess some part of me just expects that I'd be the 1%! (or 3%, to err on the side of caution)
