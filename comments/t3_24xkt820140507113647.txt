That was my thought too! I feel like so often people will say "End rape culture!" but then condemn a single a rapist. Certainly that one person needs to accept their part of the blame for what they've done, but what about the family that raised him? What about his friends who laughed and cheered him on? What about the school that tells him he can wear whatever clothes he chooses, but all the girls must cover up their private bits so as to not distract other students from their school work? I love this point of view and the way they delivered it was amazing. Props to these two poets!
