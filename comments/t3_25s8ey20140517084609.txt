And if hospitals feels that chart is still too subjective. [here](https://lane.stanford.edu/portals/cvicu/HCP_Neuro_Tab_4/0-10_Pain_Scale.pdf) is a chart that I love. Its still subjective and needs improving, But it is 1000x better than the arbitrary 10-10 faces. especially in the case of long-term pain.
