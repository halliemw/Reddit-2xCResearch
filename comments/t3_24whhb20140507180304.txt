I use to be completely ok with abortion. My mind has changed on the subject. People's minds change all the time. I use to be anti-gay marriage when I was a lot younger. Just because you have a strong viewpoint at one time, doesn't mean you'll have the same viewpoint later. And this happens with women a lot as well. They say they'll get an abortion if they get pregnant, then can't bring themselves to do it once they do. When something major like this happens, your viewpoints can change.
