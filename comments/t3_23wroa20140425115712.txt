As a bisexual minority, I get it.

I just think it's unhealthy to call people names, especially when you don't really know the full context. Name calling helps no one.

They were insensitive, and they clearly do not know how to handle this situation appropriately. I agree with you in that one. 

I'm saying that it might not come down to privilege at all, it could be that, like in my example, that they just want to make their daughter happy and SINCERELY believe she is gay. I'm saying it may not come from a place of guilty acceptance, but a place of love. We don't know which for sure, as we don't know the specifics, but calling it white privilege may be a little excessive.
