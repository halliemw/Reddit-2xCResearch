I think that in many places on reddit, including this one, people downvote (and I am talking pre-default days) because they disagree with your point of view. Which is not how downvotes are "supposed" to function.

In order to speak here, I need to remind myself that "karma" is a meaningless, worthless concept. Because I get more downvotes here than anywhere else on reddit.
