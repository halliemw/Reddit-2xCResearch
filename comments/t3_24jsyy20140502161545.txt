THANK YOU!
    
Even though it is not perfectly relevant to this article (b/c the man admitted to raping the girl), too many people do not understand that rape is THE LACK OF CONSENT. This means that *not saying yes* is rape; this is distinct from *saying no*. There is no requirement to say no! There IS a requirement for each party to get consent from the other!
