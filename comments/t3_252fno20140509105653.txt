I Don't see that analogy as the same thing, but i wouldn't care. Atheists are allowed to talk about theology. It isn't really the same thing because that is a gigantic group telling a tiny group to not come. Women and Men supply the same population more or less. Plus both of those groups tend to not like the other one, stereotypically and ,especialy your music analogy. Most men like women, so that analogy is really bad. There is no honor on the internet, and as long as 2x is a front page it is going to have deal with men participating or adapt their mission statement.
