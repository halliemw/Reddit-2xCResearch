The implant that I'm talking about is called Nexplanon, and it releases progestin. There's also an IUD that does the same, but it may not be good for her if she has endo that's gone untreated for too long.

Honestly, she needs to talk to her doctor about those fears. The first birth control I was on made me depressed, but the one I'm on now works just fine. My old roommate was an angry bitch on her first birth control, but was herself on the one she's on now. It's possible she'll have to try multiple different pills, but honestly it's either that or she risks her fertility and she endures a lot more pain that could be prevented or she forfeits her fertility totally and has an endometrial ablation and sterilization. Her doctor may not perform that last option if you're young, because she hasn't exhausted her options and she could regret it and doctors don't want to be sued.
