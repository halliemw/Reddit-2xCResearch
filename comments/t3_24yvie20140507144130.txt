That makes sense about the downvotes. I didn't know twox had been made into a default. I have been blocking and ignoring them, and I made my account private and plan on leaving it that way for a few months so I'm sure they will get bored with trying to harass me further. But I didn't figure there was any harm in contacting campus police.
