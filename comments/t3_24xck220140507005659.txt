I don't agree with forcing an opinion about the moral issues involved with abortion onto someone either.

I do believe though that a person should be able to tell a woman that having a baby (not necessarily keeping, but having) is a valid option when they have an unexpected pregnancy without that first person being annihilated by others. 

A woman deserves to hear all options, not just that abortion is an option. And one of those options is continuing the pregnancy.
