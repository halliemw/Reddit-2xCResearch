You definitely did the right thing here.  She may very well have been embarrassed by the whole situation,  I've gotten so drunk I passed out before on a night out with an old friend.  I was gutted in case I acted like an idiot,  I didn't speak to her again tbh.  Then again she turned out to be a jerk but w/e. Maybe give it a couple of weeks before you get in touch again and suggest coffee or lunch?  Something where you can really reconnect that doesn't involve drinking til you pass out :) I'd be made up if I had a friend like you.
