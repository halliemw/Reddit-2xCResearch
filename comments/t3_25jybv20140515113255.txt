>I don't mention religion in this at all 

Neither does she. "Ideology" does not mean "religion." It's your opinion, in this case, which you think should be made into a law.

You also seem to think that carrying a pregnancy and giving birth are "better" and a woman would never regret doing it if she were well, even though it would impact her for a lifetime in many ways.

I think in the UK, you also have the advantage of not having strict cut-off dates after which it becomes illegal to have an abortion, or nearby areas of hundreds of miles that have no abortion clinics at all (except maybe Ireland, which has its own issues).
