The ones that creep me out most are just when men touch me though I've given them no indication this is ok. 

Like random strangers at the bar come up and put their arm around my shoulders and offer to buy me a drink. Guess what? I'm a black belt, and I'm going to almost break your arm if you don't get your d*** hands off me right now.
