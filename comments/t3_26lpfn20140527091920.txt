Self-support on bills that only I incur, like my cell phone, car insurance, gas, and credit cards. Everything else is paid for by my SO, including 1/2 the groceries (at least). During the Spring/Fall semesters I go to school 15+ hours a week.

I don't work (like make money) 10 hours a week. With my type of work, it can be as little at 5 hours a week and be enough to pay *my* bills. Housework is 10 hours a week. Sorry if I wasn't too clear. :/
