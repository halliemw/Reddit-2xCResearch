25, had a bad reaction at 15 and thus my earlobe are now hole free. Do what you like! Now that I think of it, only my sister and Aunt have proper piercings. You'd not know it as well with my grandmother, she has a beautiful collection of clip-ons. Frankly I'd never notice unless it was giant hoops or gauges. So, there you go. There's plenty of other things to make you feel "girly" or more realistically, yourself.
