>All identifying factors – name, age, gender, address – will be removed from resumes submitted for senior and executive roles at the bank from now on.

That's fantastic. That also weeds out discrimination based on age, gender, and probably even things like race (which can be given away from your name) and class (which can be given away from where you live), at least until the interview stage. I'd be so interested to see whether there'd be a change in the demographics of senior bankers in the coming months.
