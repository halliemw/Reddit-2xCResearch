Because we're humans, and as my grandmother used to say, just because you're in love with your partner it doesn't mean you don't have eyes. 

However, there's a line between "subtly appreciating the beauty and sexiness of any human being who catches your eye" and "ogling, pursuing and/or otherwise harassing said object of sexiness, particularly in the presence of said loved one."

If your partner is disrespectful of your relationship (e.g. by catcalling, comparing you to someone else, even flirting with them, in front of you) then hell yeah be pissed. But if your partner is human and has a pulse they cannot wear blinkers all day. Sexual drive is a normal part of a lot of people's make up (excluding asexuals, etc etc) and to pretend it doesn't exist is just going to cause everyone a headache.
