> Men that want to come in here and send dick picks like an asshole are gonna come in here and do it anyway. 

The problem won't be the overt trolls, who are going to come here either way. The problem will be the millions of males who don't care about feminine issues or who want to make jokes about them.

What you are going to see is a transition away from run of the mill female topics to hot button political issues(Abortion) and posts pandering to men("Should girls have to sign up for the draft?").

This is much harder than you think. The thing about being a default subreddit is you get a constant onslaught of bad posts and it never ends. If the mods go offline for a few hours, then you get a few rule breaking posts on the front page before they are deleted. 

And to make it worse, TwoX is largely dominated by discussion threads, so you can't just police the posts, you also have to police comments in those posts.
