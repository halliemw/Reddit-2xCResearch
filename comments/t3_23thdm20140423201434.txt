I would be pretty pissed. He used it as an excuse to get time off to do the things *he* needed to do, **NOT** to take care of you in any way. 

My boyfriend's grandfather recently passed, and I took the day off to go to the funeral. The burial was the next day and I had to work. I *wanted* to be there for him but it was pretty clear it would be family only.

I wish I would have taken the second day off, though, because I broke down crying as soon as I got in. I couldn't stop. I think that's a **LOT** different than needing to pick up a fucking kayak...

But that's just my two cents.
