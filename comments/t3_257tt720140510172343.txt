The fact that you have had normal paps in the past means that you should be fine waiting the three years for another pap, but I am not a doctor. Cervical cancer is a fairly slow moving cancer. There are a lot of steps that it takes before it even becomes cancer. I screen cell samples using a microscope for cancer and paps are the main bulk of my day.  It can take 10+ years for a we call a low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion(LGSIL) to even become malignant. However, paps are not foolproof, but they have greatly reduced the occurrence of cervical caner. It is one of the most successful screening test we have for a type cancer. The vaccine for HPV has also greatly helped.
