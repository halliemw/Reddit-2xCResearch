I agree with stoner on if you're willing to help then do it completely. However does she know you've told people? From my point of view it is no one's business to tell except her's and if she trusts you enough to tell then she would except explicit confidentiality. 

I'm curious as well with the "at night" issue stoner brings up, no one should have to fight through demons such as that alone. If this happened a few weeks ago, you can be damned sure she is not "ok". 

And if it is too much for you then you should tell her. There's nothing wrong with you taking a step back. She'll understand.
