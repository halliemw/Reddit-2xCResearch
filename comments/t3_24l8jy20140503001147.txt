I just got a temporary restraining order in place on Wednessday. I haven't been able to serve him because he moved that same day and I don't know where. I was going to talk with the cop when he called me back but he hasn't done so yet.

My kids and I live with my grandma right now. And we have other family close by. But I work a half hour away from home and no one to stop by. 

I have a folder on my laptop with over 300 screen shots of messages. The originals seem to disappear off of my sites. I had more than 500 emails from him just in a few days I was saving and they all disappeared. I didn't delete them. I try blocking him but he just makes new accounts.

Thank you for the link! I'll head over there and see what I can see.
