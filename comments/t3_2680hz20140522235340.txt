I guess you're just friendly in your job in way that feels genuine. All these guys feeling motivated to go further with you, they probably react to that. I've been in the situation myself where I wondered if the *very* friendly server was really just professionally friendly or flirtatious. And if you see an opportunity as man it's hard to pass it up (because waiting to be hit upon by a woman is usually not a winning strategy). And if you're easy on the eyes the part where you don't wear makeup and stuff makes you even more approachable and non-threatening.

This all could be the reason for you being hit upon more than you like, and it would also explain why particularly the quiet men go for you - I imagine that friendly, warm interactions with women are rare enough for some of them that they immediately see you in a very rosy light, akin to the tired "you could say things are getting pretty serious" meme.

Admittedly, I'm interpreting very freely here, but perhaps in the future, you can view those goofballs who don't talk and then want to date as a compliment to your warm persona, not as an insult to your personality? :)
