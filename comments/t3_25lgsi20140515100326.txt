One big thing was have goals in mind. After our one year, we decided we'd take a vacation over the summer. It was a similar situation as to what you were in. We went to school states and states away, so we saw each other every three months/when we had breaks from school. If you set a goal, it's something you guys can look forward to and even plan together! You can make up little goals along the way, or have a 'bucket list' of the things you want to do when you see each other again. Never would I have thought I could do 4 years. Through that time though, you get to discover yourself, have independence, and have that feeling of companionship that there is someone who really and truly loves you. I hope this helps! :)
