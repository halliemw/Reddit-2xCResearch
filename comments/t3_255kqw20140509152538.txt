Thank you!  I had this conversation recently with a friend of mine who was horrified when I told her people need to wipe their urine off the seat so that I don't sit in it.  Of course, she was all, "*GASP* you sit on the public toilet seats?  That's so unsanitary!"  All the other girls there agreed that I am some kind of savage.  It wouldn't be so goddamn unsanitary if you'd all sit down when you take a piss.  

Honestly, the places you are mostly likely to pick up germs in a public bathroom is not the toilet seat--they're the sinks, door handles, and the flush levers.
