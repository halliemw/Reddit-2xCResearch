She took the teeth out of her editorial by glossing over traits that are undesirable by a larger audience than the traits she called out.  The 'feel good' remains at the expense of a more honest admission.  It's acceptance in a matter of degrees.


Full lips = desirable
Very Dark Skin = controversial (many Africans feel pressure to lighten their skin, but a large portion of people like dark skin)
Kinky hair = controversial (certainly a majority of people use product in their hair, often straightening)
Big, Ethnic Nose = very small population sees this as a desirable trait
