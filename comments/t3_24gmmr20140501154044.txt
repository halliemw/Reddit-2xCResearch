I'm the scheduling "boss" at a minimum wage place and the only reason I *really* need a two weeks notice is because we do schedules two weeks in advance so that if there are scheduling conflicts, we can work them out within that time frame. It hurts shifts and your former coworkers when you don't give notice of your leaving, and it can hurt continuously for two weeks until you're out of the schedules entirely.
