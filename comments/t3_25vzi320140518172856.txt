If you get meds for bv they can cause a yeast infection. If you get meds for a yeast infection they won't help bv. Please get examined.

This is nothing to be embarrassed about. Sorry, but you need to be able to go to the doctor about this stuff. If you can't handle talking about common issues how will you get help for something serious? 

Find a female nurse practitioner, they're usually easier to have poking around than men or someone with a Dr title. When you call the office say you're new to this stuff and want someone calm and easy going (or business like, whichever suits you) and they will likely be accommodating.
