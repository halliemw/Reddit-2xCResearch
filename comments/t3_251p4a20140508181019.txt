I don't know what the point of making 2x a default is, I wasn't the one who made the decision. I'm not sure if it was the right decision to take an existing sub and shove it into the spotlight, no. 

I can see both sides, though - that it could be very good to show that there are subs for and about women, to encounter the inherent bias that permeates the rest of Reddit. It's kinda similar to how many college campuses have LGBT clubs but not 'straight clubs' - because straight people aren't a minority. 

That said, I wouldn't actually object to /r/oney being made a default. I think the Reddit admins were probably thinking 'well, so much of Reddit focuses on men already, it's not needed', but I get what you're saying. 

One objection I do have, though, is your comment about males being irritated. There's frequently stuff on the front page that is about and for guys but I don't think anyone would take kindly to women complaining about 'having' to see it on the front page. Men can unsubscribe and ignore this sub just as women can unsubscribe and ignore the other stuff.
