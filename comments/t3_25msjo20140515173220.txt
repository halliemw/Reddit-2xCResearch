The only choices victims have on regard of rape are:

* resist or not;

* report or not;

And in most of these cases it has several things attached to them, not only the desire to get justice or closing. There is the social stigma, the Thrauma that can be really bad even if the rape had no "real violence". There is not a significative number of rapes on nudist beaches as far as I know and it is the place where people go to get nude. Rape is simply one of the worst thing that can rape to a person.
