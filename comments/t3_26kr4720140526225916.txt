Look at it this way: Sure you've got a few goals that haven't been reached but you have:

*A bachelors degree and soon a masters which are hugely beneficial in today's job market
*A nice SO
*Good sense on money matters not to go into massive debt in order to have a wedding
*First world trappings of an internet and facebook account

You're well on your way to being a full fledged adult. Stop worrying so much about things you don't have and start enjoying what you do while you continue to work to better your life. Hope that doesn't sound harsh, it isn't meant to be. Just trying to give you some perspective that things are pretty good for you.
