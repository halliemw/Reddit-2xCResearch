Well it was kind of a shock and the biggest complaint of all was that the community was not asked. At all. It just happened. Sure there has been some good, but it's a big change and hard to get used to. 

I'm over it, personally. What happened happened and there isn't anything for me to do except to continue posting like always and report when necessary. Maybe throw out a few extra upvotes when necessary. 

However, I'm tired of seeing "you just want this place to be a circlejerk and that's why you're upset about the default" because that is completely wrong for most people here. I was just mentioning other aspects of the issue.
