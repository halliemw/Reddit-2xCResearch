My only advice would be for her to just be herself.  Everyone gets nervous when meeting new people.  I'm sure this guy will understand that if he's as nice as he's been made out to be.  Perhaps just look at it like a trial run.  She's just getting some practice of getting back into the dating scene.  If it's a good date, then awesome.  And if it's not then at least the scary aspect of it being her "first date in two decades" will be gone. Lots of luck to your mom!
