Gardasil doesn't provide immunity from all strains of HPV.  It only protects against the strains that have been proven to cause cervical cancer.  

I'd be wary of any diagnosis based upon one photo alone, however if the doctor who saw the picture was 100% sure that it was HPV, then perhaps it was caused by a strain that Gardasil does not protect against.

Alternatively, if you were sexually active prior to receiving the full course of Gardasil, then it is possible that, prior to immunisation, you may have been infected with any of the HPV strains.  Gardasil does not retroactively protect you if you have already been infected.
