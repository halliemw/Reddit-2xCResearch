No, CPS is no use to you then. Can your siblings move out? It won't help your mom at all, but it would be better for them. Other than that, call the cops every time it happens. That's really all you can do. Well, that, and try to convince your mom to go to therapy. She may find the strength she needs to leave if she gets a little perspective. If your siblings move out but are in the same town, she would also have a place to go if/when she leaves, which makes it that much easier for her to do it.
