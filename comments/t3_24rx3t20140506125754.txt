Probably growing up; backlash against feminism certainly isn't anything new.   To my mind, part of the problem is that these forums often include adults, adolescents and children, all thrown together anonymously and posting on equal footing.  Most 13-year-olds do not understand the nuance and context in place when a feminist talks about 'patriarchy' or 'privilege'; they certainly don't feel powerful or privileged, and they tend to react very negatively until they are educate to the real issues at hand.
