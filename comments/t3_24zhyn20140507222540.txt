THANK YOU. Stop focusing on "I don't know anything about girls" and start seeing her as a human. Gender expectations are so fucked up. Expose your child to everything possible and let them choose what they like, gender be damned. A lot of adults look back on their childhoods in a not so fond way because they were forced into one thing or another. Raise a hard working, thoughtful, well rounded person who knows they are loved and you will have done well.
