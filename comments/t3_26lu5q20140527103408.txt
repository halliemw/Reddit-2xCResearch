I was one of "those girls" for a while and let me tell you, I was miserable. I thought I could be happy by devoting my life to "fitness" but it literally consumed me and I developed an eating disorder. Like, my biggest accomplishment of the day would be choosing salad over fries with my order at a restaurant not because I wanted salad, but because I was scared of fries. 

It's been a couple of years and I am definitely not one of those girls anymore, but I can still totally relate to what you're saying. One of the things that pisses me off most about diet/fitness/health culture is "guilt-free" recipes. Like, why the fuck do my brownies have to be low fat in order to be "guilt-free?" Why can't I just eat a delicious brownie with a cup and a half of sugar and half a cup of oil in the recipe and still love myself?! 

Now I do yoga every morning because I love it. It actually helped me overcome a lot of the guilt I felt for trying to love myself (isn't that just an awful thing--feeling guilty for loving yourself? Oh society). I get my 8-a-day servings of fruit and vegetables but that doesn't mean I don't occasionally eat half a box of frozen eggrolls and a bottle of wine for dinner. It's all about balance.
