All I have to say is I've completely ignored any negative attention of my ex's new gf and my current boyfriend's ex. Completely. Ignored. I honestly do not even know what my boyfriend's ex looks like. I didn't know what my ex's new gf looked like until after I was over him. One hundred percent blinders on me- and I'm glad I made that decision. It's been nearly six years since I've felt jealousy that had to do with boys. Take it from me- it's a nice feeling. 


Each of these girls eventually moved on with their lives and with new men, and hopefully they feel a little silly now. 

She thinks you've "won" and is trying to bring you down. Since you are not a child, and you know it's not a contest, you have no obligation to play.
