I'm really sorry for what happened to you. I've worked with a abuse victim advocacy group and it's stomach-turning how often the "what were you wearing" question is brought up in cases, even ones with younger victims. I hope you're doing much better, and I'm glad your fiance is such a stand-up guy.
