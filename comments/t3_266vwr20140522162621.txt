I think a key phrase is "I learned early on to just sit and take it."  Unlearn this.  (You have already started unlearning it, obviously).  Next time, be sure you end the diatribe by walking out on it, don't let it just run down.  

What I found (similar mom) is that trying to address what she'd already said was pointless.  I waited until the next time I had some outrageous behavior to report (that I didn't want to lie about or that I thought was pertinent to conversation in some way or because I wanted to disagree with her) and made a conscious effort to listen to an equal number of minutes as what I'd just used up (which was usually 2-5 minutes).

If she tried to start it again later (usually on the phone), I practiced "gotta go, bye!" (I'd heard other people do this successfully by then) in my head and then learned to apply to mom in real life.

Our relationship thereby began to get better.  There was a sort of dull, sour period before it did, but by the time she was 70 and I was 38, it was much better.  I'm glad I stuck it out with my mom, in the end.  She was lied to and heavily shaped by her own sucky family.
