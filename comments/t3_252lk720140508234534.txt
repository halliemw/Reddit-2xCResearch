If I may interject: I'm an Iranian-American currently staying in Iran. I've so far been here for a little over two months. The last time I was here was ten years ago.

Although *rusaris* (in Farsi we don't refer to them as Hijabs) are legally mandated by law, it's not as strict as some are claim. Make no mistake, when I was here ten years ago, it absolutely was. It was a different place, really. 

Now, however, with Rhouani (the new President) things have become a lot more relaxed. Although in world news it claims he has done NOTHING (and that point is debatable) there is a sense in the air that things ARE a little different. I'm not saying I can go outside sans montoe (a jacket that covers your arms and goes to your knees,) but it's not NEARLY as bad as it used to be. Rusaris today are worn so loose, they're practically falling off. My hair constantly shows when I wear mine. Like, a lot. 

I've been outside a lot where my rusari just falls and I don't IMMEDIATELY adjust it. I've sat in a restaurant for a whole meal without wearing it. And mind you, I look local. I'm full Iranian from both my parents. 

Now, is it cool to do it front of police? No. And I'm not going to try. And I *highly* suggests no one does at this point in time. But in less populated places, or in a car at night, or on the road driving and there's not a whole lot of people around (as it appears where these women are in the photo,) yeah go for it. 

I understand the point of the Facebook group that the article is covering is to empower women, and to inspire, but I feel in a way it does so by exploiting ignorance of those who don't know how the majority of Iranian women live their daily lives. 

**TL;DR: It's not THAT big of a deal to take of your rusari (Hijab) in a not really populated space in Iran. A fair amount of women do it in city areas, and to exploit Western ignorance on Iran to grab attention for a Facebook group is kind of shady.**
