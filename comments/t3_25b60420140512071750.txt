I think it's interesting that we, as women, get angry when men go "not all men!" but when fat women express frustration at the standards they're expected to meet skinny women jump in and are upset.  All bodies are good bodies, yes, but fat women face far more hatred than skinny women.  All women's bodies are policed but a fat woman is not only policed but found offensive.
