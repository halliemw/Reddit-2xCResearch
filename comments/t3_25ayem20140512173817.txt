The only nit I have to pick with the article is this one:

>A study headed by Anne Steiner, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, the results of which were presented in June, found that among 38- and 39-year-olds who had been pregnant before, 80 percent of white women of normal weight got pregnant naturally within six months (although that percentage was lower among other races and among the overweight).

The whole "women who have been pregnant before" thing is mentioned elsewhere in the article.  I get that she's using it to control for the idea that women who are more fertile finish up with their families sooner, so that just the less-fertile women are hanging around trying to have kids, and that skews the results.  But I'm not sure it applies just as well to women who haven't worried about having kids before; you may well *be* one of the less-fertile women without knowing it.  (Not that the possibility of fertility problems should dictate when you have kids.)  

I'm 34, well into the period when my fertility might naturally be declining, and I pulled off getting pregnant my first "real" postpartum cycle earlier this year, just like I did a decade ago.  But that means I'm good at catching the egg; it has no bearing on the fertility of any other woman my age.

I know she addressed the advice of seeing a fertility specialist much sooner--after 6 months of not conceiving vs. the 12 months usually suggested for younger women--but I'm not sure much of what she's presenting really has any more relevance for her target audience than the studies she dismisses.
