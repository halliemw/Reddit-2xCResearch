It is easy to look at the controversial stuff you describe and dismiss feminism as being the domain of crackpots. Sometimes I find my self no longer assuming someone branding themselves a feminist is a gender equality proponent, because there can be so much co-opted and nonsense stuff, the hyperbolising and victimhood peddling, where they identify and brand themselves as feminists, but distort what feminism should really be; a tool towards egalitarianism.

I really like egalitarianism as a word. Feminsim is more prevalent because historically gender issues have favoured men more often that women. To redress this imbalance and shift it towards a middle and equal position requires more rights for women to be raised than those of men. I hope that, where societies can progress and achieve balance, egalitarism will end up becoming a more prevalent term, as feminism achieves gender equality goals and equality becomes more of a societal norm.

Yeah, I know that's a very idealistic and hoping-for-a-utopian-future view. But I sincerely think that men and women have a fundamental potential for thought, character, creativity and other internal properties that are not dictated by gender dimorphism, and that men and women have a funamental right to be treated equally on those terms.

Also, I've been reading a lot of Ian M Banks' culture novels recently...
