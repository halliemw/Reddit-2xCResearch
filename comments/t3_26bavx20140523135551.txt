Except you were assaulted. Not only did you explain that you were not interested earlier that night, but you also built a physical wall between the two of you when he joined you. It doesn't matter if the wall was made of pillows or stone. The message was clear. Even if none of that had happened, who thinks it is acceptable to fondle a sleeping person/passed out person!? Nobody sane because it is not! Waking up and freezing is completely understandable. It is hard to comprehend the fact that someone you thought was your friend is doing this. He knew he was doing something wrong and he even tried to cover for it the next day when he said you "agreed to it." No, you didn't. How could you have? Obviously we don't know the exact details of what happened with the girl from the bar, but it sounds like she really wasn't in much of a condition to make rational decisions. Judging from how he acted with you, I don't know if any decision on her part was required in his mind.
