5% of Hollywood directors are women [source](http://entertainment.time.com/2012/01/25/only-5-of-directors-in-hollywood-are-women-why-arent-there-more/) - If you're wondering why I included directors, it is because media has a massive influence over society and culture.

The above categories hold a ton of power over our society and our culture, and they are hugely overwhelmingly occupied by men. Thus, those men are driving our society and our culture almost entirely. Women's voices in the driving forces of society and culture are absolutely miniscule.

Now, someone's inevitably going to say that most men don't ever have the opportunity to exercise that much power. And that is obvious.  But when 51% of the population has only 18% of the congress seats, 4.8% of ceo positions, and 5% of director positions, it is very obvious that there is a massive bias towards having men in those positions of power.

That bias is what gives men an advantage in society. Even though many men never have that sort of power, the ones that DO have that power are almost exclusively men, and drive society from a man's perspective, give voice to men's concerns, and masculinity is seen as the "norm" and femininity is seen as something strange, foreign, and unfavorable to society as a whole. Maleness is superior, femaleness is inferior. The bias is unconscious to many, but it *is* there in society as a whole.
