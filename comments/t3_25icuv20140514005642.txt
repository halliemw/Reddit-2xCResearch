Dude, I really hope this shit never happens to you but it sounds like either you have never been in a similar situation or you have a different personality when in crisis moments (different, not better ). 

To say to people to "just stick up for yourself" is patronizing as shit. You think she wouldn't have if she could? Everybody's such a strong warrior knight on the internet ready to fight back a groping pervert. You know how harrowing it can be to out a person doing something so blatant, in a group of people? By far everyone will assume you are drunk and imagined it. Really, play that through your mind:

Creep puts hand on X. 
X says"whar are you doing? Stop touching me!"
Creeo says " huh what are you talking about" the group gets interested in the exchange
X " you were groping my ass. I took your hand away"
Creep " what? Why would I do that. Are you sure you didn't confuse your bag with a hand? You had a bit to drink you know"


Conclusion - nobody believes her or worse, people think she is a drunk attention whore.
