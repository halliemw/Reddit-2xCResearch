Yeah I agree...the one counter-argument I've heard to that, is that "teach rapists not to rape" stuff will cause *other* people to be less tolerant of what the psycopaths do.  But, as someone who's been "taught not to rape" many times, I don't know if that is true.

As a guy you're generally conveyed the message that you desiring girls is an inherently predatory, negative thing.\*  I think the real issue is that if you're taught that any time you want to have sex it's a negative, then it's harder to argue that it's *really* negative in certain situations.  If the "don't rape" stuff is followed up by "...and also, just generally don't have sex," then the whole message gets met with an eye-rolling, "oh these old guys trying to tell us what to do again" reaction.  People will just tend to classify it in their heads as another of the prudish, don't-have-any-fun messages you get as a teenager.

\* Since someone'll bring it up...this isn't to say that girls don't *also* get fucked up messages about sex, they can both be true (and probably go hand-in-hand).
