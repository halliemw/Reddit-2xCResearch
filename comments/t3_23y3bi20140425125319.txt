Telling someone that they don't have a "real reason" to be self-conscious about their body is totally invalidating. I understand what you're trying to say, but the point is this:: women's bodies are under harsh criticism every single day for every single detail. You may think this person had a gorgeous body (and I'd agree!!) but that doesn't mean that she hasn't been told, time and again, that it isn't good enough - that there's more she had to do - that, "yeah (her whatever) is nice, but look at that (other thing about her)." I've got a body that I'm sure a lot of women would be happy to have, but I'm *still* self-conscious. I still wake up hating my body. I still hide parts of it and feel envious of others.

Tl;dr having a body that is closer to some ideal in your mind will not stop you from being self-conscious about your body
