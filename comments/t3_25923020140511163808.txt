Oh I definitely have gorgeous, dark, thick leg hair. My pubes grow over the crease onto my thighs. 

The rest of my thigh hair is blonde, so that's...Contrasting.

We get as many different body hair patterns as we do bodies and I think you have a good point that we rarely talk about variation. But I bet your leg hair is as beautiful and plentiful as mine.
