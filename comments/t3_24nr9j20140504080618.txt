I totally feel you. Love is such a beautiful feeling, but heartbreak is the worst - there is no way to even describe how terrible it feels. I'm gonna say what most everyone else is saying, it's only been three days. I've spent months and months (even years) falling for, then breaking my heart, on the same guy over and over. It fucking sucked. I got hurt so often that I was getting used to the pain, but I can't tell you how many nights or mornings I would be laying in bed bawling my eyes out, feeling like my chest was going to explode or burn up or something. But, I finally just eventually stopped talking to him (most likely because I was growing up) and the pain is nonexistent now, it feels amazing. 

But I know there will be more guys, and there will be more heartbreak. It's just the shitty part that comes with most love. Even if it feels like your world is coming apart, and you won't be able to live without this guy, you totally will, and you'll be over him in no time. Just stay away, try not to think about him, and occupy yourself with hobbies, friends, or whatever! Good luck :)
