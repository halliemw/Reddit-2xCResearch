I don't see what the problem is with this?  Is everyone here forgetting that she is just a child? 

If she didn't like the rules provided she is more than welcome to create her own prom to attend.  However, it is a school function and therefore the people who have been invested with the authority of the school (i.e. chaperones) have the final say.

 Its not like they stopped an adult from doing what she wanted in her private home.
