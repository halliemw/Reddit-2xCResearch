I often describe menopause as being a teenager in reverse. Body changing in strange ways, mood swings from out of nowhere, crying for no particular reason, random panic attacks. 

Be aware that these things can start years before your periods stop. It's called peri-menopause.

and some get none of these

you might get what I had - a never ending period, went on for weeks at at a time, then nothing at all for a long time, then again for weeks. And heavy as hell.

Hot flashes that fck up your sleep cycle drove me nuts. I never felt rested. 

Another fun thing is that your skin will slowly start to lose it's elasticity. Flabby takes on a whole new meaning. Dry skin and dry eyes can be an issue as can a dry vagina. 

But there are good things too. No more cramps! No more wondering if you're period is going to overflow.

Best of all - really knowing what it means to not give a fuck.
