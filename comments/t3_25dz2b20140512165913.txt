It's a 3-way tie:

1. Guy standing behind me in a checkout line starts smelling my perfume and says, "Mmmm, I could stand behind you forever." I turn around and can tell right away that he means business, like he would murder me and stand behind my corpse for all eternity. 

2. Went as the Easter Bunny for Halloween one year and carried a genius easter basket filled with plastic eggs (with Jello shots inside). Dude at a bar wanders over and goes, "Hey, can I ask you a question...? *whispering* Do you need those eggs fertilized?" I don't think he thought that one through. I just walked away with a horrified look on my face.

3. Recently divorced office creeper who is 40 years my senior likes a photo of mine on LinkedIn at 4am and writes "Pretty girl ;)" I ignore it and assume he was coming home after a tequila bender, or not sure how to use social media. But then, *over a month later*, he corners me in the elevator and says "I saw your photo on LinkedIn. Very pretty," and WINKS at me. I gave him an incredibly bitchy smile, honed through years of sorority chapter meetings, and just said "Aww, that's so sweet, my grandpa said the exact same thing when he saw it."
