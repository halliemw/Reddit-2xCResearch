Consider for a moment that for every person a rape-related image/document upsets, it teaches 10 people what rape is and what it is you become when you do it.

I am sorry that it triggered bad memories for you, but it is necessary for our society to show those images so that we may never repeat those mistakes. If we allowed trigger warnings for everyone, we wouldn't be able to discuss any of the major parts of world history.
