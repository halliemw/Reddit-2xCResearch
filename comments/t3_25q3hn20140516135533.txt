I've been coming back here off and on for a long time. TwoX has always had its share of derailing and mansplaining, and I've always heard complaints about it. BUT, since becoming a default, it's gotten worse. 

I don't want TwoX to NOT be a default though. The fact that it is now is very important to stopping these derailing tactics and making sure that dudebros realise that we have a say, and sometimes, they don't get to. 

In the front page post about rape, it's filled with guys saying "but not all men" or "false accusations are worse than literal rape", when the OP specifically says in her post that she understands that men get raped too, but she wanted the discussion to be about the female perspective. 

This sort of thing is not only not acceptable, it's deplorable and disrespectful. The OP of this post made sure to consider all that might read it, and she had her discussion trampled on by people who had no business discussing in that fashion.
