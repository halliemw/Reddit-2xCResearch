Psst, I think most rational and mature people understand that, and the advice applies regardless of the genders in question. He/She is just more convenient for differentiating in an advisory capacity, so I don't bother to put in a six-page caveat that allows for all the different gender and orientation-based pronouns. 

Why? Because it shouldn't matter if it's good advice. From now on, any time you read advice, I highly suggest you simply take the relevant parts of the advice, and adapt/interpret that pronouns/genders as you prefer. 

You want a cause? Girls and boys under the age of ten are still forced into marriage in certain parts of the world. Children are starving and dying of AIDS in Africa. Being gay (or all the other deviations in the LGBTQetc. spectrum) can get you killed in some parts of the world. 

Considering the above... I kind of find pronoun policing (both of myself and others) to be a very lazy and frivolous pursuit, and I hope you do to.
