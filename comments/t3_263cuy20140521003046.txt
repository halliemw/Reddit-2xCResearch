I never did the dorm thing. I somewhat regret it in that I know I would have made a lot of friends. 

I'm signed up for a sports class next semester, so I'm hoping that'll be good. I feel like that's even lower pressure than club sports, which is basically where I'm at. :) 

I've looked through our clubs for more casual ones that I might be interested in but none really seemed like something I could get into or make friends from. So many are professional. What types of clubs have you made good friends from?
