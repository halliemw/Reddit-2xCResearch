No worries! I have a Makerbot Replicator 2X (Makerbot is kinda like the Apple of 3D printers - less customization but hard to break). I've been printing with ABS plastic only so far, but I hear tell my machine can also handle PLA, nylon and wood. It's not crazy expensive, but it's not exactly a cheap hobby either. A 1kg roll of filament costs about $30-40, although I have been in talks with my favorite brand about wholesale purchasing. I buy everything off Amazon, or my local hardware store.
