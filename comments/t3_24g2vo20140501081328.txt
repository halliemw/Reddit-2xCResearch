I get this way too, my knees are all twisted from an accident when I was younger and I have Keratosis Pilaris on them too ( all red horrible blotches ) I found that just looking at them from a distance, of which a person in the street would see you, you can literally hardly see a difference from anyone else really. I started by using shading techniques with make-up on them first, to hide the red and the weird angles of my knees. I would sometimes also use cooling tights in the summer with a slight tint to them ( darker than my skin tone ) to hide up my legs.
Then one day I went out in a dress totally forgetting to put any makeup on them and without tights, and it just felt so freeing! It took a long long time for me to be okay with my legs, and I was so self conscious for a while. But I took it gradual, using less and less each time and now Ive been makeup free of them for about a year :) It just takes time! And so many congrats on going out fulltime! Must be tough and I bet we are all proud of you here :D
