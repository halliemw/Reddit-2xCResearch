You seem angry. Are you here from /r/all?

I never said that I consider both sides to be equally legitimate. Quite the opposite. However, the legitimacy of either side has literally nothing to do with this conversation. I'm not sure why you keep trying to actively pull the conversation in that direction. Like /u/missachlys pointed out, it's one of those "there's a time and a place" things.
