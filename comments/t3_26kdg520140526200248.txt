Aw. Yeah, there's not really anywhere on the internet you can ensure have no men. If you wanna repost to /r/abrathatfits, I don't think there's as *many* men, since it isn't a default subreddit? Plus they are bra gurus. 

But yeah, reddit is mostly men. Even female-oriented subreddits can have a majority men in them. If you're uncomfortable talking about your boobs here, um, that's really fair actually.
