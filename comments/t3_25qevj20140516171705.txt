> ... your new reality will reward risk taking and failure more than perfection ...

It depends on the profession.  If you're going to be a doctor, precision and perfection are key.  If you're applying to a startup or entrepeneurship, then obviously you'd better be bold and take risks.  

It's not a gender thing. Anyone who thinks quiet and safe is going to keep a start-up alive is terribly wrong.  For example, Hotjobs.com, when they were a startup, spent 50% of their funding on a single Superbowl ad.  It was risky and they exploded into popularity.  

This has nothing to do with men vs women.  It is about people trying out for jobs with misguided mindsets.
