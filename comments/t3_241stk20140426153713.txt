TwoX is, in my opinion, biased towards women who have gone through something negative in their pasts and deliberately looked for a safe space to speak in.

If you act like you belong there - which you do, since the school admitted you! - it'll work out fine. There will always be guys who think you don't belong there because you're a girl, but there's nothing they can do about it. Just don't give a fuck and go ahead and do your awesome science shit! 

I'm in Canada, not the US, and I've not experienced men looking down on me or singling me out in any of my classes or workplaces. RIT is in New York, not a traditionally conservative Southern state. 

Also, I'm going to get on a shitlist for this, but as a general college tip: Be alert when it comes to alcohol and partying. I feel like 80% of the bad college stories on TwoX start with 'I was drinking at a party...' Not saying don't drink or party, but be aware that bad stuff is more likely to happen when doing so.
