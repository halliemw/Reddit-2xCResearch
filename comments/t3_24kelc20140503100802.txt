Islamic fundamentalists aren't really anti-science like Christian fundamentalists in America are.  Their fundamentalism is primarily cultural (i.e., they don't want American movies and music influencing the youth, etc...).  However, scientific discovery was probably negatively impacted by the fact that a lot of really educated people fled the country after the revolution and the government was fine with it because they were "anti-Islam."
