Thank you for the comforting words,

If I were to be honest with myself I have to admit that changes frighten me! Since I was a child, I always had a goal or a plan for my life, I've always been confident in myself, my choices and preferences. Having a crush on a woman was definitely not a part of my plan, I never gave a single thought to this possibility. 

Rationally speaking, I know that sometimes things don't go as planned and yes I agree with what you're saying, yet it's hard to rationalize it and accept it, you know?

Do you advise to figure myself out first before ever trying to do anything about my crush? Or should I go ahead and try something with her? Do you have an idea on how I can figure out if she is interested as well?
