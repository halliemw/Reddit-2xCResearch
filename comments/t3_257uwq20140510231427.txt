Oh, I totally agree.  The male students who are materially affected in test scores by others clothing, if any even exist, need to learn to focus better. 

However, the relevant actor here isn't the male student, it's the school.  The question is whether the school should *also* do something in addition to these hypothetical male students. 

If we presuppose that clothes actually are having a meaningfully negative effect on students' scores, then it seems to me that the importance of education trumps freedom of expression, and clothing rules should be designed and enforced to minimize that effect.

That said, I think where we'd agree is that that presupposition is likely incorrect.  Girl's clothes likely aren't having any real educational affect on any significant sample size of male students.  Thus there is no need for schools to design or enforce such rules.

My last post wasn't intended to defend the existence of the rules, but rather to posit that it's not just a student's problem when the environment of the school is affecting his or her performance (in a meaningful statistical size) - it's also the school's.
