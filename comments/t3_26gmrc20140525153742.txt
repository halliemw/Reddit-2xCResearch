If you actually suspect Asperger's is the main factor here, just constantly remind him that he's violating the rules. I have mild Asperger's, but I hang out with a lot of autistic people (sometimes teach a drama class for special needs adults), and this generally works for me after a few reminders. 

People with autism tend to be a very routine-oriented. He's gotten into the routine of talking to the workers and doing creepy things, so he has trouble stopping that, even though he may know he needs to. However, autistic people are *also* often very rule-oriented, and being reminded several times that he's breaking rules (and maybe told that the rule is for workers' safety) is likely to help correct it. He'll get into a new, less creepy routine.

Of course, that all assumes he's being this way because of autism. It's entirely possible that he's autistic AND CREEPY, and doesn't care about the rules. But this approach has worked for me with problematic peers/students in the past.
