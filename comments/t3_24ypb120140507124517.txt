My wedding cost less than $1k and it was still very special.  What makes a wedding special is the love and the people, not the food/decorations/whatever.  My husband and I had our ceremony on a beach, with no decorations and only 9 guests.  Then we all went out for dinner.  My mom got a cake from Trader Joe's and my husband's parents brought champagne.

All you really need to get married is a license and an officiant.  My JOP cost $150 and the license was $30.  There were cheaper JOPs, but this guy had a great reputation, so we went with him.  The other details are nice, but not necessary.  Your wedding will be special no matter how little it costs, because you're getting married.
