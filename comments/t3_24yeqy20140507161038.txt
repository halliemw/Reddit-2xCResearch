Sorry but I'd say he's acting racist. I guess it's nice he is worried for you. I subbed for awhile at an inner city school in Dallas for a year. Was some of the most humbling experiences of my life. Now I'm a guy but I was treated with a lot of respect and while there was a communication barrier at times we had a lot of fun with it.
