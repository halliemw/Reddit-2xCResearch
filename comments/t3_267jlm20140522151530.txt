You know Oct, that is what I fear.  I think religion can be a beautiful thing and that is coming from someone who considers himself an atheist because I just can't make that leap of faith.  I'm most sad because I know that your friend's path will be extremely similar to mine and there isn't much she can do for it but prepare unless he wakes up and realizes that SHE is real and the well-being and mental stability of their children is REAL.  

That marriage cannot exist if they don't look to each other to make it through life.  Also, think about the decision making process that their children are developing: It's alright, I'll look to the sky and a deity to fix what is too hard to deal with in my life.

I've never done this because this is the internet anonymity is king but if you or your friend would like to contact someone who has LITERALLY JUST FINISHED THIS SAME EXACT BATTLE AND LOST TO GOD. 

The heartbreak is that you're going to be the shoulder while she goes through issues in a sacred bond that don't adhere to any logic that she possesses.  Be patient with her and get used to her asking "Why?"  Because that Octavia9 is all my friends heard and none of them could give me an answer but having them there meant the world to me.
