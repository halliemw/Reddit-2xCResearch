You are about to have your masters and your dad still controls you this way?  I understand your dad is your dad, but YOU are YOURSELF.   That trumps.  You are an adult  (unless you are one of those 15 year old genius college kids)    let your dad know that you need to control your life and that can happen the easy way or the hard way.  Its his choice if he still wants you to be home for holidays or not
