I got pregnant at 20. had my baby at 21. I almost have my Master's Degree in Special Education. My focus is in learning disabilities, but I have spent a great deal of time subbing in "Special Education Behavioral Disorder Classes." 

Many of these kids are gang-bangers, or young parents, or both. Most of the young moms are 14-17 years old. Jesus christ guys, being pregnant at 20 was SO HARD for me. I can't even imagine how much worse it was for a 14-17 year old. Some of these girls astonish me with their parenting skills, and some make me want to cry for their children. I'm Just now (at age 26) feeling like I could handle another child. 

I never EVER regret keeping my child, but had I known what being a parent required, the moment I found out I was pregnant, I would have terminated the pregnancy. 

I'm glad I didn't. I made it through the fire and am better for it. Still, to suggest anyone, teen or not, should keep their unexpected pregnancy, is ludicrous.  The world is full of shitty parents, and shaming them for considering abortion, is setting that child up for YEARS of misery.
