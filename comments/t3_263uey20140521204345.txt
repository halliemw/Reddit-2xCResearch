if i present myself as a consenting sexual partner when in reality i am not a consenting sexual partner than i have raped the person i have had sex with. i have presented myself as someone i am not. this is rape by fraud. 

rape by deception does not require me to dress up as someone's husband. it only requires me to deceive the person i am sleeping with into believing i am someone that i am not. this includes deceiving them into believing that i have given them consent. 

it would be the same if i deceived them into thinking that i was female when in reality i was male. 

it would be the same if i deceived them into thinking i was HIV negative, when in reality i was HIV positive. 

it would be the same if i deceived them into thinking i was a movie producer when in reality i was not and had no ability to further their acting career. 

it would be the same if i deceived a jewish woman into thinking i was jewish when in reality i was not. 

it would be the same if i deceived a prostitute into thinking i was a paying customer when i was not. 

the courts rarely touch this because it would be extremely difficult to prosecute under. generally rape by deception is not prosecuted, but that does not mean that it isn't rape. 

in the future this will be cleared up by mind reading technology that can scan your brain for intentions, and will know with certainty whether you are fabricating events or remembering events. it will also be able to determine if you intended to deceive and if you intended this deception to result in sex that you would otherwise not obtain. 

just because it is hard to prosecute doesn't mean it isn't rape. case in point, the OP's story that we are talking about. i believe that it is more likely that he raped her. but good luck prosecuting that without being able to read his mind.
