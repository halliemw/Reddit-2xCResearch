In the sense that he's also been hurt by the situation, because it's difficult to remain fully supportive and accepting of something that's hurt him, too. However, there's a line. And that line is firm and bold where he's blaming her for getting raped.

I have an ex (and kind of, sort of, a current, ish--it's vastly complicated) who did something to me that caused a severe rape flashback to a previous event. And it broke me, because I had never really dealt with being raped--I was one of those people who thought, if I just bury them deep enough, it'll be like they **never happened,** and everything will be fine.

It wasn't fine. And when everything went wrong with the ex, the first thing he did was say it was my fault for letting him *put* me in that situation. 

Two years of therapy later, I can look (somewhat) objectively at what happened and see how much he was flailing. Something like this had never happened to him before, he thought he had full permission and consent, and *in that* his assumptions were mostly accurate, because I *did not tell him* how much I was affected, and how wrong everything went in that moment. I didn't tell him to stop, I just...shut down. I flatlined. I didn't tell *anyone* what happened, and it screwed me up big-time.

But. His fault began with blaming me for what I experienced. To that line, it's him being hurt, and I understand that. But **over** that line? No. Once he blamed me for it he was **WRONG**.

Once her boyfriend blamed her for this he was **WRONG**. Full stop.
