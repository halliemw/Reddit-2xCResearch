Well I would say that you were open and honest in your discussion of contraception and pregnancy with him and he was...maybe less so.  There's no reason to feel ashamed for having unprotected sex with him.  You're in a committed relationship and had discussed with him that you were going off birth control and that you would be okay with getting pregnant, and if he wasn't then he should wear a condom.  He chose not to wear a condom.  Assuming he has a basic knowledge of how pregnancy works, he knew what could happen from not wearing a condom.  If he was not okay with having a child, he should have expressed this sentiment to you when you first told him you were coming off birth control.  Then the two of you could have made a joint decision about contraception. Even if you're not pregnant you really need to take a step back and examine communication and commitment and how they relate to your relationship.
