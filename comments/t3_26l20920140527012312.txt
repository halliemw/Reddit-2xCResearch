You're allowed to feel however you want to feel, but I agree that this was rape. The absence of a "no" does not mean that there was a "yes." There was no consent. It sounds like you were either too drunk to move and therefore too drunk to give consent or that you were in shock about what was happening. Either way it was rape. 

As for what to do, that's entirely up to you. You can try confronting him about it (in public, with a sympathetic friend with you), report him (I honestly, and sadly don't think that will amount to much, but at least you'll know you tried. I don't want you to feel pressure that you have to feel a certain way about it or do something, but what he did to you was completely wrong. I think you acknowledging that he is to blame and that you are not responsible for this is a good first step.
