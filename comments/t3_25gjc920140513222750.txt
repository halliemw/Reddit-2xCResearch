Honestly, I think he's being immature about it. Sex is blown out of proportion in society, and he's turning something that is in my opinion essential for true emotional bonding between a couple into a martyr for his misplaced values. It's easy to have firm values in the absence of experience.  My teenage self had a lot of strong convictions about the world, but my teenage self also had no idea what the fuck he was talking about. I was mostly just parroting my parents and their value system.  You've had sex and are now abstaining at his request, for this to be a fair argument he needs to agree to have sex once.  If he still feels the same afterwards, then at least he has firm grounds for asking you to wait for something that is obviously important to you.  And btw, fear of pregnancy is just a scapegoat when condoms exist.  (Maybe you can get him to agree to no sex without condoms until marriage? I mean what argument remains at that point that isn't religious?)

Edit: fuck the people who downvoted me.  This comment was a hell of a lot more valid than all of the "you need to respect his wishes" bullshit.  At the very least, this girl needs to question things a bit more than blindly devoting herself to something she doesn't herself believe in at the age of 23.  Whatever reddit.  Whatever.
