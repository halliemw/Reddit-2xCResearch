Yeah no kidding. I hate how people are always praising how wonderful it is, the first time I used it, pulling it out was horrible. Folding it up wasn't possible because it was too wet and I couldn't reach that far. Worst pain I'd ever felt and I have a pretty high tolerance. Since I was a virgin it tore my hymen.
