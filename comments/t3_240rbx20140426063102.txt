I would focus on figuring out whether you want one without hormones (Paragard, copper, lasts 10 years) or with (Mirena, levonorgestrel, lasts 5 years/Skyla, same drug but slightly lower dose, lasts 3 years). If you decide you want to have kids sooner or just plain don't like it and want to try something else, you can have it removed at any time.

The biggest difference between copper and hormonal IUDs, besides how long they last, is that the copper IUD tends to make your periods heavier while many women with the hormonal IUD stop having periods or find that they lighten considerably.

Skyla is being marketed towards younger women as I believe it may be slightly smaller, but putting something through your cervix isn't going to be super fun regardless of what you choose. I preferred the 5 year period of the Mirena and went with that in my early 20s. I'm very glad I did!

For insertion, your doctor can prescribe a medication that helps make your cervix easier to dilate, and some doctors will even numb it for the procedure. Having a doctor who does a lot of insertions really helps - it wasn't fun during, but I had zero cramping or bleeding once mine was in.
