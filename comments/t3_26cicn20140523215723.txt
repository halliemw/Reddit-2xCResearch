Actually we met through an ex-friend of mine, who just so happened to be his ex-girlfriend as well.  She thought that we would make good friends and it kind of just took of from there.  4 hour long phone conversations, we were LD for a couple of years there so the phone was our best friend as well as skype and google hangouts. Also a monthy weekend trip and time spent over vacations from school.  He is a student and I was working in a Uni library so the off times between the semesters were ideal for spending longer amounts of time together. 

I moved in with him 6 months ago and we have been so happy finally getting to live with each other and learning to be together.  We have a cute mixed breed dog together, we are one happy little family.
