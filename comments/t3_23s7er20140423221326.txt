I'm with you. I've been at super packed shows where it became dangerous whenever a crowd surfer would come past because it basically caused the entire crowd to fall over. It was so crowded that my feet weren't touching the ground at some points of the show. Another time people spent the entire show turned around since it was just crowdsurfer after crowdsurfer. It was pretty shitty. I understand crowdsurfing to get out because of the need for an emergency exit though.
