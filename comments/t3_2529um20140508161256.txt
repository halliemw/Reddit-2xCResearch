Sometimes... when you meet someone in person they don't look as good. It's kind of weird. There is a reverse too, where people look terrible in photos, and look better in person.

I am very sorry that he couldn't just be honest about it, I'm not sure why the sex happened if he found you repulsive. But confidence comes from you. It can take a battering from other people, but you know you're not repulsive, so just believe it :)

You'll find someone who thinks you're gorgeous!
