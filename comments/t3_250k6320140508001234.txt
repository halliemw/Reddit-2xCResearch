I feel like 3d printers are still deeply flawed (because they cannot yet print out tings made up of complex ingredients/designs etc), but give it 30 years and they will change the world.  Maybe they will make consumerism more 'democratic', so that things can be made cheaper, individuals can have more control over their production, and people can maybe avoid the effect that the advertising industry has on one's self esteem and self worth.
