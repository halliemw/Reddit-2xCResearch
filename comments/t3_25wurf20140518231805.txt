So I am not sure where you live (Meetup in rural areas pretty much sucks), but as a longtime user of Meetup, I would like to offer some advice for getting the most out of the site.

A.) Don't join groups that have applications. Unless its for some incredibly niche networking group, there's no need for applications. I have also found that groups that try to be exclusive upfront are usually the worst run.

B.) If you aren't finding what you want, start your own group. I recently started my own group and it's so nice to finally run things they way I have always wanted to. Totally worth the extra work that organizing requires.

C.) When you do physically attend a meetup, think of it as a low risk, low intensity way to meet new people to have friendships outside of the group. Make an effort to find out about people and if you get along, plan to do other stuff together. Waiting for the next Meetup is not really all that conducive to a real friendship.

D.) Depending on your interests, you will likely get a lot of weird, weird people at your meetups. But overwhelmingly, they are also very nice people. So swallow that discomfort and pride, and just talk to everyone. You will probably be surprised at what you learn about your fellow group members.
