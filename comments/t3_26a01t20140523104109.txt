I'm sorry, but this is an absolutely awful thing to say. First of all being bullied can absolutely ruin your life, as it does to many people. Feeling hurt by what bullies say to you does not make you weak, it does not mean you will go off the rails and get pregnant at 15, nothing like that. It is an entirely healthy response to feel upset when people intentionally hurt you.

Secondly, not all bullying is due to jealousy, especially not at 13. Bullies bully because they can. Because nobody tells them not to, because they enjoy the reactions they get, because nobody has ever properly taught them the concept of empathy. Telling a little girl "They're just jealous" isn't helpful at all - you risk making her hate herself even more, and think it's her fault that she is bullied, and wish that she wasn't who she was. This can completely destroy someone.

I know you probably mean well, but a) bullying is not 'normal' and we should not allow it to be considered 'normal', it is awful, and b) it is never ever a good thing to be bullied no matter what the circumstance.
