Every 12 hours for me ,too. I usually empty it in the morning in the shower and then one more time before bed. Even on my heaviest days I don't have any leakage problems.  With a tampon, I was always accidentally peeing on the string and then having to change it before it needed to be changing. Ugghhh...that horrible feeling of tugging out a dry tampon.
