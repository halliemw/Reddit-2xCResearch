It's a place of extremes, can't possible meet in the middle. People I met were either super lovely or complete cunts. Things were either super cheap or ridiculously expensive. Also felt trapped a bit there, more violence, armed police and no go areas, just felt like everything I said would really offend someone. Also my favorite colour is orange(I have lots of orange clothes), yeah not a good choice. I only lived there for a month for work, never again.

I like Northern's far more, you get the whole spectrum.
