> We are teaching girls that their virginity makes them special. But we're also sending the wrong message â€“ that without their virginity, they're damaged goods

I'm sorry, I don't see how the 2nd sentence follows from the first.  It's theoretically possible to teach girls that virginity is preferable without making them think they are "damaged goods" without it.  If there is a criticism to be made here, it is more for the actual practical application of these concepts rather than the abstract notions underlying the concept. 

Also, this is a bizarre kind of feminism - feminism is supposed to be about choice, yet they are attacking the personal choices these people are making.
