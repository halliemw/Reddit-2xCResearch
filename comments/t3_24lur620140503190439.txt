If they internalized the idea that their race/gender was intellectually inferior, why would they take a career in academia? Black children who grow up thinking they're ugly don't choose to be actors and models. In fact if they believed themselves inferior to their peers, they would have performed worse in any tests they took anyway and wouldn't have become professors. That's what internalization means.
