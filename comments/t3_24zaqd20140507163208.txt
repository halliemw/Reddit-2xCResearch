IUDs [aren't correlated with BV](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22337109) but irregular bleeding is.

Having an IUD [isn't considered a predisposing factor for a yeast infection](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782408000565), however the strings of your IUD could act as a reservoir for the organisms causing the infection. So while it may seem like it "goes away" it may actually not. In this case, removal of the IUD would likely prevent recurrence. 

There's maybe some [evidence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001078247990009X) that nickel allergies could cause reactions to IUDs, but this study is really quite old and isn't so conclusive. I wasn't able to find anything more recent, but you might have better luck.

Changes to diet/weight, stress etc can all interfere with your period. 

I think this is one of those cases where you should arm yourself with knowledge and talk with your doctor about your concerns.
