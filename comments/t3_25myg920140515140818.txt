This may be a cliched response but you may need to find the contraceptive that works for you. 

In the past I was on two different types of combined contraceptive pill which both gave me horrendous side effects including mood swings, permanent nausea and massively decreased sex drive (which probably led to an additional messed up natural lubrication). This put me off hormonal birth control for a few years, but, like yourself, my heavy and painful periods led me to seek out alternatives. I tried a progesterone only tablet for a while which worked well asides from leading to a permanent, albeit light, period. I'm now on a different kind of combined contraceptive pill and have been for 5 months, with very few side effects (possibly some mood swings but nowhere near as severe). 

In addition, it's worth noting that some women find non-hormonal methods can aid problematic periods (for example the IUD). Try Aleese for a couple of months and see how it works for you. In all honesty considering that heavy flow you have it sounds like the best option. Best of luck.
