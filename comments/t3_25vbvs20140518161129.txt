Every dress will sacrifice something.  The column-like design of your dress is something that only a few women can wear well and you wear it well.  Narrowing dresses down to what we can personally wear well is already hard - you did that.  

There are certainly dresses that are stripped of some of the elements you chose, but they look like evening gowns and not wedding dresses.  Part of the game is to wear a dress that looks like a wedding dress, something a lot of us feel uncomfortable about.  Your friend is pretty insensitive, btw.
