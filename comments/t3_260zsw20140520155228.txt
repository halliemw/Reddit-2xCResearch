Thats what I just said. I said if it changes behavior. A fitness trainer and a couch potato is the same exact thing that I was describing. I dont see it as a political view, its a way to live life (and political views can also be ways to live life as I said) However, there are many people that are not Christian that live life by the same general principals that Christians do such as loving and respecting everyone. I think your perception of what non-Christians are is askew.
