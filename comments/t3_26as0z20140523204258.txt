So I know this sub is mostly women oriented but I just want to say that as a son you hit the nail on the head. Whenever I ask my mom how to do X I'm simply told to "figure it out". She just assumes I know her routine in and out when in reality I don't. If I hand wash something that could have gone in the dishwasher, then so be it! If I do a task a different way and it takes longer but I get the same end result, so be it! If you want me to do things a certain way then tell me rather than assuming it's common knowledge. Spoiler alert: for a lot of men it isn't. She's been doing chores for years. I haven't. As a result I don't bother helping out much just so I don't get ridiculed for doing something either differently or incorrectly. Hopefully my future wife and I are good at communicating. :p
