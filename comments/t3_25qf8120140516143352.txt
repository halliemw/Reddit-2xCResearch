Awesome.  I knew I was walking the line on a few things so I wasn't sure.  I know this is a sub based around respect and support, and that is one thing I think twoXers can be amazing at, the empathy to care about another like a parent would a child.  I didn't want to belittle this being a safe haven for twoXers (sadly less and less these days) yet in many ways I feel I belong.
