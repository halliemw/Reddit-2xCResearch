Oh man, I've only done it once. I'm PARANOID about it. If I notice that the bag of rolls is half empty, or if they go on sale even if I have a mostly full bag, I need to buy it. 

I mean, I have tissue paper and paper towel and stuff in the house. It's not like it is the end of the world if I run out, but I NEED to have at least 6 rolls in the house to not worry about it. I went down to TWO ROLLS last week because I haven't seen them on sale, and yeesh, when I noticed that I needed to run out and grab some.
