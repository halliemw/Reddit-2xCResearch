Nah I totally understand, thanks for your input!

I talked with my boyfriend about what he thought about the change and he worries because he thinks some guys will downvote stuff that they think is gross/doesn't relate to them. We also agree that this will help smaller, more specific subreddits rise and flourish. For instance I just found out /r/birthcontrol exists thanks to the sidebar, which is way better for my post. 

I don't know about removing the post, but notifying the OP that there is a more specific subreddit sounds like a good idea, as long as it's active.
