I think there's a difference between "He stopped drinking" and "He says he will stop drinking."  How long has it been since he's drank before that night? Does he usually drink? Does he have any other problems with drinking? Does he understand that he did that and he will never drink again?  If he absolutely will never drink again, then maybe give him a chance. But if there's other patterns of behavior here or other red flags get out now.
