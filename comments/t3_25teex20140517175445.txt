I don't have PCOS, but I am a person with chronic depression who uses hormonal birth control and anti-depressants.

As far as I know there's no direct interaction between hormonal birth control and anti-depressants in terms of one causing problems with absorption of the other or anything. I've taken several different anti-depressants while on BC and I read my medication information thoroughly, and there has never been any mention of issues between them, nor have I experienced unplanned pregnancy.

When it comes to birth control and mood changes, I have had some issues there. When I tried the birth control patch it made me feel uncontrollably upset--it was so bad I couldn't even make it through a whole month. Other formulations (two types of pills, the ring) haven't given me the same problem. I'm on the ring now and have been very satisfied with the lack of side effects. Different formulations can definitely affect people differently in a dramatic way, so keep trying different approaches with your doctor and hopefully one of them will work out better for you.

Going on both antidepressants and birth control at the same time might be tough just because it would be hard to figure out which thing is giving you side effects. Many antidepressants lower libido (an issue that caused me to change to a different antidepressant), and so can BC. BC can cause nausea (an issue that made me change BC types once), and so can some antidepressants. Unless your doctor says otherwise, it might be best to work on one of the types of medication first until you're satisfied with a formulation and dose, and then work on the other.

Anyway, I wish you the best of luck with finding some options that work well for you.
