I mean it's either a system of support or it's a system of justice. And as for not wanting someone who raped you to be punished... That's a really weird gray area I don't really want to get into. It would seem to me that if it were a vile coercion of sex against consent, it would make for a more obvious decision, but what do I know? I think it's unfair for us as a society to ask universities to play both these roles AND be critical of them if we can't even agree on the standard procedure that they should follow... That's why we have law enforcement.
