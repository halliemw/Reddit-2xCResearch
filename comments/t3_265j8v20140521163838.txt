>He says he doesn’t, because all I do is reply that I’m not pretty. 

That's your problem. It's incredibly annoying to tell someone they're attractive then hear them say "No I'm not." If he didn't think you were pretty, he wouldn't have complimented you (or married you) in the first place. I understand you might not *feel* pretty when he compliments you, but you need to learn to bite back your initial reaction and just smile and thank him for the compliment. It'll make you both feel happier-- him because his compliment is being accepted graciously and not just pushed away, and you because I think you'll find that if you stop calling yourself 'not pretty' you're going to begin to feel prettier.
