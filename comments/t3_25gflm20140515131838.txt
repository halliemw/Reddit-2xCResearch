I can see how some people might feel that way. My take away is that the thought process of "why not me" implies its an external force you are powerless against.  Successfully living is, to sound like Tony Robins, creating excellence in your life, in all aspects.  It comes from within.  Its a lot more of an evolved mature attitude than you will find in highschool. 

You know, I had no idea this conversation would go so far.  I thought my comment was at best insightful and at worst innocuous.  Live and learn.  All the best noodles, I really mean that (this time and before).
