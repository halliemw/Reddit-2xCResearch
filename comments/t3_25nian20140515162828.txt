My responsibility is for my family first and everyone else second.  It's hard enough to try and instill good values in a child with all these negative outside influences.   I've seen how the "herd" mentality works.  When one person does something, particularly if they're a friend or someone everything thinks is cool, then it removes the stigma.  It becomes socially acceptable and others follow in their footsteps.  

Now, there are two schools of thought on what contributes most in a persons development; nature and nurture.  The child of alcoholic, presumably "bad", parents most likely have both covered.  I'm not saying wearing short shorts makes someone a hoochie, but it's not helping in this kids case and I didn't say she is a hoochie.  I'm just saying that I wouldn't condone their relationship.  

I once heard a comedian say something along the lines of: If you're a black man walking down the street and you see a group of bald men coming the other way, don't worry about what other people think.  Don't say, "I wonder if they're a cancer support group".  Just move to the other side and be safe.  

These "bad" kids might not negatively influence my child, but I'd rather play it safe.
