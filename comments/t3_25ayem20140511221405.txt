There is a blood test that can be done that will give you a general idea of how much "time" you have left to have children.  AMH, [anti-Mullerian hormone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-M%C3%BCllerian_hormone), measures [ovarian reserve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_reserve).   It's just now beginning to be used by reproductive endocrinologists.  Normally antral follicle count is used to confirm AMH results.  This is because women with PCOS will have high AMH due to all the cysts on their ovaries, even when they're older and have diminished ovarian reserve.  

From what I understand, AMH is one of the "hot" topics in fertility research.  If you are infertile, it's usually one of the first tests done.  If your AMH comes back low, fertility treatments may be accelerated to give you a better chance of conceiving.

Another blood test can be run to give you some indication of how much "time" you have left to bear children.  Elevated FSH, follicle stimulating hormone, may indicate poor quality eggs.  Poor quality eggs might fertilize, but they may fail to divide.  Even if they divide, they may fail to implant.  However, normal FSH at an older age may still not be indicative of good quality eggs.  

At the end of the day, to answer the question, "How long can you wait to have a baby?", I'll defer to my reproductive endocrinologist's answer -- "No one has a crystal ball."
