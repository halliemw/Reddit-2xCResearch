Yeah. . .
That's something that I was hoping wouldn't happen. I guess it's kind of inevitable with the internet. There's such a broad range of opinions that it's hard to carry on a constructive conversation without someone feeling targeted/targeting.

This isn't really a man vs. woman thing in my intention. I was more looking for some advice from women who have more experience with men than I do since I don't have very much experience with the dating aspect of it all.
