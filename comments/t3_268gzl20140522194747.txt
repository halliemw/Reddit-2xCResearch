I have only used Paragard.  I used it for 3 months and then had it removed.  Insertion is very painful.  I have very a painful and heavy period when not using birth control.  The amount of blood I had using the Paragard was ridiculous.  I've been having my period for a long time, I am not afraid of blood.  If I was in a public restroom I would have to wait for it to empty before I left the stall to wash my hands.  It was way too much blood for witnesses!  I was very nauseated during my cycle and the cramps were close to debilitating.  Crawl up with a heating pad and roll around style.  Getting it removed hurt much less than insertion though.  I wouldn't recommend it.
