The chemical that the body makes for itself during the luteal phase of the cycle and for the duration of a pregnancy is called Progesterone. 

Progestins are basically 'imitation Progesterone', or 'fake progesterone'. Imitation crab meat is NOT made with crab, Orange Drink is NOT made with oranges, and neither are Progestins identical to Progesterone USP (a lab-made chemical that is the same as what the body makes for itself). 

> So Marvelon and Lunabell would pretty much be the same thing because Norethisterone and Desogestrel are both just types of progestin?

'Progestin' refers to a class of chemicals which are sort-of similar to Progesterone. The different progestins are like the difference between orange crush, orange drink, tang, orange gatorade, etc. These are all orange-colored and probably have sugar, but none of them are made from oranges.
