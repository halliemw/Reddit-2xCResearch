>I would think most people, if they took the time to really explore that concept would find that at our core, we really don't.

I agree with you that having human DNA doesn't automatically make you valuable or worthy of rights, but I disagree that most people would feel that way.

I think most would still acknowledge that a fetus matters at least a little, even if its life or rights do not equate to a person's.

Self-preservation is a pretty strong instinct, and it extends out to our species to some extent.
