I think a lot of my friends (and myself) who have struggled with depression first noticed it around this age. I wish someone had talked to me about it in a general and non-scary way. I think if it had been mentioned without stigma earlier in my life I wouldn't have waited so long to talk to a professional about it. Brain chemistry is super interesting even if you aren't having trouble with yours, and it might help some of them recognize issues in their friends too.
