It seems like hair is making a comeback (at least on men).  Not too long ago, clean shaven and hairless men were the popular standard of male attractiveness.  In the 70's and 80's, it was all about chest hair.  Then, in the 90's and 00's, a hairless chest and stomach (and a clean shaven face) was considered most attractive.  Lately, though, it very much seems like beards and body hair are coming back into vogue.

This stuff seems to cycle.
