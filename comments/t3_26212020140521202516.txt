>we're very wary of the long-term effects that being a default might bring

My problem is that I'm not seeing this. The mods might actually feel that way, but it isn't transparent at all. I think a lot of people feel like their safe-space was hijacked without ever having had their opinion asked. I was under the impression that this was a community of people working together. What I feel it actually is now is a group of people making decisions without ever consulting the community. It was never put to the community to discuss whether or not default status was a good idea. I have yet to see a poll that would gauge how subscribers to the subreddit actually feel. Instead we're being told what to do. 

I don't think there's any amount of policing by the mods that will help this situation. This is no longer a safe space for many, many readers. At the very least, a poll of the community should have been done BEFORE default status was put in place. As it stands now, there is no way to take that poll because of the influx of new readers. Honestly, I'm just incredibly, incredibly disappointed in the way this was handled.

EDIT: Wanted to add that some of the anger and frustration that people are expressing about the switch to default comes from a sense of betrayal. And we've gotten no apology, no admittance that this wasn't handled well, no attempt to backtrack to non-default status(at least not that I've seen.) This is what many subscribers to the sub are looking for and are extremely frustrated that they haven't seen. We were betrayed by the very people we trusted to keep this a safe space.
