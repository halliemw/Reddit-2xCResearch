Did they give you a medical term to describe the lump you felt, other than "dense tissue" ? For example, a benign lump could be called fibroadenoma. 
I have a lump in each breast, both which have been ultrasounded on separate occasions and determined to be benign. 
There is breast cancer in my family history so I make sure to keep an eye (or hand) on them, which is really the best thing you can do, unless you desire to hear a different doctors opinion. However, if you're feeling prolonged pain (or change) in the lump, a doctors visit would not be a bad idea.
