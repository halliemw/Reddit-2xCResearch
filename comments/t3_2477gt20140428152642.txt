Snoring is actually a major cause of discord in relationships - there are some studies on this. My boyfriend snores intensely - like if you heard this noise coming out of a cave in the woods, you would RUN. I've gotten good at sleeping through it on a normal night - on bad nights, I will wake up 4 or more times in the night and am so tired that I am just frustrated and angry and exhausted in the morning. He was frustrated with how upset I was - he's not doing it on purpose (obviously) and he doesn't know when he's doing it. So there was some tension there. He was not really looking into options, so I bought nose strips - which didn't work. And then finally found mouth guards for snoring - which he doesn't love but are pretty effective and he wears pretty regularly. (Definitely some give and take here - I wore mouth guards when I was on meds that made grind my teeth.)

So some of this may be that he feels like you're criticizing him for something he can't control - which is frustrating all around. (My bf didn't want to go to the doctor either.) See if you can talk to him about it emphasizing that it's not an issue of blame, you just want to be able to actually SLEEP with him.  And if he's willing to try it - the mouthguard my boyfriend uses is called Puresleep, but there's a bunch of different brands of these.

There just may be some communication failure with this issue - and it may be worth sorting out! Good luck.
