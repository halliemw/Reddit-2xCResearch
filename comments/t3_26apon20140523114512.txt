I'm doing my best to stay positive, but yesterday definitely was not a great day for me. I appreciate your kind words.

With that vaccine, the efficacy is really difficult to determine because HPV doesn't always manifest itself with any kind of noticeable symptoms. Moreover, it gives immunity against the strains that are most likely to cause cervical cancer. Again, difficult to prove efficacy there. But it was a smart decision on your part. :)
