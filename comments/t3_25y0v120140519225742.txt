Yeah... This isnt the first time my period decided to do something stupid at a bad time so I'm a lot calmer now about things like this then i used to be (17 now, lost my virginity at 15) but i JUST broke up with my fiance a few weeks ago and the only time id had sex in that cycle was right after i dumped him (shit happens) so.... I really needed to not be pregnant. So i got a test this time.
