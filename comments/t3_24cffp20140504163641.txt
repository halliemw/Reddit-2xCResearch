i don't think you'd made many comments for me to look through when i posted a few days ago. and by the way, i didn't mean to insinuate that you weren't at all upset about losing your reproductive ability. from your post, it seemed like you're distressed about it but not "my life is over" kind of distressed.

i don't understand why you think it's "sad"  that for some women, their #1 life goal is to have children. it may not be the case for you, but it seems like you think less of them for that and i don't feel that's fair. i don't support them projecting that desire onto you, but i also don't support judging people based on their choices.

anyway, i'm truly sorry if i offended you with my original comment. i wasn't trying to.
