Actually, since this story came out, I've been a little shocked to find out how many people apparently didn't know that extreme weight loss results in this sort of loose skin (at BEST -- most people who lose half that amount of weight have much, MUCH more and worse skin afterward). I mean, there are lots of people saying that they watch The Biggest Loser regularly and never realized that the 'losers' are forced to wear compression garments for that reason, and/or know that they are often secretly whisked off to have major cosmetic surgery before 'reappearing'.
