Men are taught that if you give up too easily, not only did you not care about her, but you don't deserve her and that's the exact reason she rejected you.

To be fair, there are ways to be "persistent" without being creepy or mysoginistic about it. As in, how one is persistent in maintaining relationships with people in general (talking a lot, bonding, resolving conflicts, etc.) if you do care about a person you should try to make things work out (this includes family and friends), but obviously if they don't want what you want at all you need to respect their decision and not constantly bother them about it unless you know their mind has changed.
