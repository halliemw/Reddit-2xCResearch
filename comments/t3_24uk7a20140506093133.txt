I'm so thankful, she stood with me and waited until my friend came to me. She told me not to walk home alone, basically just helped me. I hugged her and thanked her. 

I'm not sure. I assumed it was an actual taxi because theres a taxi lane where they all line up to take people home. I'm worried I won't be believed because I was drunk and was talking about sex (with my friend) so I'm worried they'll say I bought it on myself.
