When we first started dating I started my period one of the first nights I came over to his house. We didn't realize it until the morning when there was blood all over his sheets and bed fluff. He had to throw a bunch of it away and I felt really terrible. But rather than being mad he just said "I'm willing to accept the fact that you are a normal human with normal human body functions" and was all sweet to me. I swooned so hard that day despite the deep internal cringe.
