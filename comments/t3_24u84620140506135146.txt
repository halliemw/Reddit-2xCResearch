Well, I mean you're entitled to your opinion. But you've got to understand that there are two different kinds of boring in play here. *Lots* of people -- lay people and comic fans, including myself love Superman, but concede that it's hard to write for a character who is morally perfect and all powerful, but he's got a lot going for him that makes him worthy of film treatment.

Not a whole lot of folks love Wonder Woman, because she isn't a very well-developed character, doesn't have any good villains, doesn't have any good stories, has a fairly boring mythology, is also morally perfect and very powerful. I just don't see why Wonder Woman in particular deserves a film. There are a few other great female characters who are more deserving. I would make a Black Canary film WAY before a Wonder Woman film. At least she has a personality. Or a Stargirl film. Shit, I would make a Big Barda movie before I made a Wonder Woman movie.
