Welcome to our world!  We spend a lot of time thinking/talking about the physical transitions, but to me, this is one of the major aspects of being female.

In graduate school, I was told to tell another graduate student that she would be "taken more seriously" if she stopped wearing nail polish and learned to speak in a lower tone of voice.  She didn't comply, and she didn't get people on her dissertation committee that were known as the "powerhouses" in the department.  

Recently, in a private conversation, a man who only met me about two months ago, told me that he had a hard time believing anyone would not take my explanations seriously (he's a black man, and he said he's having trouble with people taking him seriously in his nearly all-white workplace).  And I realized that my longterm interest in rhetoric (and some really excellent role models) had helped me establish myself as credible.  It's taken years.

It would be a great topic for a separate thread (one man once told me to "adjust my tie" if the students wouldn't quiet down at the beginning of class; did he really momentarily forget my gender??)
