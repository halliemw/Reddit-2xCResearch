It's nobody's fault that you're unhappy, but it doesn't sound like he's doing much to help you, and that is his fault.  Tell him that you need him to be more active in his support.  Tell him specific things that you want him to do, like going running.  I know he's trying to further his career, but that doesn't mean he can just stop being a husband.
