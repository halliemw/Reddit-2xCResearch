Yes!

Also guys going, "shhh, shhh."  Maybe I'm warped because it seems to exist in so many rape scenes from movies (recent example: Sunday's *Game of Thrones*) but it's super hot.  So affectionate kink where the woman is stressed and whimpering from pain or fear or something, and the dude shushes her nice and slowly... yes.
