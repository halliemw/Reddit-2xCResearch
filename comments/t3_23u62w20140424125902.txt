All those articles really pointed out is that doctors need to improve their informed consent (which I fully agree with). I suspect that fully informed, many people would still choose to go through with screening because the risks associated with cancer are generally higher than the risks associated with it not being cancer. It also supported some cancers like colorectal and cervical, the latter having  the common STD HPV associated with it. 

Let me phrase it another way. You have two options, both of which are at zero cost to you thanks to the country OP lives in.

1) get a routine check up, a small pre-cancerous skin lesion is found and removed a few weeks later. Doctors can never be sure if it would develop into full-blown melanoma. The procedure was a little painful, but overall you only missed half a day of work.

2) you finally go to the doctor after several months of terrible headaches and abdominal pain - cancer that started out as a simple removable skin lesion has metastasized to the brain and liver. 

My point here is that when you have the option to go and get looked over - why wouldn't you? General physicians also look for and help with far more things than just deadly illnesses. At OP's age the only cancer they'd be keeping an eye out for is cervical anyway, which is one of the cancers that benefits very highly from early screening. They're someone who keeps up-to-date with your medical history and observes any patterns that may start to crop up. They're someone who (at least at my doctor's office) screens for any new mental health symptoms that should be addressed. There is no downside to going into see a GP once every couple years. There are many downsides with never going.
