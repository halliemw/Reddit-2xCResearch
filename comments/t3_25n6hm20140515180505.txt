It's not a compliment. It's uncalled for and rude. If you want to compliment a person, don't yell from a moving vehicle or from across the street. Don't yell at all! Catcalling isn't limited to 'compliments' or to attractive women. Catcalling is harassment. It is degrading. 

Catcalling can be terrifying for women. I have been catcalled while out jogging and it escalated to the point where I was running away *in fear* because the men in the vehicle said they wanted to rape me.
