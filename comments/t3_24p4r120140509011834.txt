Minus the hypothyroidism, my story sounds a lot like yours. I basically ignored the fact that I'm overweight, and now feel like I don't recognize myself in mirrors anymore. I'm starting to track what I eat, but know that I have a long way (80 lbs) to go until I reach my goal weight. I think I'll head on over to /r/loseit to get some support and be supportive of others who are in my boat.
