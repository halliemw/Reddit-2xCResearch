He didn't explicitly say he was okay with a happy accident, at least not that you wrote. It sounds as though he was just either being lazy or irresponsible by not wearing a condom. But you should have talked to him explicitly about the possibility of kids. And if he said he didn't want them (sounds like he doesnt) then it is still the responsibility of both parties to make sure to use protection.
