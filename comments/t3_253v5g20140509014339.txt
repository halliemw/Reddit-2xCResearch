Oh no, it's ok. You don't sound like a smartass or anything, I don't think I was taking this as seriously as I should be :( Both my parents are in the medical field and outside of getting vaccinations and stuff like that I never really got taken to the doctor, let alone the hospital except once for a severe burn. They kind of shoved it in my head that the ER is for people with broken bones, trauma and people near death.
