Here's mine to my sister who I haven't spoke to or seen in 2+ years:

When you call my boyfriend racial slurs, it makes me feel extremely embarrassed by your ignorance. 

Honestly it doesn't even hurt my feelings because she makes so many assumptions about someone she has never even met based on his race alone. Sisters can be the best friends and allies you can ever have. Or they can be so awful you can't imagine how you're possibly related to that person.
