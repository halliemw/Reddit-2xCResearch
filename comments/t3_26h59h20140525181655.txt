Also bad advice will kill a supply. Many professionals will give bad advice, so its hard to escape. Unless you have a condition like IGT/tubular breasts, or PCOS you should be able to have a successful breastfeeding relationship. When you are pregnant get in contact with your local La Leche League. Go to meetings. Read The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, and if you run into trouble contact a lactation consultant. 

Many women often think they have a low supply because breastfed babies nurse often. Way more often than a formula fed baby. The first 3 months will feel like all you do is breastfeed and that is totally normal. 

Anyway dont worry about it, make sure you get good information, and try your best.
