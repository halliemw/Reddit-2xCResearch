I've definitely had those moments. I'd be surprised if anyone hadn't. Try thinking about the things you do like about yourself - not visible things, but things you know you're good at, or positive traits you have. Remind yourself that you are important just because you are a PERSON, if nothing else. There are 7 billion people on the planet with vastly different personalities and taste in who they are looking for as a partner. I guarantee you that even if you don't feel that you fit the narrow definition of "beauty" our society affords us, there are still hundreds of people out there who would find you beautiful, inside and out. Hope this helps!
