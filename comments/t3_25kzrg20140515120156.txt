Wow!  That is really low!!  Did you feel really shitty at all?  I felt tired, but not debilitating at all that I couldn't function, but my workouts were very hard though.  How are you doing right now?  How much can an iron infusion get you up? I heard those are very expensive, about $5000 a treatment?
