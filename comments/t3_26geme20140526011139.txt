Hmm... how would you react if someone asked you "so, why did you get so stupid?  or why did you get so lazy?  or why did you get so ugly?"

Those questions are (1) not useful to actually have a conversation around, and (2) deliberately provoking.

I would have responded with "Why have you gotten to be such an asshole?"  Because that question is pure asshole.
