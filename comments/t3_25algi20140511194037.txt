This sounds kinda positive to me, which makes me less worried in a way. 
I do get checked on my thyroid hormone levels all the time and the last time I did, which was in february everything seemed completely fine. Though, that doesn't mean it still is, so I will check on that again. 
Getting all the information from the doctors here might be a problem, since they don't really collect much info haha. Every patient has a card and there's a tiny bit written on it. I didn't get any scans or anything else than that.
I will have to book a one way flight for now and I know it's gonna take a little longer, but I got time.
Thanks a lot for your answer, it gave me a little more strength to get through all this.
