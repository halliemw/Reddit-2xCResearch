I wasn't saying it was guilting, just that for some of us we hear this advice constantly, already feeling shitty that we stayed for so long. 

Like I said, I agree with the sentiment. You and all of us do deserve better, it's true. No one ever deserves abuse and I wish more of us got out sooner. 

I'm really sorry you went through that too. And appreciate the clarification. I apologize for being somewhat brusque, I intended to add to what you said rather than argue and do get defensive on reddit for reasons I'm sure you're familiar with.
