Just about one of the worst environments for this sort of thing!  

I would bring a couple zip loc bags full of wet wipes.  I would do this anyway actually.    They're great for quick bathing.  

I'd bring a sturdy plastic bowl and some wash clothes too.  Boil water in a metal container then pour it into the bowl with a drop of rinseless soap then you can wash up without using a lot of water.   You can also repeat the process to wash the wash clothes and make sure they're sanitized afterwards.   

Not sure how much wood you'll have available but for a long trip, I'd build a little fire and burn any non-plastic trash, period stuff included.  No sense lugging it around the whole time.   Beats burying it too, as animals tend to dig that sort of stuff up and scatter it everywhere.
