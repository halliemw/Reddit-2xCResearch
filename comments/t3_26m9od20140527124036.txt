My sex drive gradually lowered on the oral contraceptive so I asked my dr for something else.. got prescribed the nuvaring as a lower dose of hormones. My sex drive disappeared completely and I felt like shit.

Did a bit of research and it turns out that while oral contraceptives might have a higher dose on the packet, a lot is broken down in your digestive system so the amount that reaches your blood is quite low... lower in fact than when the hormones are delivered vaginally e.g. by the nuvaring, which results in a higher amount of contraceptive chemicals in your blood.

I ditched all hbc altogether and my sex drive arrived. I was suddenly aware of men again even though I'd never noticed I'd stopped noticing them. I was aware of my sexuality.
