It's also a huge conflict of interest.  What is in the best interest of the University is not even remotely what's in the best interests of the victim or alleged perpetrator.

For the University, the best outcome is a swift decision, kept out of the public.  This often means a rush to judgement, most often dismissing the allegations of the victim, but sometimes summary judgement against the alleged attacker.  Neither is a good way to end in justice, and neither is a good way to raise awareness and create a conversation on campus about sexual assault.

Thus why we have 1 in 5 women sexually assaulted at some point during their time in higher education.
