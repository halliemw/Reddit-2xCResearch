I hope you feel better. It might be good (continue) to talk to a therapist, counselor or friend about your experience. You can't change the past so it's important that you accept what happened. 


I'm sorry more people weren't there to support you as much as you like. The decision to get an abortion should always be the woman's decision and it's too bad that you felt pressured into it or that it wasn't something you wanted.
