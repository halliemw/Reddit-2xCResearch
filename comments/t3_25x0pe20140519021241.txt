well, I had sex for the first time with my first boyfriend at the age of 24, and it's because I'm just awkward and picky, not that I'm religious, that I waited so long. so I feel you on this OP, I feel you. 

I think it's better to frame it as "I am totally into you and I want to play with your junk, but I have no idea what I'm doing, so if I am manhandling your penis, you need to tell me" say this at some point when you two are rolling around together on a couch or a meadow or something. 

frame it as "I am new at this and I want to try it out" and don't just straight into P in V intercourse, and be sure to use protection.

that said, I found myself in that relationship giving a lot more orgasms than I received. it's easy for a guy to take advantage of ones inexperience and just be all "but you didn't ask me to go down on you, you never said you wanted to get off, I thought you were happy just giving me blowjobs whenever I ask for them which is all the time" 

Advocate for yo'self. (and use protection)

it is ok to set boundaries and say what you want. you don't have to live up to any standard but the one you set for yourself. 

also, sometimes your first time will hurt no matter how relaxed you are, there is such thing as an imperforate hymen and it's going to rip. this is not always true, (a lot of people have a first time that doesn't hurt) but it is sometimes true. on the plus side, it makes tampons much easier to deal with.

on using protection: put a drop of waterbased (think ky jelly) lube on his penis and then make sure there is no air in the condom by pinching the reservoir tip closed while he rolls it down the shaft.  take more lube (think handful) and slather it on the outside. if he tries to talk you out of the condom for any reason, 

**don't have sex with him.** don't even have oral sex with him, and I know that is a controversial opinion, but [antibiotic resistant Gonorrhea](http://www.cdc.gov/Std/Gonorrhea/arg/default.htm) is transmittable orally and sometimes asymptomatic, even if pregnancy is not. 

that said, for additional advice [this lady](http://www.thedirtynormal.com/) is a good resource. [this one](http://www.ohjoysextoy.com/) is more than just a sex toy review site, and the [Captain](http://captainawkward.com/) and the [Coquette](http://dearcoquette.com/) have never steered me wrong.
