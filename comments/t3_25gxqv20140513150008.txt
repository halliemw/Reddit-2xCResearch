I stayed a couple days alone in New York (137th), and had a great time. I also host people here in my spare room. I can get you the listing of the guy I stayed with if you like.

Look for hosts with at least a couple of reviews, and check out the host's profile. If you feel more comfortable staying with female, hosts, I'm sure you can find one. You can also see what profiles and identity documents the host has shared with airbnb. If it makes you feel more comfortable, chose one that has linked all their social media, and provided a copy of their passport.
