>I wish that we could reframe it to be more like drunken driving. It's a decision, it's a terrible decision with grievous consequences, it's a terrible decision that should have serious legal repercussions.

I think this would be a very effective way to look at it, and one I had not considered before. Farther down in this thread I had posited a few reasons for why sometimes I had trouble wrapping my head around the statistics regarding rape. 

This is an excellent line of reasoning that helped me move further in my understanding. 

Thank you for bringing it up.
