Hey.  My mom died of cancer.  She was a bit older (and so were us children), but we had a similar situation.  

>She has told me many times that a major coping mechanism for her is pretending that Iâ€™ll just go on living

Have you both addressed the practical side of your death - how she support the family, how you want to be buried, etc?  It seems like a lot of other people have given you good ideas about practical things to do for your daughter, so I thought I'd address the emotional part of it.

I have to say that your wife's response is pretty normal.  Especially when you get a heads up warning that someone close to you is going to die, it's pretty common to start distancing yourself and pulling away emotionally.  I know that's probably really emotionally isolating for you to deal with at the end of your life, and I'm sorry.

The *one thing* I think my family really wished we understood about my mom's death was that it could truly happen at any moment.  We were given a short time frame, but we thought she would sort of slowly weaken and drift away from us.  That's not what happened - one moment she was talking to us and the next moment she was dead.  If that kind of thing can happen to you, I would get your doctor to talk to your family about that, so they know what to expect.

It's really unfortunate that your wife won't seek counseling, though.  All of us saw a grief counselor, and it was *extremely* helpful.  That said, the walls your wife is putting up - they won't be up forever.  She will deal with things in her own time, even if it doesn't seem like it.

I think the one thing you could really do is just remind your wife that she doesn't have to handle this perfectly (and by the way, neither do you).  Everyone only dies once, and death isn't something we often handle.  So you'll make mistakes, or not know what to say, or be scared or numb - and that's perfectly normal.  

I'm sorry
