there are changing pads you can purchase. I had a portable changing pad. You keep it in your diaper bag. http://www.greenmomguide.com/sites/default/files/26.png

but take this and your diaper bag to the handicap stall and lay it on the floor and change your baby. Even if there is a changing station I laid this over the top of it. You dont know when the last time those things were cleaned.
