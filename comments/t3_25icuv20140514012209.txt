I completely get what you are saying, but let me be clear.  I am used to drinking, and I am normally pretty good at handling myself that way.  I didn't (or couldn't) defend myself because I was in utter shock.   This really nice person who we were just getting to know, was pulling these weirdo moves not ten feet behind my boyfriend.  If I was stone cold sober I still probably wouldn't know how to address it, because that is the kind of timid person I am.  Also it's never happened to me before.

EDIT: And yes, I did use the word slurring and staggering.  Maybe not to the extremes you are thinking of (aka, "white girl wasted") But I wasn't falling over.
