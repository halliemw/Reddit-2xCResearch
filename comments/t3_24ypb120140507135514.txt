Congratulations!!

We got married 5 yrs ago for 3k for 30 people.  Got my wedding dress at a thrift store(re purposed for the zombie crawl)   wedding bands at rollingring.com.   starting photographer ftom Craigslist for 150. 2 person band for 2 hours 150. And it was at a restaurant at lunch time so open bar and meals for every one were cheaper. And we did Sunday. 

It can be done!!
