It sounds it :-(. I'm not sure what you can do other than get another job. And maybe a calendar where you can "x" off the days.  Do they have Lyft where you are? Or maybe your husband could come rescue you for the weekend? In the end though, sounds like you'll just have to get through it. This too shall pass, and all that.
