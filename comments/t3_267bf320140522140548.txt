I think a lot of the problem comes from the fact that words are defined pragmatically. Feminists are people who call themselves feminists, regardless of what the dictionary says. Most of the time, that you support the idea that females deserve the basic rights of all humans goes without saying. Saying you're a feminist in a western country implies that you don't think our government reflects that belief, and people tend to view that as radical.

Most people who are moderate feminists on western countries don't need to identify themselves as feminists.
