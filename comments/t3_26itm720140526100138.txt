I hope this provides some comfort.  I've moved around a lot over the past few years, so within a small time frame I've had to see several different gynecologists to get check ups and pill refills.  Each one, every time I asked for the pill, would give me the same disclaimer: this may lighten, shorten, or completely stop your period. So I would say if my 4 doctors and yours have all said its normal - it's probably right.  I know it's scary to suddenly not have your body function like we think it should but it is normal. Just as best practice I would do some other form of birth control.  My boyfriend and I use the pill and the pull out method just for an added extra precaution.  I know the pull out method isn't the best but added with taking the pill we find it effective.
