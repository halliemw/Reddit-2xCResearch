That is awesome, and feels great, too. I was once on the subway and saw this guy yelling insults to two teenage girls who were both wearing a hijab. I got really angry so before stepping out from the subway car I called him out for being an adult and yelling at teenagers. (Didn't have the time to complain about the racism) I guess he sort of understood how much of an asshole that made him, because he shut up after that. Either way, I felt great. Don't know about the girls, though.
