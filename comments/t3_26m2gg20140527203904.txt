I hate my mother.  I broke off all ties with her in middle school when she left my father.  My father had Multiple Sclerosis and had recently become wheelchair bound.  She claimed that she loved him too much to be able to handle seeing him this way.  She ran off with another man and took everything she could, including half my Dad's 401k.

I refused to go with her and stayed behind with him instead.   I haven't spoken to her since and she has never seen her grandchildren.   She never will.  I've heard through my brothers her health is terrible and she is going to die miserable and alone.  Good.
