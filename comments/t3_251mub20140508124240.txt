I'm a non-Muslim American woman and I like to wear clothing that is suggestive of hijab in the fall. It's a comfortable and convenient clothing choice for the rainy northwest. I like avant garde fashion and not getting my hair wet. Also I think that they are beautiful and I would love to own real hijab but I worry about offending people who are Muslim and wear it for religious reasons.
