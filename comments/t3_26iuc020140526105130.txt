Raising a kid is tough. Raising a kid under the poverty line is really, really tough. Can it be done well? Sure! But I'm personally convinced that it takes a superhero to do it, and that there are a bunch of super hero single parents with 2 or 3 jobs and good relationships with their kids.

But anyone who has gone through that will tell you that without a certain amount of self sacrifice and luck it is impossible or at least seems that way. Child care costs a lot more than what some jobs pay. Without another wage earner you need to be in 3 places at once. 

Being able to take a year off is a privilege not everyone has. I work from home, and don't have kids of my own but my partner does, and I do a lot with the kids. They know I love them and would do anything for them. And if something happens at school or they're sick, I always feel super lucky that I have a job where I can just take a break and deal their needs and make up the time later.

Parents need more resources. We need to completely change how we treat work and employment in relationship to parenting. Mandatory paid maternity and paternity leave is amazing headway, but corporations need to figure out that having a child means producing another member of the work force and/or another customer, it's not like a personal hobby holiday. The job of raising kids is the job of the community, not just mothers, or parents.

So on the one hand, Emma's right, mothers who work long hard hours usually can't see their kids as much as rich people, or people with more flexible work, but that is not something we should blame mothers for, we need to figure out collectivity how to do better for children.
