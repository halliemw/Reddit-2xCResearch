This is what bothers me the most, like you said no one takes an interest in what you like, or rather they do not even care what I like. Which makes me feel like they do not care about me at all. For once it would be nice for someone to take an interest in my artwork, or ask me why I like reading certain books, or what is my opinion on a world event. Not one person I have dated in my entire life has done this. Is it really so much to ask from someone? To put forth just a little bit of thought and effort and show you really do care about me as a person? When do I get to meet someone who actually cares? Will I ever? I just don't even know anymore, my faith in this happening is just so low at this point. I do this for other people, I just wish it could be my turn for once.
