Many men, I think, are aware that women commonly find themselves valued for their appearance alone, and therefore adopt the sexual approach known as The Nice Guy. By this I mean keeping their initial looks-based sexual attraction a secret, feigning friendship, and hoping that a romantic attachment develops.

Even though this tactic is deceitful, and hence morally wrong, it must work at least some of the time, otherwise no one would do it.
