Thanks for the response it was really helpful! I have wide hips so my pooch isn't completely flat, and I can grab it a little generally. But when I retain water/bloat it's a lot bigger and, while you can still grab it a little, it's harder and uncomfortable. I'm doing exercises that target that area, but I feel I won't see the difference with the bloating there so often. I'm continuing regardless.

I probably won't cut things out just yet, but I'll start taking note of everything I'm eating. I'm going to try myself on probiotics and higher fibre cereal for a couple weeks, that way if that doesn't work then I know it's not a fibre or bacterial/digestive issue. If it isn't that, then I'll start by cutting dairy and see if that helps too. I eat yogurts quite a bit, usually have milk at least once with cereal and sometimes have cheese, butter, cream, etc. so it is what I will have some of on most days so it seems more likely if it turns out to be a food thing. Do you know if you cut out dairy, when it is best time to start introducing bits of dairy again to see if that specific thing is the problem, or if whether it's just all dairy?
