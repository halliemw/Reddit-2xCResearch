I'm sure we could have said all that without resorting to calling male engineers names or rather crude generalizations about them, simply because of how you picture engineers.

A few other possibilities?

4.  Nobody really likes an intern.  They take a long time to bring up to speed, there is no guarantee they'll be around long enough to finish a job once they are up to speed, and the work they do has to be checked by a responsible person as the level of their work hasn't been verified through experience. A lot of engineers are busy as shit, and simply inviting that conversation with a new person can turn into a major drain on productive work.

5.  They're a bit afraid of you. With all of the supposed*stories* of *spiteful*  women claiming harassment at the slightest offense, they may be scared that if they glance at you the wrong way, it's off to HR and a pink slip for them.  It isn't just that they miss the boys club (they probably do), it is that they don't know where the line for professionalism is with a new individual, who happens to be a chick.
