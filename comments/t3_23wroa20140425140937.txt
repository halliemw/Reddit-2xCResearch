Yeah, I agree with you. It sounds like this is actually her mom going pre-emptively Mama Bear. She's calling the family basically saying, "I think she's gay -- and I want her RESPECTED and ACCEPTED, dammit!"  A lot of parents say the thing that was so hard for them about their child coming out was the fear about how they would be treated.
I get that. My dad sat me down when I was 16 and he assumed I was dating my best friend -- I'm a white girl, BFF is a black man. Dad wanted me to know he absolutely, positively had no problem with it -- but he wanted to be sure I understood that other people might, and wanted me to be prepared to deal with it. That wasn't guilt of any kind on his part -- it was life experience that showed him I might get hurt. He was trying to be proactive. I think OP's mom may have been acting from that same fear and desire to protect her kid.

Doesn't make it less frustrating for this 21 year old, but it will get better, OP. I hope it turns out to be a story you and your family can laugh about eventually. You have a very loving family -- that is acting kind of bone-headed right now.
