That's exactly what the court and justice system attempt to do though. If we didn't quantify somehow to try to determine the varying degrees of awful that crime can reach then we end up punishing all crimes identically, which would be ridiculous. In the same way that armed robbery is considered more significant than unarmed, violent rape is considered more significant, otherwise you're handing out identical sentences for vastly different crimes. This is not to diminish how awful a non-violent rape can be, but we certainly do need to distinguish and quantify the levels of crimes.
