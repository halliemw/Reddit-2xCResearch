"upsetting people is rude". so where are the lines drawn? how far should we go not to upset each other? should we not mention it when we know someone is abusive to their spouse? perhaps we don't want to hurt their feelings for beating up their wife? i mean they might be self consensus about it. or maybe the line is only when it isn't harming others. should we not speak up about someone's addiction to heroine? i mean wouldn't want to hurt their feelings and get them to go use more heroine to make things right. maybe we shouldn't voice our concerns over a friend who seems to be abusing their addictive pain pills? maybe we shouldn't be vocal about that guy taking pictures of kids at the park from the bushes? how far should we have to censor our concerns for other people so that we don't appear rude? 

it may suck that somebody has commented on someone else getting fat. but it may also suck for them that they see their friends becoming unhealthy. maybe more people should be vocal about their concerns. maybe too many people are trying to be polite, while their friends waste away from obesity or drug addiction. 

i think people have an obligation to speak out against these things. otherwise you are just enabling it.
