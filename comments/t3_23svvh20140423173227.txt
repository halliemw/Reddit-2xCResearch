I would be pissed if I ever got a message like that but I also don't look for casual sex on the internet or otherwise. I've never gotten raunchy messages when I use internet dating either, so I've been lucky.

I think men assume that if a woman is looking for casual sex then the woman's mindset is like their own, pure sex, no flowery bits, just get down to business. I'm not excusing it, just thinking that's probably what's up. I would also just assume that if someone was that up front about what they want and how they're going to behave, it's rather helpful. You can either steer clear or go with it. It's ten times better than the men who pretend to be good guys to get in a woman's pants and end up being not a very good person.
