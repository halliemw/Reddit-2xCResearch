Also, this may be something he came to discover about himself unknowingly, and not something he initially set out to intentionally find.

I never heard of the term broken wing before this post, but I can see how such an attraction could develop. I once went through a period where 3 girls I dated in a row (one quite seriously, nearly a 2 year relationship) all were recovering anorexics. This wasn't known to me until after we started dating for any of the three (2 were on the thinner side, but the third I never would have guessed it looking at her, so I woudln't say it was a physical attraction to a specific body type).

After the third one told me about it, I began to question whether there is something specific personality-wise about people who have been in that situation that makes me attracted to them. Certainly their experience has shaped them as a person, so one cannot say that it isn't always something they carry. I never really figured out an answer for myself on that one, but the pattern seemed to have broke itself, so I stopped looking for one. Perhaps it's just the case that your SO was in a similar situation, and in looking for his own answers stumbled upon this 'broken wing' fetish and it seemed to provide some sort of explanation (though I'd be skeptical even if this turns out to be his reasoning.)
