I was homeschooled all but my last year of highschool, and this frustrates the hell out of me. 

I had all the modest rules: couldn't wear a short skirt. Couldn't wear a deep V neck. Couldn't wear a tight shirt with baggy pants or vice versa. I wasn't even allowed to watch Disney channel because apparently everyone was oversexualized. Dance numbers with kids my age on TV? Oversexualized.

I never even made the connection my parents wanted me to make. Instead of hearing "sex is bad" or even "be careful when you have sex" I just thought they were weird for not letting me watch kid shows.

The bottom line is none of the things they thought would expose me to sex did. I never thought about sex when I watched Vanessa and Zac dance. I never thought about sex when Zac and Cody were ruining the hotel they lived in. I thought about love, meaningful friendships, and having fun. 

The bottom line is that when stuff like this happens it is the parents that are sexualizing them. Let the poor girl have her prom. She's not looking for a guy to bang, she's looking for a meaningful night and fun. 

Sorry for formatting and two bottom lines. I'm tired and on mobile.
