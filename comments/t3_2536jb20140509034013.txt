My experience wasn't great either, for what its worth. I had just two days of that energized feeling and then literally felt normal again, slightly sluggish again for the rest of my use of wellbutrin, about 9 weeks. On top of not suppressing my appetite or giving me energy, I had headaches and moods swings the first 4-6 weeks, and after that I spent most of a week just crying and feeling terrible. Just got off the wellbutrin and I don't necessarily feel better but not nearly so far down - slept a ton for at least a week coming off of it!
