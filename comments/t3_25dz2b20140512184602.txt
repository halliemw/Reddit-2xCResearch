This one has some backstory, so bear with:

I live in a fairly rough neighborhood, and one day came home to find a girl hooking on my front porch. Literally sitting and acting like it was her place. She wanders off, but early the next morning (around 5 am) I was taking my boyfriend to work, a guy races up and parks behind my car blocking us in and asks if the hooker was around. My boyfriend, obviously weirded out, said no and then the guy saw me in the car and asked "Well, is she available?" My boyfriend just didn't answer and got in the car and said "Lock the doors." I had no idea what was happening because I was in the car and also half-asleep.

Not really a come-on but a seriously creepy event none the less. Also not the last time randos came to my house thinking they could pay for sex.
Tl;dr Got mistaken for a hooker
