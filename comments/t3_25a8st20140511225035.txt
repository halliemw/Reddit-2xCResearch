Thank you!

I'm not familiar with uterine fibroids. I'll be looking into that. I have asked both my mom and dad about family history. I've gotten no conclusive information from either having to do with this, but I likely won't give up-unless I never experience these issues again (fat chance!). 

I've been keeping tabs on the bad months-maybe i should be more dedicated to the cause.
