I think grew up in one of the more conservative bubbles of culture, to be honest, at least with respect to sexuality. Now that I'm older, I know quite a few Christians who don't think that waiting until marriage is a necessity. At this point, it's a choice I've made for myself and my situation. I don't mind if other Christians think the way you describe, nor do I think they're less of Christians. I have more respect for Christians who acknowledge that marrying later (25-30) means that sex is probably going to happen before that, than I do for Christians who say that you should both marry late AND wait to have sex.
