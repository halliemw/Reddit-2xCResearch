They make a non-hormonal copper IUD though I hear cramping usually gets worse with that, not easier like with Mirena. 

YAZ is estrogen while Mirena is progesterone. The progesterone tends to be a lot more agreeable with people and have less side effects as the estrogen. I highly recommend trying it out as it's very different than YAZ.
