Thanks for your comments, they're really helpful! 

I'm sorry you weren't completely happy with the results. This is my main concern as well. You said in another comment that I should look at before and after photos and I have done just that! I save pictures of noses that are similar to mine and pictures of after results that are either what I'm going for or that are too much for me. I'm trying to be very realistic. I also found a picture of a nose that is just like mine and that my surgeon did and I really love how it turned out. Of course I'm still going to ask for more photos and make it clear that I don't want a big change. 

I do have a little baby fat in my face but I seriously fear that years are only going to make my situation worse. My nose has already grown a lot and my face is most likely going to slim down too. I do not have a cute nose and I'm certain it's not just in my head. I actually think that larger ethnic noses look gorgeous but I'm Scandinavian and we usually have those cute noses but mine is really off and it ages me horribly. My friends haven't said anything either because well, this is the way I look and they love me for who I am. Just like I don't see flaws in my friends.

Oh and one reason why I want to do this is because I'm moving to another city later this year. I'm worried about people judging me so the timing would be kind of great.
