I'm so so sorry this has happened to you. I do have to suggest that it's better you're seeing this for the red flag it is now. I had a partner who originally was super attentive and then we married and were long distance. Our communication went from nightly to a couple times a week to every other week, and from hours at a time to minutes. When I moved in I was in a dependent position which was terrible in its self, but then he denied me thing that I needed when I asked for then (like groceries). The straw that broke my back though was that he basically didn't talk to me for days on end despite the fact we lived together and shared a bed.

Some people don't have the understanding of how to be in relationships. The best lesson they can get is having someone leave them.
