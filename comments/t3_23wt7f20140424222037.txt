You will need to swallow pills for one or more of the following:

* anti-diarrhea (pharmaceutical cervical dilators can cause diarrhea in some patients).
* painkillers (because you'll probably be in pain afterwards).
* antibiotics (to prevent infection post-surgery).

I do not know if the clinic would refuse to continue if you are unable to take pills as provided.  It's better to bring a piece of bread and seem odd than not be able to take the pills when needed.
