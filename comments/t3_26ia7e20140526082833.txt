I didn't always when I was much smaller, but having moved up a few cup sizes, I always wear a bra.  It's just more comfortable for me.

The only times I felt comfortable skipping before were in certain summer tops or when I was wearing a cami under a hoodie.  I would never have forgone a bra in a setting that wasn't very informal. (No judgment - just what I was comfortable with.)
