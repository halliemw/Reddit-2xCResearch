Just lay down the law at your next opportunity, especially if your interactions make you feel uncomfortable. Do it in a way where you aren't like HAY I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP WITH YOU, SO FUCK OFF, and are more like, "Hey, I respect you as a friend and colleague; I just wanted to be clear that I am in a serious relationship. I hope I haven't misconstrued our interactions, but sometimes I feel like we're flirting, and I wanted to make it clear that I am not romantically interested in you." HOPEFULLY, if he's actually flirting, he'll respect your honesty and assertiveness.

Reword that as you choose.
