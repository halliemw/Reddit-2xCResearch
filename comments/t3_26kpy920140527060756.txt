Goddamn, as a manager i am bewildered. Wtf is your manager doing if they arent sorting out staffing? Apart from paperwork that is pretty much the entire job description! If you went into the job with the expectation that the shifts would be cycled bring it up with your manager. There (should) be a clause in your contract about shifts reflecting the needs of the business, so if your co-worker is constantly refusing to work a shift they need to review their employment. If the manager gives you the brush-off, then talk to someone in head office because they aren't doing their job! And if they are half-assing it on something as basic as rosters they'll be half-assing it elsewhere.
