Agreed.   I'm a surrogate (6 months pregnant).  It is a choice you give up in choosing to be a surrogate -  you are having someone else's child,  you have to give them the decision on what is in the child's best interest.   After all,  after the baby is born,  it's not like you get to go critique their parenting.
