you'll probably get a lot of comments in here with people telling you to yell something mean back at the guy(s) that harassed you. personally, i disagree with that response. it's not the safe thing to do, nor is it (in my opinion) effective. guys like that are looking for a response-- any response. it doesn't matter if you say "thanks!" or "fuck you!" you're still giving them exactly what they want. they're trying to get a rise out of you. if it's positive (which they know 99.9999% of the time it won't be), then great. if not, they still want you to interact with them.

with that being said, i just ignore it and completely forget about it. maybe it's my competitive streak, but this is how i look at it: those guys weren't thinking about me 5 seconds ago and 5 seconds later they will have completely forgotten i exist. why the fuck should i spend my entire day dwelling on them? then they "win." i realize it's a bit silly to look at it that way and generally i don't advocate spending one's life tallying imaginary social "wins" and "losses," but in this situation, i honestly think that the best way to "get back" at guys like that is to just forget they exist and go on with my life.

i know it's annoying that we have to deal with that stuff sometimes, but don't think of it as something that you'll have to "cope" with like it's a disease or something. we live in a messy, not-always-nice world. and yeah, sometimes it kinda sucks. but if a stupid guy yelling out his car at you the worst thing that happens to you all day, count your blessings.
