Most women go to the few remaining clinics in the state--they're clustered in Austin, Houston, Dallas, and maybe San Antonio. A huge barrier to women in Texas right now is how difficult/expensive it can be to make it to one of the big city clinics if they're from a southern or rural area. Maybe you could look into coordinating a ride network?
