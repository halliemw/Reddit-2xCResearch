I experienced something like this too, although from the other side. I'm a mid-twenties male and I accompanied my mother when she went to the dealer to actually begin the process of buying a new car. When it came to the person in the chain whom you talk to in order to organize payment/s, he kept directing questions to *me*, even though the car was for my mother and she was the one paying for it. Twice when he asked me a question, I just turned and looked at my mother expectantly for her to answer, hoping he'd get the hint.

Oddly enough, he didn't. Come the third time, I had to *directly tell him* "You ought to ask her, she's the one making all the decisions here".
