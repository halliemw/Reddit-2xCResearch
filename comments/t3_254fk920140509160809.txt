The main point of Goldie-Blox being gendered was that (A) it entered a story into a market that didn't have stories (construction toys) and (B) so that someone looking for toys in the 'pink aisle' would be able to find a construction toy.

That being said, while I agree the initial idea is cool (to have a specifically girly construction toy that also appeals to the storytelling aspect many girls like) the actual execution of the toy is pretty crap when compared to other construction toys.
