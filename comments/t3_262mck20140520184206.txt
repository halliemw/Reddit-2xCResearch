The good news is, most people are extroverts and love to talk.  If you come prepared to ask a few questions, it's pretty easy to get people started and then just nod and um-hum at appropriate intervals and if you can, comment or ask more questions about what they've just said.  Most people will happily keep talking on and think you're a wonderful conversationalist.

Is this a plated reception or a buffet?  A sit down dinner will be easier since you're seated with a table who will largely talk amongst themselves and all you have to do is sit and smile and maybe comment on how beautiful the ceremony was, or the food, or maybe some random current event topic.  Don't talk politics, but maybe scan the news for interesting headlines in case anyone else brings it up.  If it's a buffet or if there's a wine and cheese thing before dinner, grab a drink, check out the spread, remark on how lovely it is, find someone you know and just stand next to them and hold your drink or a little platter of cheese and fruit.  Smile and nod.

It's okay to duck out a little early.  Give some time, as much as you can stand, after the cake thing, and then make your goodbyes to the bride and groom.  They won't care that one person is leaving early.  They're super busy and overwhelmed and will just be happy you came and didn't cause any kind of awkward scene since you're probably a pretty quiet person.  You can do this!
