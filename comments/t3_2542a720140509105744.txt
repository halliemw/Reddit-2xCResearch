Soooo I am a total and utter creep, but I really enjoyed my friend's abortion. I felt like a secret agent, made all the appointments, even had to do some illegal stuff, and got to hold my friend's hand and hang out for 2 days. She was pretty much emotionally unaffected by it so it was like a macabre feminist adventure filled with ice cream, time off work, movies, etc. The clinic itself was really interesting, amazing women, truly inspirational. All in all the whole thing was much easier than she expected I think and I was blown away with the support and atmosphere.

Abortion has been legal and highly inexpensive where I live for many many years so there were no protestors, and no one at the clinic looked like they were distraught, mostly a mix of irritated, anxious, and so on. Lots of men with women partners it looked like, and I didn't see anyone there alone.

My friend told me the ceiling in the procedure room was covered in puzzles, optical illusions, visual material that was distracting and interesting. I think that was my favourite part.

The would be father was really young, in high school, and sort of couldn't handle the whole thing. He was really grateful that I offered to take on all the logistics and bought me a bunch of weed as a gift.

10/10 would attend more abortions
