When I'm pretty sure that I'm alone in the kitchen, cooking or cleaning or whatever, I will totally rock out to whatever is on my iPod. Lip syncing, sometimes actual singing, definitely dancing (sometimes even dancing that includes serenading the dishes or sliding around the kitchen floor in my socks). He has apparently seen me do this more than once. I love him because he always waits until I find a natural pause point before coming in the kitchen. The only reason I know that he knows I do this is because he told me he thought I was cute.
