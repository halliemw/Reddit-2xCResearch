I do think about that too. I was scared to be alone and frankly I just fell hard for him. He made me feel important and I had never felt loved before. He was my best friend, my first boyfriend. We lived together and talked about our future. When he hurt me he would apologize, sweet-talk me, cry, comfort me, buy me stuff, tell me he was going to change so much etc. 

When things got worse I was still clinging on to the little bit of hope it  would get better. I was more in love with the memories and feelings of infatuation I had with this person more than him himself. He was the first person I fell in love with. 

By the times things got so bad I didn't want to leave because I couldn't imagine being so alone. I cut ties with a lot of friends because I thought he was all I needed. I depended on him to help pay rent and bills. When they say "love is a hell of a drug" they arent lieing. I was completely addicted to the feeling of being in a relationship (no matter how miserable I was) Despite everything I was scared of the thought of having no one to talk to. Coming home to nobody. Sleeping by myself. It was overwhelming to consider at the time because of how weak I was. 

The thought of going from being someones everything everyday to being alone terrified me. By that point I was too emotionally invested in the relationship. I felt him growing away and becoming distant so I tried pulling him closer, only to have him pull away harder and so on. In a way, at the end it wasn't even a relationship. We were on opposite teams. He was putting down to build himself up. It was almost a parasitic  relationship, & extremely emotionally exhausting to say the least.

But I digress, Ive had time take a long hard look at myself and why I did everything I thought I wouldn't. Anyways I will look into that book you suggested. Thank you so much.
