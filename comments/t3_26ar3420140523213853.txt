I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for your honest opinions. We did talk more about it, and we agreed that we would compromise just as /u/indiscriminatedrive! said. I'm going to wait until my contract is up, and I'm settled in a secure job. Who knows? Maybe by then I'll have changed my mind. Thanks again, TwoX!
