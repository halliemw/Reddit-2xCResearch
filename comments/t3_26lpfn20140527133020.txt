My question in all of this is why are you in school? Is it just a passing hobby, or are you getting educated in hopes of finding a career you will enjoy that will allow you to earn more money in the future? If it is the latter, school is your job right now. Increasing your long term earning power is much more important to your future than making sure you and your boyfriend split bills equally.
