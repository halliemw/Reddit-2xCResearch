Yeah that's probably part of it, I will admit I've still got niggling voices of the 'people will make fun of you' type even if that sort of stuff happened quite a long time ago now. But it sticks with you.

 And also the being rather self conscious that I might do dumb things when talking to people and not always realise I'm doing them and of course the 'How do I explain to people about dyspraxia/when do I bring it up because it'll probably affect things in a relationship' (despite the fact it's been identified as long as dyslexia it's not as well known)
