I don't encounter it very often, but my father-in-law and his dad are the *worst.* I started taking notice of it more and more - I will be looking right at them, in mid-sentence, and they will break eye contact and start talking to my husband as if I wasn't saying a thing. It's baffling! I've never seen anyone else be so blatant about it. 

When I worked at a car dealership, I usually had to repeat myself a couple times in a large discussion before the men acknowledged me. It was super annoying. I knew they could hear me - I've always been loud, haha - I was just put on the back burner.
