There's one thing that always struck me about those ads. It looks like they put effort into having diversity of age, race, and body type, making them collectively an average woman. But all of them are feminine, well dressed and made up, and obviously put a fair amount of thought and effort into being beautiful.

In the eyes of Dove, if you don't fit into those categories you might as well not exist. How's that for an uplifting message?
