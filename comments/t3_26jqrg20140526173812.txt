Try to put some effort in maintaining close friends, they will be helpful in the future, especially if you pick your friends wisely, you don't want to be friend's with the douche, or the annoying dude, you want to be friends with people that can have a serious conversation and at the same time play some PS4 or LAN for a bit, also sport is important. JUST BALANCE EVERYTHING, i didn't my internet addiction and social anxiety prevented me from making friendships and i wasn't men enough to even try to fight it, i would just go home from school and didn't talk much with my colleagues, also i wasn't bullied that much, my school was pretty nice, they just kind of, didn't interest me, at all, those crude talks about stupid retarded shit..
