Volunteer!

My favorite is the local humane society often needs someone to help socialize the puppies and kittens (and adult dogs & cats). Yes, you also have to clean litter boxes and puppy poo, but you get to play with/walk the critters and feel good for it!

Another suggestion would be checking with your local library for volunteer positions. Shelve books, man the info desk, or do story-time.

These are just two low-stress options that can fit into a busy schedule and still make you feel like a productive member of society. Feel free to find a cause you're passionate about and throw as much or as little of yourself as needed into it.

That said, you've got jack to prove to anyone. Sounds like you're manning all the housework, going to school, and working on the side. Your family needs to stuff it. Worry about you and your SO's happiness first and foremost.
