By playing by the rules, i'm not saying we should judge others based on appearance. But rather since we know how others will judge us, we should strive not be perceived negatively based on our appearance. None of that is immoral.

Maybe it's convenient for you to resort to ad hominem, but I don't think it adds any logical merit to your argument.
