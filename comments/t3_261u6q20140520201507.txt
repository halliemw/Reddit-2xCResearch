Stuff like that happens all the time and it's sick. My closest friend was molested repeatedly since like 3 to 8 and at 16 she finally told her mom..after going to court the fucker only has to stay away from her and has a few months probation>Everywhere, it seems like recently. Remember the guy who raped a 14-year-old girl who killed herself by trial and got five months of community service?
