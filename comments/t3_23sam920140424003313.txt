On the one hand, to quote a disturbing Cher song "it's a woman's world" We've gone way beyond equality and in a few generations men will serve women. 

On the other hand it is my strong opinion that in cases such as this, both parties split the bill. You both ate the food, you both enjoyed the food. Go Dutch, I believe is the saying. If you don't do so, you're footing the bill and that's a mighty large bill. 

Also, I could be enjoying the wine a little too much, but did your post mention your telling your SO about the pregnancy? If so, what was his reaction to it, how did he feel? Did he run screaming for the hills?

You would be surprised how many men, especially the good ones, demand to be able to pay for the bill. Don't let them, not as a controlling method but if you want to say you are equal to him, you should pay for half or whatever portion you can muster up as compared to their income.
