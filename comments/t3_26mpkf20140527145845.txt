I don't think they look like they've been hacked up. The scarring can be interpreted as natural/normal body to body variation. I wouldn't have jumped to the conclusion that you must have had plastic surgery based on these photos.

To my knowledge, there's no non-invasive way to correct nipple shapes. But honestly, I think your nipples look very ordinary, and they seem like a nice size for your breasts.

I used to not like my nipples (they look more like [this](http://www.007b.info/b/breasts/o/20-yr.jpg)), but after living with them for a while and seeing that many other women have nipples like that made me feel more comfortable with them.
