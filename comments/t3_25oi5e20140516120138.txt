Thank you for believing in me! :) It actually does mean a lot to hear that, even from an internet stranger. 

Yes, my counselor said that it's good that I'm aware of these things, but I still feel like I need tools to do the opposite of all the things I've learned. Still sort of lost as to what the opposite really looks like. 

I'm going to talk about it to my SO tomorrow, hopefully! It's hard to bring up serious things like this with him sometimes, or anyone really, for me. I just get so embarrassed about it, but I need to get over that. Thank you!
