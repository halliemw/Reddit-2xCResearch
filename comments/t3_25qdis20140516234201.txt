As obscure as this comment is going to sound - What about when the whole office "synchronizes"? 

If this were to go ahead it would be really difficult to manage half of your staff taking sick days due to their "Cycle".

I agree on the sick day statement in that if you are sick you are sick be it physically, mentally or other. You do not need to advertise why you are not able to work just that you can not. 

If "Menstrual leave" was a thing here i can guarantee the whole office would be taking the same couple of days off.
