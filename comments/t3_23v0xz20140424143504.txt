If he's 50+ and understands social niceties, he should definitely know that is not an appropriate way to meet people.   I would find it creepy and be uncomfortable and I'm not in my 20s.  If I was being polite, I'd extricate myself from the conversation with something like, "Gotta go to an appointment now. Bye" and KEEP WALKING.  If he made me really uncomfortable, I'd pretend to have forgotten something and go back to a more populated area.
