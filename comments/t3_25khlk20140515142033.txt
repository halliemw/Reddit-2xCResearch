I have tried to explain the large dog thing to men and they just come right back with how stupid it is (although, frankly, my daughter's dog is more than a match for any of them - but many men really hate thinking about it).  

This is a reason why some women literally get larger, as well.  Sexual abuse victims often bulk up, weight-wise, often without any conscious desire to do so, because it is indeed harder to tackle/carry off a bigger woman.

Big dogs, medium-sized protective dogs, pepper spray, martial arts...all things that women use to keep the creeps away.  And once you've been assaulted, it's hard not to want to think of a way to prevent it or to, even unconsciously, do something to prevent it.  

It's not just unwanted attention.  Women are more vulnerable to property crimes in parks, etc., as well.
