Not that I'm all that much older than you, but I know many people who have gotten engaged or married very young (some married even before turning 21) and all of them ended terribly. 

Yours is the most mature and thoughtful answer I've heard from anyone planning to marry young and I sincerely wish you guys the best.

Love,
