I would love to be able to do this someday! Right now I don't have the time as a DVM student, but I do have a wonderful grandmother who can occasionally hem things or shorten the straps on tops which tends to make a huge difference in how they fit. If you've found any particularly good resources for learning alterations or have sewing machine recommendations, let me know! I'd love to start learning some of this!
