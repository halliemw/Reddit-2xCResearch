Only double majoring if I do industrial too. I said electrical/mechanical engineering because that's what it's called in my uni (or in my country, I guess), "electromechanical engineering" :)

I've been told it's pretty hard. I also have a young daughter so I won't be able to study all the time like some other students. I hope I can do it!
