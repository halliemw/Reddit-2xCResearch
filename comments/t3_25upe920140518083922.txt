A lot more than I realized until this thread got me thinking :)

Makeup (oh god, the makeup!), doing my hair, crafts, cleaning (it's so relaxing to put on some headphones, block out the sounds of the kids fighting/playing, and just CLEAN), cooking and baking, and flower gardening. 

I do like a lot of traditionally male activities too, like building furniture and watching tv with my hand down my pants.
