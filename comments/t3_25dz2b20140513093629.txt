Does anyone else have a facial piercing? I have a nose ring, and maybe I'm just being overly sensitive, but men of a certain age tend to get this really creepy smile when they ask me if it hurt when I got the ring. Women generally wince if they ask the question, but the men who ask always leer... Blugh.
