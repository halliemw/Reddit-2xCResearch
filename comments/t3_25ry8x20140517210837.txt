Sounds like the masculine-feminine polarity is waning.   This is what creates the initial attraction.  Over time, the balance can be lost.  There are resources available online that explain this theory better than I could in a comment.  Try a search with the keywords: masculine feminine polarity balance relationship sex.  This should send you on the right path.  The fact that you are aware of your current situation, and seeking resolution, says a lot about the strength of your relationship.  I recommend sharing your findings with your boyfriend and let him read it for himself.  I think this will revive his masculinity, and subsequently the feminine within you.  Best of luck!
