I went to several of these as a child in Colorado and Texas. Though I was only like 9, 10 and 11 I felt incredibly uncomfortable. I honestly didn't understand what it was for and didn't really get what was going on and I'm sure thats what half of those little girls were thinking too. I remember thinking it was weird that I was dancing with my dad or that he was my "date". I loved my father but it just didn't seem natural. Though I was young I've always been very aware of my surroundings and how it made me feel and It all felt very contrived. I remember there being talk of husbands and I just didn't really care... I probably would have rather gone to Applebees.

Thought I didn't care at the time, those memories have always stuck with me and have never left. Hearing my father say "If you have sex before marriage I will have failed as a father" has put a mark on me I'm afraid I can never erase. Putting so much emphasis on my "purity" over how kind, compassionate and strong I am has left me as an adult with a constant battle between what makes me valuable in a relationship and what I'm worth. I may not be a virgin but goddamn it am I pure of heart. I have the biggest heart and love all who come in and out of my life and those are the kinds of things that should matter in a daughter. The way he taught me to stand up for myself and others in times of distress or the way he taught me to take care of those who were weaker than me are the qualities that really matter in a daughter.
