Totally crazy that a woman could do that, what with having a uterus and such.  

I think about 40% of my med school class was female, and that was in the 80's.

I do live in a backward, redneck area right now.  Moving soon to a hopefully somewhat less backward, redneck area.  At least it's more metropolitan.
