>He then started shooting in front of an Alpha Phi sorority house located near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara; there, two members of the sorority Delta Delta Delta were killed and a third wounded while walking on the sidewalk. Prior to this, Rodger approached the Alpha Phi house doorway and knocked on it for a few minutes, but focused on the Delta Delta Delta members instead after no one answered.[14][15][16][8] After shooting the sorority members, Rodger fired at a nearby couple; the man was wounded, while the woman suffered a superficial graze wound.[

I strongly, strongly disagree with your idea that he wasn't 'so driven' by his need to kill women. Let's look at his pattern, here: he targed people close to him (his roommates), then went to his next target: women. When that failed he went on an outright spree. His main targets should be determined to be personally connected to him, and women. 

I'll be honest here, your comment really disturbs me because you seem to be taking lack of body count to mean that misogyny wasn't a driving force. Meanwhile you then go on to say 'he hated the males getting laid' but ignore the obvious problem, here - he hated them for getting something that he felt *entitled* to. It is all strongly shaped and guided by his view of women as sexual objects to be attained for his own gratification. 

As I said before, his mental health is a big part of this, but the misogyny embedded in his hatred towards women and the men who had attained what he hadn't - physical access to women - should not be ignored.
