Are in the US?  If so, you can check for the statute of limitations  of your state [here](http://angelroar.com/foradults/c-child-abuse-resources-adults/childabusestatuteoflimitationsbystate), if you want to pursue any legal action.  I don't know if anything can be done at this point, but you can always consult an attorney for legal advice. I would suggest you to seek some form of counseling, as well. I'm sorry this happened to you.
