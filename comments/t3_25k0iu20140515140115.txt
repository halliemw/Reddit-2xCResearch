Kudos on getting tested. I've had two checks in my lifetime, despite not having many partners. Both just urine tests. One was at Uni, which a society I'd joined was encouraging we did as a group (not like peeing together in the same room or anything, just encouraging members!) And the other was a routine check at my doctors when I went to get my contraceptive injection. Both clear and un-invasive, though peeing in a pot can be tricky! 
I'm amazed at how judgemental your nurse was. I've never had anyone give me that weird six-degrees-of-separation bullshit nor suggest I stop having sex (I live in the UK, I think if someone tried to push abstinence, there would be riots!) Consider putting a complaint in. You shouldn't feel shamed in any way for getting your health checked, this kind of practice could easily put others off getting checked again.
