Update: I discussed this with her and she said that she realized she was an idiot. She used sexual tension as an excuse. She told me, "Well neither of us can drive and we are never alone, so I took the opportunity and ran with it." 

She sighed and asked why I HAD to tell my parents. My problem with this is that my parents feel that she is a bad influence and my dad said that maybe I shouldn't be able to have friends over anymore unless my parents are constantly supervising us. I don't do anything bad, but I don't really want my parents constantly with me and I know that my parents don't always want to watch me like a three year old.
