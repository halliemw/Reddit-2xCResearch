Strange about the coconut oil. . .definitely never heard that before, as the only thing I've heard about it is that it's anti-yeast (which is never a bad thing!)  I will look into it.

About the skin thinning. . .it is a definite concern, and it's really important to not have a more is more philosophy when applying it.  I was told this information about not tapering the dosage until symptoms subside by a person who saw a specialist who is pretty prominent in the field of pelvic pain.  Here is his website, and the approach is loosely mentioned there as well: [Andrew Goldstein/CVVD](http://www.cvvd.org/lichen_sclerosus).  

Of course, you should do what makes you comfortable, and I can definitely understand why the possibility of thin skinning freaks people out!  Maybe listening to your body and seeing how it responds is the best idea.
