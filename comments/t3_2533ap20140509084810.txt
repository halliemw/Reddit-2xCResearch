I didn't cry, but I did have a private freak-out while I was in the chair.  I went from elbow-length hair to a pixie.  I was definitely ready for a change and my hairdresser was totally gung-ho about chopping it all off.  I just had this one moment of panic, like "Oh my god, I did it, there's no going back now!"  That was over a year ago and I still love it.
