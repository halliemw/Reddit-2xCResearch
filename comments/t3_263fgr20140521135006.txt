The best I've ever heard it described is with the pigeon experiment.  2 pigeons are placed in separate boxes with levers they can peck with their beaks.  Pigeon A will receive food every time it pecks the lever, if the food stops coming eventually they will stop trying.  Pigeon B gets food every time and then it changes to randomly.  When the food stops, they will continue to peck at it until they pass out.  Why?  Because maybe the next try will give it food.  

As has been said earlier, abusive relationships start out great and slowly eat away at the victim's self-esteem over time.  Also, they aren't bad all the time and the bad times are blamed on the victim.  Positive and negative reinforcement is given randomly.  It keeps the person off balance.  "If only I didn't do ____, things would be good."  "If only I did ___, things would be good."  Except navigating the chaos and predicting reactions is actually impossible.  So effort and emotional energy is spent navigating the minefield, that there isn't anything else left to step back and look at it objectively.  

People also don't want to believe that they are in love with an abuser.  It's a very difficult thing to wrap your head around.  It takes a lot just to admit it.    

Most abusers aren't aware of it as they have completely justified their behaviour in their minds.  A lot of it comes down to having unhealthy viewpoints of women and relationships.
