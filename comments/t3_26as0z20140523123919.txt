What not living together yet? Now i'm lost, if you live separately each persons home is their responsibility there would be no shared chores? If he is over at your place and helps its a kind gesture not responsibility, and same goes the other way around with you at his. Unless its a together every night so might as well be living their thing?  How can he be expected to fill the pantry at a place he does not live? Why would he 'need' to do that?
