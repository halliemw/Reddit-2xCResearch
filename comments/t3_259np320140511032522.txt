No people would not say "Well, you're his girlfriend..." At least not decent ones. I'm sorry you had to go through this. He sounds like a shit. 

Humans love to put things into categories but the real world isn't as nice as the boxes we like to create. I think the issue for you is not to figure out if this IS or ISN'T rape, but to figure out how you want to respond to what happened to you. 

You could talk to other victims and learn more and no one in the world is going to tell you you're *not allowed* because your experiences were not legitimate. Or you could decide that he is an asshole ex-boyfriend and no one in the world is going to tell you you're *not allowed* to forget about him like the asshole ex-boyfriend he is because he did some extremely problematic things to you. 

You do you. Process this however you need to. You don't need to focus on the definition (though if it helps you cope, you can too!). Just figure out what you can do for yourself to make yourself feel better. 

You are a beautiful soul deserving of somebody who treats you with respect as the entire human being you are.
