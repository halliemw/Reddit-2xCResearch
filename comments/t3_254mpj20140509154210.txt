Have you considered a poop transplant? It could up the good bacteria in your gut. I have been hearing great things about poofusions. It could stop future C. difficile issues.

Don't worry about all the blood and being embarrassed it's a natural process and the medical staff should be able to handle that. I would complain about the lack of closing a door or curtain though! They obviously need more training in bedside manners.
