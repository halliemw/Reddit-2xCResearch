I raised my infant daughter in Midtown Atlanta, a place not foreign to gay dads. (I am straight; my wife had to go right back to her high-pressure, high-pay corporate job) I have got up in the grill of many a cafe or restaurant manager in that area and very politely pointed out to them the problematic of only having changing tables in the ladies'. To their everlasting credit, just about every single one of them was like "Oh, goodness: you're right. It just never occurred."

Now you see a lot more active dads and this is thankfully becoming rare in areas with lots of kids.
