I feel your pain; I live in central OK and get to pretty regularly do the hide-in-bathtub-under-mattress shuffle when the sirens go off. We got lucky on Sunday, but I'm sorry that the front that skipped us rolled your way. That's the shitty thing about tornadic system: even when you're relieved that it didn't hit you, you still feel bad because it'll likely go on to hit somebody else. I hope you made it through the night with no damage!

(Unrelated: you lived in Tuscaloosa? I'm jealous! A favorite horror series of mine shoots there, I've always wanted to pass through and see the town in person.)
