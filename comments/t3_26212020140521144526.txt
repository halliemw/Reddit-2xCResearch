Since I live with a logician, and have taken classes in logic, actually the precepts of arguments are quite familiar to me.

That's why I'm so certain that *not everything has to be an argument,* which you fail to grok.

Go your way in peace, sir.  But deciding to insult me in your last post is not winning you a lot of friends.  If you can ever understand the differences between arguments, discussions, support talk, advice and the like, you will have gained a great deal of understanding that goes beyond your current, very linear point of view.  

BTW, your wikipedia cite argues against you.  Where do you see *any* emotion as a premise or a conclusion?  Why, you don't, do you?  P

You can't argue about other people's feelings (and in real life, everyone who does this is immediately on my real life ignore list.)  

I'd be very curious, rather than you citing silly things about validity in regard to feelings, how you deal with the fact that some people don't like you.  How do you deal with feelings in general?  Do you often find yourself arguing with others about their feelings?  How is that working for you?

Finally, a lot of what you just typed makes no sense to me (the part about spouses, for example).  I think you're in over your head with trying to apply "logic" (you aren't, really) to the discussion at hand.  

You obviously know nothing about the therapy for eating disorders.  No good therapist ever tells the anorectic that her feelings are wrong.  It astonishes me (that's a feeling) that you would believe this.
