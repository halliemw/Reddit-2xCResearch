I feel the need to advocate the devil because maybe, sometimes, I'd like to just see a movie without this subreddit telling me I should hate it because it doesn't represent me. Sometimes I just want to be entertained and not have the feminist agenda shoved down my throat. It's a fucking movie, not political law.
