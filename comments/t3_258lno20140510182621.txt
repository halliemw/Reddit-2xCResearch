I mentioned in my post that I saw my prescribing doctor then sought a second opinion. I also said that I was refused a pelvic exam.

I didn't say that I've been on the phone, on hold, with the afterhours clinic for my primary doctor all afternoon. I finally spoke to a registered nurse after three disconnects about ten minutes ago, and she said that she can only refer me to see someone if I bleed through two tampons in an hour for more than 24 hours. I didn't know it was possible to bleed that much without passing out, and I'm bleeding heavily but not that heavily.

Please believe me when I say that this website is my last resort and that I have tried desperately and repeatedly to be taken seriously by a doctor.

EDIT: I should also mention that two of the three clinics close to me are closed. The third had only an afterhours RN available, who was very kind but had to act under strict guidelines. She said that I was right to be frightened but that she is not able to refer me to a doctor or emergency room. She said that it is critical for me to see a physician within 72 hours but that there's nothing she can do until Monday.
