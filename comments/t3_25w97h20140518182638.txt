You are in a horrible cycle. I've been there too. It is time for you to decide if you want to change this. Because there is one way to change it, as far as I know, and that is to step back, take the situation into your own hands, and move on. Focus on other things, make priorities that don't include your boyfriend. One of the things that got me through this horrible cycle was to remind myself that this is my life. With or without my ex, I was going to make my life what I wanted it to be. And with him just wasn't working. This is a cycle caused by *both* of you, and it gets amazingly easier when the other person is no longer around to contribute to those feelings.
