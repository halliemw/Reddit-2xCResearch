Thank you! Part of her closing statement included, "Don't leave that situation feeling, 'Argh, I didn't show them who I am!'" Which is exactly how I'm feeling.  I'm going to be goofy and try that power pose. I wish it went a little further, because as she said you can't just stand around doing those poses haha. I will pay attention to be sure I'm not shrinking into myself.

You're awesome for providing exactly what I needed.

Side note: I love how she pulls of that purple lipstick!
