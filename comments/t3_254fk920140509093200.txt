regarding the barbie fairy with wings to draw on: As a little girl I would have enjoyed goldieblox but I loved barbies. Not because I wanted to be like barbie, but because they were a huge creative outlet. I'd make up all kinds of stories and act them out. as I got older, I made houses out of household objects and lego for them, and I started sewing my own clothes for them.  Don't write them off as a useless gift. Your niece might want that barbie because drawing on the wings sounds like a fantastic idea to her. Dolls don't have to be negative, and they can absolutely foster a passion for things other than being girly. I'm an artist. Being creative was important to me as a child, and I think I satisfied a huge part of my need to be creative through barbies. (and lego...)
