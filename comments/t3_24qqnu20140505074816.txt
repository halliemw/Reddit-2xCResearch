Parents like your father will exert as much control as you let them. If he cares about you, he isn't going to risk hurting his relationship with you by cutting you loose. You need to make it clear that it's your life, and that he can't micromanage it as he sees fit. It's possible I was raised in a different culture and don't appreciate the dynamics, but it seems to me that you need to demonstrate to your father that you're no longer a child by not complying with his wishes by default. Don't lie to him, but don't do what he says just because he says it. So long as he thinks he controls you, he's going to continue to think he needs to control you.
