as others stated, there are several factors including the amount of time someone was overweight.  i was over 250 (i'm 5'1") for 14 years.  eight of those years were spent over 275 and 4 of them over 300 so my body actually grew more skin, it's not just stretched.  my doctor says that the only way to get rid of what i've got is surgery.  it's not completely out of the question but not on the books for anytime soon. :)
