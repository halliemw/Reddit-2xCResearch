I used to use Venus razors all the time until it became a bit too expensive buying their disposables--I think I used each type once. They were OK.

Personally though I would suggest a Bic Soleil or Bic Soleil Bella. The Bella's are definitely the smoothest shave I've ever had on my legs, pits, and nether-regions, even compared to Venus razors. But you are right--don't go for the regular Bics, those things are terrible.
