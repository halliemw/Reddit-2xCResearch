EYYYY! Congrats! 
Just remember that even if you're cool with doing it, you don't always have to do it every time. It's okay to not feel like giving a blowjob. Just like it's okay to not feel like having sex. You get to decide what and when you do things. I'm very happy for you, though, because this is a big step for you c:
