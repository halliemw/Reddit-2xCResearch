YES! I was there two years ago and started therapy. I ended up doing about a month of talk therapy then working through a DBT workbook (on my counselors recommendation because I didn't have access to a counselor for the summer) then returning to do a year of talk therapy in the fall. It was fantastic and so worth it. I can't recommend therapy enough.
