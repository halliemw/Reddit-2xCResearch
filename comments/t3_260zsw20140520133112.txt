You sound like you respect him and his beliefs strongly. Also, it sounds like he loves you deeply.

I know that I have many really close friends who are not Christian, while I am. It doesn't mean they don't matter to me and I love them so so much. But I did have to draw the line at a romantic relationship. God is such a deep part of my life, not having the man I am with share that love would kill me. 

I am not saying you have to change for him, but it might be a deal breaker. And that hurts. I mean, if my husband had ever said he didn't want kids during our dating years, I would have broken it off. Even though I love him and respect him deeply. Some things are not negotiable.
