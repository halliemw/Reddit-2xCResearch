No problem.  I'm glad I can help in anyway possible.  First off I do just want to say that in no way am I qualified to give advice to someone. I can only take the knowledge I have gained from my studies to try and help. 

Since I believe this is a self esteem issue I don't think a health professional is needed by any means. You and the people closest to him will be of the most help and your words and actions will be your best tools. 

Here are some things you can do to build self estate. 

-compliment him no matter how small it may seem.  Tell him he's funny, smart, helpful, strong, ect. But don't overdue it. 

-be understating with him. Don't get mad over little things and don't get frustrated easily. Things take time and only time will help him get better and back to the person he is. 

-Be aware of him. I don't necessarily mean know when he is around, but rather try to realize when he is angry or sad. This will help you to control your emotions and know how to act in response. 

-include them in (almost) everything. Since I don't know the exact source of the problem it is a little hard to narrow this one down. Just make sure to have him with you when you try new things or meet new people.  

These last three may be the most important.  

-realize they may not be "themselves"
They might be a little moody, but that's because they are struggling with this and they don't really know what's going on and WHY they are feeling the way they are.  

-find out what is causing it. The more you know about the problem the better you can respond to his needs. 

-lastly, DO NOT baby him. If this is low self esteem that is the last things he wants is to be babied. Be straight forward with him.  He wants to be independent and wants to be able to handle things on his own.  This is no different.  

I hope I helped a little bit. Do not be afraid to reach out if you need anything.
