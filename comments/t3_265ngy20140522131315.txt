A "Trigger Warning" doesn't allow you the opportunity to form a different opinion - that's the problem with them. If you're uncomfortable about a topic, then you censor yourself from forming a different idea or belief.

It's not about protecting "feelings" it's about letting the uneducated stay uneducated in the name of being "comfortable."
