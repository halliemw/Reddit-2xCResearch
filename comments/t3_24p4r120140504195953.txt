There's a flood of good information, and I just wanted to add to find what you love about yourself! You'll never get anywhere if you hate your body and yourself so much. Every person on the planet has a weird flabby bits and weird boney bits and ugly parts because that's what bodies are made of. That's not who you are, and the body you've got is still amazing and sexy. 

Try to think of lifestyle, not immediate diet/ gym. Don't binge and crash, become happy with the activities you do. Can you get get a routine where you walk your dog twice a day? Or bike to and from work? Can you go vegan 1-2 days a week just to push yourself to find healthier meal options? Try to do things that you'll enjoy, don't punish yourself with workouts and diets that you'll resent and quit. Good luck!
