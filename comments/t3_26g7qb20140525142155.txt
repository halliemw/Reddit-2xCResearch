Oh yes!  So much!  I'll feel myself getting upset at something and just keep telling myself "it's really not that big of a deal, it's just your hormones being dumb, you wouldn't be upset at this if you weren't on your period" and it does nothing.  I get overwhelmingly upset at the thing and at myself for not being able to control my emotions and it does this death spiral where I have to lock myself away for a few hours (or a day or two) so I avoid blowing up on someone and cry uncontrollably.

It doesn't happen often, but when it does.. ?!?!?!?!?!
