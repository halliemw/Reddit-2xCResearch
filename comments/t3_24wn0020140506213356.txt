I am on my second mirena IUD. I can tell you that the first insertion went much smoother. I was given cervidil a day prior which softens the cervix and makes insertion easier. My second insertion I did not use the cervidil and it was extremely painful. However with the first IUD I was on bc up until the insertion but still had cramping for a few weeks and spotting for about 6 months. Then I had no period at all for the next 2.5 years until I had it removed. I kept it out for 6 months, not on bc at all, and then got the second. The insertion hurt and I had cramping for the rest of the day, but then no cramping, no periods and no complications since.
