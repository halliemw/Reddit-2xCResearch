I'm asking this because it seems like you are more open to dating in a professional setting.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong on that!)  
How do you deal with coworkers who see flirting directed at you?  Is your interaction with your coworkers different when you're interested in the flirty person? 
This is honestly the toughest part of the whole deal for me - I don't mind letting the flirter know I'm unavailable, but I still haven't worked out how to deal with coworkers during/after the situation.
