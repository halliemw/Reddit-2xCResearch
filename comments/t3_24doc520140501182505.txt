No argument there. However when Obama care was instituted it did a major number on Medi cal. California Eliminated Medi-cal except for the homeless. The people used to pay a reasonable co pay of $20 -$50 and were able to see a doctor when they needed it were suddenly being charged hundreds of dollars. I used to be able to go to Planned parenthood for free Pap smears. Now I'm in the system under share-of-cost Medi-cal and I have to pay $350 for one there, while people who aren't on share-of-cost can claim they have no insurance and get a Pap smear for free. FUCK THE SYSTEM.
