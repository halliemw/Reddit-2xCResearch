It's funny, I didn't realize people called each other sir and ma'am in real life until I got Sirius FM and listened to US talk radio. I was so bemused that everyone addressed each other with respectful titles but would interrupt, talk over, shout at or curse at each other. It seemed so contradictory!

In Canada (BC), most people call in, state their first name, and the radio host calls them by their first name throughout (equally the caller calls the radio host by his/her first name). There are no titles, no last names... it's all first names, regardless of who's talking. The only exceptions I can think of is when someone has a title (Judge, Dr., Premier, Police officer, military.) 

As a child, I was told to call adults Mrs._____ or Mr.____. Sometimes adults would say "Oh no, you can call me by my first name". And you did and felt terribly grown up doing so. This was (IMO) the norm for my  generation. My husband on the other hand, was encouraged to call his parents by their first names, and for the most part called adults by their first name, unless specifically asked to. He grew up 1 town over, but agrees that that was not the norm among his friends.
