I remember several times in high school, I told a friend who was clearly gay that it was okay to come out- we went to a performing arts school, everyone knew he was gay, he would be accepted without judgement, yadda yadda. Pretty much the same rhetoric as OPs parents. Being inexperienced with the subject, I learned later I was being an ass and apologized, but at the time I really thought that if I could get him to come out, he would be happier. He always seemed so out of place and depressed.

I was an asshole unintentionally. It really came from a loving place. He did eventually come out, and is now a gay radio personality, last I heard from him.

I don't think this goes do deep as white guilt. And I don't think it's fair to call them idiots. Insensitive, sure. This also seems like territory they have never been in.

OP is very young (who actually knows themselves at 21?), admits to being outside the normal stereotype, and her parents are misinterpreting her differences as being gay and in the closet. Her parents want her to be happy with herself, to experience her life fully, and probably feel she's hiding a part of herself from the world. She's obviously not, but they think they know better because she's young and hasn't explored her options.

Honestly, I would just tell OP to live her life. It will blow over, and she will be fine.
