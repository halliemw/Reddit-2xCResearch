Thank you. This is what I'd say to a friend. And myself, if I wasn't so distraught and grasping at straws. 

>As a point of interest, I'm concerned that it is strictly on you to convert rather than on him to explore outside his belief system. I would find this sort of thing unbearable. It's so core, how could someone I love expect me to alter such a fundamental part of myself for them without exploring the same option for themselves?

You're right. I'm willing to explore and he's not. Although I don't want him to change - he is who he is because of his beliefs, and that's the man I love. I love that he has faith, I think having faith is a lucky thing.
