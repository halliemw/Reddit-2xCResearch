We've been good friends since we were around 8-9 years old. We are now in our twenties :( 

I just feel like I have done something to her, she is *super* organized, so she always knows what's up for the day, every day. I almost think that she lied about that second thing, just to find an excuse for being angry or something..

It's just so very uncomfortable getting shamed like that, from a person that acted like it wouldn't be such a huge deal. It's just strange, and I also just wanted to know if I had ''the right'' to feel like I didn't deserve that, or to know if maybe I deserved that... :/
