I live near a very prominent cancer research center. The appointment is with their genetic counseling department. I already know about increased risk I have for some other cancers, due to some other medical issues I've had, so not sure if I would want to be screened for more. I know knowledge is power, but it's already rough mentally having to worry about what I'm worrying about. But who knows, maybe it'd bring peace of mind. 

My first appointment will have some cost involved, and my insurance will cover more/less things depending on my decisions there. That's part of the rough part is knowing that if I'm positive and want to opt for mastectomy I'm on a timeline to have it covered at as high a percentage as it will be with my parents insurance. It's highly unlikely I'll be able to afford insurance nearly as good as theirs for the foreseeable future. It kind of feels like a now or never thing.
