It's offensive to suggest that adoptive parents are somehow less than or not 'real' compared to bio-'parents'. I do deny the importance of biological family ties. Family isn't just biological so referring to adoptive families as merely social is a shockingly narrow view of family. 

You're seriously suggesting that my in-laws are not my husband's 'real' family. Ugh. That's just cruel.
