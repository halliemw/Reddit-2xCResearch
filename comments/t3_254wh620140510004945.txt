Thank you for those suggestions. I don't think I am in any way demanding to be educated, but I can see how others can be perceived as doing that. About that female perspective, the sidebar says this place is for everyone not just women. Are you saying that men should not post their perspectives because this is not the right place? I totally get not wanting some douchey male to come along and demand their perspective be given equal weight alongside everyone else's here. But I took the sidebar to mean this place is for people wanting to find a female perspective that anyone can add to (male/female/trans/ect). 

As a side note, I don't get why I am being downvoted. I guess it could be due to reddits voting algorithm but it's really frustrating to come into a new place asking general questions while being really polite and respectful and then to get downvoted for said question. I don't think you downvoted me or anything like that, it's just a trend I am seeing (and it's probably what others are seeing too for their comments) and I wish it would stop. We should all feel safe to ask questions here without feeling like the person asking the question is some horrible person.

Again, back to the main point, thank you for those subreddit suggestions.
