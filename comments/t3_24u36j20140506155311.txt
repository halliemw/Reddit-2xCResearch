i hear you - my twenties have been disappointing so far.  I've spent it doing low paying jobs, finishing school, and dealing with the fact that i had lupus at the same time I was diagnosed as bipolar.    I'm definitely behind my peers in life, but now my health is 100 percent better, I finished school and got an entry level job in my field, and though I'm still pretty unhappy, I can see that the next few years will finally be better.  I have reached the light at the end of the tunnel!
