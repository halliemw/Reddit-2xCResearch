I think part of it is just luck that my daughter hasn't seriously fallen for anyone yet... she's a bit cynical about people's intentions, and very stubborn.


Making some medicine changes helped when things seemed to stop working, but the biggest help seems to be the therapist we got. Not every day is amazing and fun, but we're identifying what triggers my daughter to slip back and finding ways for her to learn to deal with them.
