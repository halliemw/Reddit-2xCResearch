I hope you let the nurse's superiors know about that. I am in nursing school and I hate hearing stories like this--in class and clinical the idea of patient dignity is always of HUGE importance! Yes, cleaning would be much easier without the foley in but she definitely could have given you a bed bath, cleaned up your legs/thighs at least, and changed the sheets without you getting up.
