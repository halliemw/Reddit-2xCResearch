So they said they she is moving away from stereotype of what women in music are, essentially giving others a role model to break away from the "Hollywood" style female musician, and it's offensive?  Potentially giving young female musicians proof that you don't have to give in to stereotypes to have success is something that should be mentioned. If it's ok to have female only college scholarships, and "women in business" recognition, why wouldn't you want this?
I'm guessing the source. If this had been someone other than Playboy, I do t think we would have heard about it.
