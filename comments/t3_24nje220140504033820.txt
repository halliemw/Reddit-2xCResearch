Yep! Estrogen is one of the hormones that causes the [epiphyseal plate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyseal_plate) in bones to cease growth, which results in shorter height and other complications if too much estrogen is pumped into the system early on.

This is true in both men and women, and it is hypothesized that this is one of the reasons that most women are shorter than most men. Mainly, the reason is that women simply have more estrogen than men, which causes this mechanism to inhibit bone growth to activate earlier.
