I don't want you to think that I'm being cruel. I promise you I'm not. 

I think at this point in your life, with everything you are dealing with, you should get a therapist, counselor, or someone you can talk to. Not a boyfriend. 

I'm not sure if your mom was being intentionally rude, or if she just says one of the stupid things moms sometimes say, but I really think that you need to take care of yourself instead of hiding this all away.
