Yeah they're closer to cloth then tp or paper towel.  It takes a few years to break down unless the conditions are just right.   On camping trips I just let them dry and burn them.   Roll a ball of wax in the middle of one and you have a nice fire starter that will even get fire going with wet kindling.
