The primary demographic for action comics is (pre-) adolescent males. Most young males enjoy seeing physically attractive female characters depicted in sexually suggestive costumes/poses.

This is not sexist or absurd, just properly targeted marketing. Similar but opposite focus can be seen in any (pre-) teen female-oriented print media (Seventeen, Teen Vogue, etc.).
