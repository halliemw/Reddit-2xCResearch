Yay! Another person who started at the same age as me! 

On the flip side, while you said you did it because it was "fun" and didn't know it was sexual, I tried it at first because I'd read a book that had female masturbation and wanted to know HOW that could possibly be nice... Needless to say, I didn't wonder long and quickly started doing it regularly.

But when I got to the age when I finally learned from my peers that it wasn't normal, I had the same thoughts and doubts as you did, but I gave in to them and stopped for a while. Thankfully, though, I just gave up on being "acceptable" after a few months and continued my habits without regret. 

I agree so much with the wish that every girl could discover it like that, because it really does help in relieving what society teaches about masturbation. I'm not ashamed to talk about sex and masturbation now because I learned that it was natural and it's been integrated into my life for so long.
