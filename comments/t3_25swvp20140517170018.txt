One of my most pivotal relationships was with someone facing very similar issues as yourself, at first I was absolutely blown away not only by the amount of harassment she faced on a daily basis, everywhere it even got to the point where WE were being harassed (I'm 6'2" 200lbs and my assumed profession is LE Military) And I urge you to stand defiant. Dress the way YOU WANT, granted a self defense class is always a nice one to have in the pocket (I recommend Moi Tai). But the bottom line is you should not have to stand for any form of persecution from anyone. SA far as the gym goes I would recommend finding a BIG (gender irrelevant) friend to accompany you, preferably to their regular gym where they know the patrons and have a rapport. That being said in my city we have female only gyms. Anyways the take away from my rambling rhetoric;
- The adversity you face will probably never go away, however this is by no means your creation or fault, never let anyone tell you otherwise.
- You have the inalienable right to dress as YOU see fit.
- Will it is true you may have to exercise a little more caution due to your looks, you should never apologise or be ashamed of them.
- Most importantly the people immediately around you are the most important, it is essential that they support you even when you feel society does not. A strong group of friends who you trust is very important. 
A little side note on the bars as I find this to be the most problematic area. When I go out with my friends I usually get relegated to the guardian role, (because apparently rubbing you junk on someone is an acceptable form of saying hi) I have come to terms with this. I would rather maintain my sobriety than have anything happen to them. And I have a few scars to show for it. Unfortunately this is the reality of our situation, it might be yours as well. that doesn't mean you should change any of the way your dress, act, stay fit ect. ect.
TL;DR you woke up like dis.
