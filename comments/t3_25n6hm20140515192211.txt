If it is in a situation where they are in a car or moving away from me too rapidly to respond. You sort of just shrug. They're cowards.


If it's while I'm walking by and they're sitting on a bench or something, I walk more slowly, but continue to act like I don't hear them. Drives them crazy. Just looking at them is enough to give them the acknowledgment that they want, but if you keep staring straight ahead but take your time and continue to be in their presence, you challenge their territorial, stupid behavior.
