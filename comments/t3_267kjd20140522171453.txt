omg, I hope I have similar results. I was pretty sure I was normal and stuff--especially since my parents had always pinned me as the "moody" one--that this was just who I was. But now I'm like seeing how my reactions and stuff are way out of line from what a real person should do? Like I burst out sobbing because my boyfriend accidentally locked me out? Or at breaking a screw for some Ikea furniture? When I took a step back and looked at that objectively (with the help of my poor bff who was witness to both events), I realized I was probably not Right in the Head and needed to try something new. Sorry for the overshare but writing this all out does really help with reflection...

So anyway, congrats on the clarity!
