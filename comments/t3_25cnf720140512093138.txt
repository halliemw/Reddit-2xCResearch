I don't put all of my self esteem stock into appearances. I do self compliment my appearance or my outfits or my makeup, but I also compliment the kind of person I am and my accomplishments.  I am the kind of person that I want to be, and that means a lot to me.

I also take the route of "good enough."  I'm pretty enough to be pleased with myself. I'm successful enough to be secure. I'm happy enough to live my life with positive mental attitude.

Being "good enough" awakens the determined, unsinkable woman in me.  I may not have it all, but I'll be damned if it keeps me from building my life as I see fit and being proud and thankful for what I've got.
