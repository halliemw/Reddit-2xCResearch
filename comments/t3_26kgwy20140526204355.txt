Don't spend you life being a caretaker for this guy.  Best case scenario for him might actually be you leaving.  Could be the impetus that he needs to fix his life.  Why would he change when there's no threat of anything to lose?  When you break up with him, be quick and succinct. Start by hiding the gun when he's away, then sitting him down and doing it as soon as he comes home. Tell him exactly why (you can leave open the possibility of getting back together if he changes, if you want), then leave as quickly as you can.  Have a destination planned out in advance, ie: parents.  If he threatens suicide, call 911 and let the pros deal with it.  You are not trained to deal with someone threatening suicide.  All you can do is give in to him, teaching him how to manipulate you.  Best of luck.
