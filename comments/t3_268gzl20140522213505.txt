When I was researching the IUD I was completely freaked out by the side effects and bad stories I had read (not on reddit) about the hormonal one. I didn't want the paraguard because of the excess bleeding. I decided to give Skyla (a smaller version of Mirena for women who haven't had children) a chance anyway and I'm so glad that I did! I had some slight irritation for a month, but since then I've been loving it! I have 2 day periods with some cramps, but pretty light flow. It was also nice my insurance covered it and I only had to pay $100 for the insertion appointment.
