Agreed. There is a lot of tension over tribal sovereignty and the rights that entails, and many times those rights are curtailed by the US government's misunderstandings of Native history and cultures. Though I don't study Native American history, I have read many books about it in graduate school. It's very complicated, but incredibly important to understand. The language of the "uncivilized, unsophisticated Indian" continues in our political rhetoric today.
