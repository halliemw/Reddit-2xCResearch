So Japan has a weird history with the pill. It was only legalised in 1999, and it seems like the whole culture around it is a bit messed up, and condoms are widely used and encouraged instead ([according to this site](http://finedays.org/pill/e/)).

Lunabell is another name for ortho m-21 which is definitely a contraceptive. I think the confusion around it is maybe they want a pill they can prescribe for something else (dysmenorrhea wink wink) while it actually does work as a contraceptive?
