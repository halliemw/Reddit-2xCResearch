There seems to be something of a double standard when it comes to "objectification."

At my workplace, I regularly overhear female coworkers loudly going on about how hot X or Y male celebrity is and how nice his body is, etc.  If any of my male coworkers openly talked that way about any female celebrity they would be written up for sexual harassment.

I don't think my female coworkers are wrong, I just object to the double standard.  I'm of the opinion that everyone should lighten up about such things.
