Thank you for saying this.

I was downright pissed at that comment, no matter how much "I don't mean to be insulting" coating she slathered it in - I am not overweight, but I still have lots and lots of hangups about my body.

I hate being told that my emotions about my body aren't legitimate just because "*you*" think I look good. 

This isn't about who looks better - it's about accepting the fact we all struggle.

And I can sure as shit guarantee that anyone who says "you already have the perfect body we all strive for" - if they had that exact body, they would still have a host of hang-ups about their body.
