It's the little tiny reddish region right in the middle of my left labia. Yeah, hard to see kinda. Lumps and bumps can be normal in the vagina, and you can have these things called vestibular papillae. They're a normal anatomical variation, but can actually appear after you've experienced inflammation (such as a yeast infection, irritation to lubricants/condoms, etc). I wouldn't worry.
