Nothing, really. I don't like how my body looks and how it works against me (not wanting children and not wanting to be fertile). I don't like the fact that it's weaker than a man's body. I don't like society's expectations for women, and I don't like womanly things.

The only thing I don't mind is seeing outside of the paradigm created by men. i have a feeling that, were I a guy, it'd be like living in the Matrix - I would just go on happily about and never think of things that happen to women on a daily basis. I wouldn't be as self-aware or as self-analytical as I am now. I might've even been a patriarchal asshole. Ew.
