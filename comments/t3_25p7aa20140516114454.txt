Discussion is not debate. Argumentative comments, no matter how well crafted or free of obvious slurs, are irrelevant here and that's why I downvote them. It's true that the rest of Reddit is full of disembodied people yelling at each other, but until now 2X and the other women-oriented subs have been mostly free from that. I'm sorry (not sorry) for the anti-feminists who have found this place for the first time and mistake it for /r/screamatfeminists, but I don't think women, feminist or not, want to hear them. Antifeminism is all over Reddit. We've heard it all before, and I at least have no interest in hearing it here too.
