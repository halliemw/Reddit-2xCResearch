I don't know of it's just me or what, but 20-30 years ago this was not even thought most people's heads. Vulvas like like snowflakes, they're all unique and it's all good. I think with the prevalence of the Internet and all these pornographic images we have floating around that were just being exposed to a lot more lady box than ever before. I never even heard of labioplasty until 1998, and that was only for reconstruction. 

I bet solid money that you are fine. To quote one of my old guy friends, he's just happy that a woman he likes will get naked for him. In fact most men are happy to just be with a woman in a sexual context, they are way less harsh and a lot more forgiving of our flaws than we are ourselves.  

As for him, you're saying he has little to no sexual experience. What kind of an asshole would he be if he said terrible things to you his first chance of touching your business. My advice is to talk about your insecurities with him, & why you're holding back. I'm sure if he's the guy you say he is he will be supportive & kind. It will be ok, there's a first time for everything :)
