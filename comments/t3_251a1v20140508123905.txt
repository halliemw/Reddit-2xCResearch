I agree with you so much but I think that one of the problems with a minimuim wage and living wage is all the smaller companies who survive by paying employees the minimuim wage. If they had to increase wages they may have to cut jobs. This leads to less jobs and higher needs of full government assistance. I think if they could force larger companies to pay a living wage, while keeping a minimuim wage, then many people would be better off while keeping job levels steady. All though this is probably never going to happen and either way the working class will suffer.
