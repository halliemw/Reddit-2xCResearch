Being obese is unhealthy. It is a fact, nobody will convince me that a person that is out of breath after walking for 15 minutes or climbing a flight of stairs is healthy. Also, every single person I know that lived to their 90's was normal weight, I know no obese person that lived for so long. To change your body, you just need to be honest about your eating habits and eat less ( below your TDEE ), no freakin' research is needed, what you said implies that losing weight is only possible with some ,,effective treatments'' - it already exists - put down the fork and do some cardio, laws of physics will make sure that no energy is magicially created and it will be taken out of the fat cells in your body. Fat people who are ok with being fat are awesome, fat people who deep inside hate their body (majority afaik) and blame society and social stigmas for their situations are not. Humans are supposed to be fit.
