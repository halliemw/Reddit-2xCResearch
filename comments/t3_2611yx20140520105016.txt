Thank you for such an interesting reply. I did not know how bad it could be for them. However, I don't know how to feel about what you've pointed out. I try to be helpful to them and to simply do my work. I can't help that I'm young or how I look. I wish I could ask for the mean staring, personal comments and condescending ways to stop, but I know I can't, because I'm almost certain that this will only make things worse. What would you do?
