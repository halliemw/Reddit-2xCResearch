I really started noticing it around 30, but that could be because I was worrying about aging and more conscience of it.  I'm 35 now and have basically accepted my fate as a mam.  It doesn't bother me too much anymore.  I do love when an old person calls me miss or young lady though.  When I'm old I'm going to say that to all the middle aged people just to make their day.
