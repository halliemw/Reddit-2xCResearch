Eh, my current boyfriend isn't a needy puppy, I just have trouble believing the truth there. And my ex wasn't when we got together, but we both were at times in the relationship. 

I'm not without fault. But I never lied. And that is so important to me. 

And what I know doesn't help what I feel. Like I'm being blamed for him treating me so poorly. Like I'm the crazy one and I'm the problem.
