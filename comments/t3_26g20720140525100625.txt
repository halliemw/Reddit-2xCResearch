Pretend there is a vertical line at the outer corner of your nose, the outer corner of your eye, and where your pupil is. Your eyebrow should begin on the line where the outer corner of your nose is, and end on the line where the outer corner of your eye is. The arch should reach its highest spot on the line where your pupil is. 

For the first time, I would go ahead and have them professionally waxed, especially for your wedding. They look so good then, and it is easy to maintain. Take a picture of your face after it is done, so you can see where the lines are, and refer to it for future tweezes. Otherwise, $10 at the salon isnâ€™t a bad deal for routine wax maintenance!
