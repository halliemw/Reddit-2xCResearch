It might be ok to listen to that voice, if you are doing so for the right reasons. Let it guide what you do, rather than regret what you've done.

Having sex is risky for your physical and mental health. Not all STDs are preventable by condoms, and it is hard not to get emotionally attached to people you sleep with. This doesn't mean there should be anything "dirty" or "unpure" about having sex, but it is risky. 

Your number is just a number, and it means nothing. Having had casual sex does not make you a bad person, and if you can do it without regret, go have fun, and enjoy yourself.

However, if you are going on a date, and before the date and the spur of the moment, ask yourself if sex will bring you fleeting vs lasting happiness. If you don't want to have sex before the date, waiting a few dates won't stop a great partner from wanting to be with you. Having sex on the first date also won't stop a great partner from wanting to be with you. 

I just think that if casual sex doesn't make you happy, that is also ok to realize. Just ask yourself why you feel bad. If it's because you think external forces want you to feel bad, than it's silly. If you decide you personally want sex to just be for love, than that is a suitable reason to not participate in casual sex. 

Either way, have fun, be safe, and try to make all your decisions with the lights on and with your clothes on.
