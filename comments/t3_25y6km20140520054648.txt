Did they die of natural causes?  If abortion is illegal (because we are talking about a hypothetical place that treats it as murder), then how can you be sure there wasn't foul play?  Perhaps some pills got shipped to them to induce an abortion.  Perhaps they purposely poisoned themselves to cause a miscarriage.  Oh, it probably was an accident, but you have to investigate it.  Also, even if it was an accident, if it was caused by negligence, it is still a crime.
