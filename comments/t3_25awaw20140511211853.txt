There's nothing wrong with just following up and asking a few questions such as:
1) Is my case still active?
2) If you had been to the hospital, "Was the sex crime kit (or any other evidence) submitted to the crime laboratory for testing?
3) If it was submitted, "Can you check on the status at the lab and/or did you receive a report?"
The most important thing to make sure is that someone is still aware of it and it isn't buried in someone's files.  Sometimes officers can even transfer or retire, which can cause things to fall between the cracks.

Also another reason to ask is because in some cities/states, as disgusting as it may be, there exists a statute of limitations with sexual assault cases.  Most places are changing their laws, but you want to make sure that there isn't a time limit on this.
