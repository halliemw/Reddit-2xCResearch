Since she is so young, encourage her to be independent! Let her do things on her own, teach her how to deal with the little problems that life will throw at her like unclogging a sink or changing a tire. Feed her self esteem with encouragement and just general dad type love. Life is hard as a woman, and sadly, she will experience plenty, but if you give her the tools she needs to handle them, she will be fine. Coming here and asking shows you're on the right track anyway, so go you!!
