Look, I used to cut when I was your age. I ran out of room on my arms. I have first hand experience with this. I had sex at 13. I don't regret it, but I certainly didn't have "good" sex until I was 18 or so.

Cleaning your knives doesn't negate the cutting. Eating healthy foods doesn't mean you're mentally healthy. Your assertion that getting sexually assaulted is part of becoming a woman isn't healthy.

Some people are just legitimately concerned for your well-being. Just because you think youve got it all figured out doesn't mean you can't accept a little support or advice from others.
