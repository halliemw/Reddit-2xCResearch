I know what you mean. And while I think it's more effective to have cast someone who's more A-list (and who has played an actual superhero, something intentional for this video, I think), they also could have had Laverne Cox star in the video, another prominent actor. I do believe that it's harder to write off though just because he is an A-list, white, cishet male, and more easily sparks conversation.
