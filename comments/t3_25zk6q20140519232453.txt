I don't think 15 year old girls should be called women. Just like I don't think 15 year old boys should be called men. I suppose it's just personal experience. Perhaps ladies would be better for a mixed group?

Either way, I know many girls that hate being referred to as women. I assume because aging is an unfavorable inevitability for the fairer sex. Whereas males love to be called men because it is seen as a positive regardless of age.
