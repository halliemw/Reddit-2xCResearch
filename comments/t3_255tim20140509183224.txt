I get where you're coming from but I guess im just tired of people being grossed out by body parts in general. It's a body. We all have one. The end. Idk I was raised in a really laid back "scientific" type household and I've never been able to understand society's issues with the body. Granted there are plenty of other things about society I don't get either but this just rubbed me the wrong way today.
