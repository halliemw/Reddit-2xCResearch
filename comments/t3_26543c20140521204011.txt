Not realistic? This shit was downright common when my mother was working and we are very fortunate today to have protection against it in the workplace. You do not hear about it because of the fear women have of 'making waves' in the office or losing their job, and sometimes a stiff upper lip is all we have. Yes, some women speak out- but a huge number do not for fear of retaliation. 

Sometimes the higher-ups who deal with disciplining are just as sexist as the perpetrators, but they weren't the ones who put the rules in place so they think it's 'making a big deal out of nothing' when it really is about women needing and deserving respect and dignity in the workplace.

And why is wanting to educate someone about an experience totally alien to their own in order to keep them from pulling the same shit day in and day out to other women 'Mary Sue' behaviour anyway? How do you benefit from assuming this is a troll at all?
