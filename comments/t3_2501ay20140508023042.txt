This seems like an extreme move to take before simply sitting down and talking about the issue. 

I'm not trying to defend the guy in any way, but to secretly record him in order to sue him *just* in case anything goes wrong is overkill. It might even *cause* the situation to go wrong if found out.

Hardly anyone is even considering that it might have been a mistake or misunderstanding on his part that a calm conversation could fix. While he may have refused to let her see his phone in the heat of the moment when emotions are high, that doesn't mean he's planning on broadcasting it to the world.

I would suggest talking about it first and explaining why it was so creepy, why it lost her trust, and why he shouldn't do it again even to other women.

If it still isn't resolved through that, *then* she needs to take this next step and try to resolve it through other means.
