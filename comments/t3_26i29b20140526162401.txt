I've said it first in both of my relationships, both of which were roughly 5 months in.

I know this will be unpopular, but it makes me feel shitty that no one has ever had the courage to say it to me first. I've always longed to hear the words first but I just get so tired of waiting, so I say it first. Does anyone else have experience like this?
