Congrats on the closure and kudos for the strength it took to go through the trial! Sorry it took 5 years to get the guy (and that he was a friend :/) - I suppose they might have had to wait for him to commit a crime to get his DNA? No idea how that works in the US. They got him in the end though. :)

All the best! :)
