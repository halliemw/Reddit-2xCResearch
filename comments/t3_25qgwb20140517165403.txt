Yeah that's just disgusting, but at least it's something you expect, you know, even if you shouldn't have to. At least you could prepare by having a throwaway because you knew they would act like that. Like when I go to a bar or a club and I'm dressed up and wearing makeup, I hate getting stupid, shitty comments from guys but at least I expect it and can be prepared. Other times though, you just can't because you can't even conceive of something so idiotic - like when someone honked at me and called me a "cumdumpster" from their pickup truck, almost giving me a heart attack, while I was walking to the bus stop in freaking snow pants and a winter jacket. I didn't think I'd need a throwaway account to talk about hair shedding lol
