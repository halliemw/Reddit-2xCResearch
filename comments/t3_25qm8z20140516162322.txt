Dude, do not worry about it!  
Laugh it off, maybe deliver some ear plugs and cookies or something to your neighbors with a silly note?    
My upstairs neighbor vacuums really loudly at all hours and I talk about it with others on occasion, but trust me, I don't think about it until the noise starts back up again! (I am sure the same can be said for the sex sounds)
