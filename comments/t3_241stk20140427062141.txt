I had my undergraduate degree from one of the top research university in the U.S. for biomedical research and so biology and math is exactly where I specialized in! To answer your question using my personal experience, you probably won't face any outward/overt discrimination in the lecture setting but there will be some levels of "paranoia" in labs and project settings...that you are being excluded since the classes are so male-heavy so it might feel like a big "old boys club." You can overcome this feeling by diving into your studies and connect (as fellow-student to fellow-student) with your classmates...you gotta tell yourself that you are just as smart as any of them and apply yourself so that you can hold your own as a valuable teammate/classmate. Though I will say that there are small things that isn't all that fair, where you get penalized somewhat for being a girl: for example if you decide to wear a cute dress or anything trendy you will look quite out of place and get judged, also if you try to ask too many questions/help from your male classmates people might not take you seriously because they assume you are there to steal answers/be useless. In the end though the STEM programs are grueling on EVERYBODY and it comes down to finding the right support network and the right mindset to tackle it.
