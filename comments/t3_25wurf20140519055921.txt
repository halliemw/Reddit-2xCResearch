don't forget to actually get yourself checked professionally. For all you know you could fit a slightly different category, or not have certain symptoms 'severely' enough to qualify, etc.. I say this because there's quite a few people on the net that seem to self diagnose themselves and then use 'aspergers' as an excuse to be a dick. kinda makes the rest of us look bad. D:
