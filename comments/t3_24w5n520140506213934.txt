These publications are trying to make money. Does Shape really care about women's fitness? I mean really? They're trying to turn a buck and they're worried about their advertisers and revenue.

God forbid they show an actual representation of what happens when a person loses a great deal of weight (with the accompanying stretch marks and excess skin). Shape wants to show someone who was obese and now looks just like a supermodel! Too bad that's not reality; this is the real reality, and kudos to the lady in the story for getting so fit. That's more inspiring to me than seeing some hot tight body. But I digress...

It's really more a reflection on the sorry state of mainstream media in its representation of reality. I actually do sort of feel bad for the reporter. She actually is the middle person in this situation (if she wants to keep her job or have a stand off with her bosses). 

I'm not trying to defend Shape's decision; it's disgusting. But the reality of mainstream media, especially those that claim to represent women and a 'healthy body image'.
