There's always going to be tension between the ideas of 'creating a safe place to go' and 'making society a safe place to be.'  TwoX going default will absolutely make this a less safe place for trans women, as will as others; however, there's reason to hope that being exposed to TwoX will make the rest of Reddit a slightly safer place overall.

I don't know how to balance those goals, either ethically or pragmatically; clearly the mods have made a decision towards the latter aim, and I do hope it works out.
