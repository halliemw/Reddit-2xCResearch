'prime of life' is one of those fairy tale things propagated by the media.  There is no prime, there are just different life stages.  LIfe will throw different curve balls at everyone, and everyone has ups and downs at different points in life.  One thing I learned about life is never to wait until things beginning to get better or change, before I 'start my REAL life' or start 'really living'.  Life is happening NOW.   Act accordingly.  You need to find ways to be happy and content in every stage of life instead of waiting for the next goal or accomplishment :)
