I found this really difficult to watch.

I am pro-choice and glad it was an easy procedure, but I am disappointed that she wasn't ready for a child, worked in a clinic, and didn't use birth control. 

I had a hard time watching because it looked a little uncomfortable but it was easier to watch that a birth video. 

I'm more for birth control to prevent abortions. 

Edit: I meant I was disappointed that she had the knowledge and still chose not to use protection, especially since she wasn't ready for children. I'm not disappointed in her decision, and it was the right one for her.
