A part of me wildly appluases your restraint in that situation, im carrying a (capable well sized) knife as well for purposes other then stabbing people ...but i know i couldnt had restrained myself.....

Another part of me thinks "damn another got away" ;)

Best of luck leaving that experience behind :)
