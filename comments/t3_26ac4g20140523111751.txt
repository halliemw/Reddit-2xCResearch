So why base it on gender when fitness can be variable depending on a range of conditions including age, height, weight, etc.?

Edit: Also, since I honestly don't know, do they test both cardio/endurance and strength sperately or is it one specific test per gender? Obviously both are important when speaking for jobs like firefighter and lifeguard, but I don't understand a minimum requirement difference for strength in passing a test. There should be a set weight you need to be able to lift in your job (expected weight of a drowning child for a lifeguard or average weight of a senior citizen for a firefighter as random examples). What difference does your gender make in this regard?
