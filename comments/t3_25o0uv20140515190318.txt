I proposed to my wife only a few months after meeting her. I was a young sailor on leave and she was in Miami, FL on vacation with some friends. We were married the next year. We celebrated our 50th anniversary last year. We have 3 daughters and 7 grandchildren. You'll get out of a relationship what you are willing to put into it.
