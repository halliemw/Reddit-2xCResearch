Even if she can't go all the way through to obtaining the RO, having the sheriff deliver the first part of the message (which she has a right to do in all 50 states) can be a wake up call for the recipient.  

However, where I live, one need not go anywhere near police to get a restraining order.  Our D.A. has set up a fast track, counseling-based approached to RO's if they involve boyfriends, dates, partners, etc.  Something worth fighting for (not for OP, but for those of us in a position to be lobbying about such things or voting on the D.A. elections).
