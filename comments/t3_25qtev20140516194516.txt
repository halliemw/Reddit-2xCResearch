I agree. It depends on where you live, but I know for a fact that if you're in the US or Canada you can't consent to sex when you're drunk, so legally you could sue him for sexual assault. On top of that, you could also use the argument that you would not have consented to sex if he didn't use a condom. A [similar case happened in Nova Scotia](http://cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/condom-piercer-loses-supreme-court-appeal-1.2563227) where a man was found guilty of sexual assault because the woman was under the impression that he was using a reliable condom.

You mentioned that your ex is manipulative and wants a baby, and was mad at an ex for getting an abortion. This sort of makes me think that maybe he purposely didn't use a condom, and didn't tell you about it within the time frame for being able to use Plan B, because he actually wanted you to get pregnant. If he's been actively trying to get back together with you, it could be that he thought getting you pregnant would be a surefire way to trap you into a relationship.
