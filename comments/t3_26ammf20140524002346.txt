You should probably pop over to ELI5. As an American though:

Labour: Moderate left wing. Democratic Socialists, but they've largely dropped that in favor of making the Tory's their bitch because they might be able to pull that off

Conservatives (commonly called the "Tory's"): ideologically similar to the Republican Party, but not as obstructionist/likely to commit treason and call then themselves the god and country party

Liberal-Democrats: ideologically similar to the Democrats, often just as useless, but the British Parliament requires a party hold a majority or be part of a majority coalition to create a government. Because the UK has about eighty million political parties it often comes down to Labour and the Tory's having a large share of the seats, but not enough to make a government. Both then suck off the Lib-Dems that becomes a king maker and gets to decide who gets a chance to fuck up the UK for an unstated amount of time while ignoring the Lib-Dems

Those are the big three. Outside of them you have various parties that represent individual regions (mostly Scotland and Wales, but also Cornwall and Northern Ireland) and some single issue parties (the Greens who a Green party, and UKIP). A larger one is UKIP, the UK Independence Party, who want very much to free the UK from the oppressive tyranny of the EU that wants to do awful things like help Europe have a better continent-wide economy. A number of UKIP uppers are associated with groups like the BNP, the British National Party, who are notable mainly for being right wing nutjobs that hate everyone that isn't from the UK and non-white people that they tried to keep from joining their party and plan on forcibly deporting no matter how long they've actually been in the UK.
