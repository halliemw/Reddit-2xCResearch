Except that doesnt seem to be the case here, not only does NYTimes seem to have nearly double the stock price it did when she started in 2011: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nyt/interactive-chart

But studies have proven this exact gendered phenomena exists independent of newspapers not doing well:

From the NY times story: 

>“She confronted the top brass,” one close associate said, and this may have fed into the management’s narrative that she was “pushy,”

From http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/29/AR2007072900827.html

>"Their study, which was coauthored by Carnegie Mellon researcher Lei Lai, found that men and women get very different responses when they initiate negotiations. Although it may well be true that women often hurt themselves by not trying to negotiate, this study found that women's reluctance was based on an entirely reasonable and accurate view of how they were likely to be treated if they did. Both men and women were more likely to subtly penalize women who asked for more -- the perception was that women who asked for more were "less nice". "

>"What we found across all the studies is men were always less willing to work with a woman who had attempted to negotiate than with a woman who did not," Bowles said. "They always preferred to work with a woman who stayed mum. But it made no difference to the men whether a guy had chosen to negotiate or not."
