I see where you're coming from, but unless her friend has a history of compulsive lying and/or self-harm that would leave bruises, it seems more likely that this guy is abusive.

OP has said he has a history of controlling behavior and alcoholism, which are often correlated with abuse.

Additionally, abuse victims will often refuse to seek help from the police and/or to press charges. They "love" their abusers, and so don't want to hurt them, and they're often convinced that their abusers will change.
