I know nothing about what your going through, but how people treat you in highschool doesn't really matter everyone is mean and rude, don't let it get too you or affect your self esteem. And I can say as an older brother that if anyone in highschool picked on my little sister they'd be looking for their teeth for the rest of the year and your brother is probably no different, family is family.
