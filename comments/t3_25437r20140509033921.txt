Aw congratulations!! You deserve it.

If you don't mind me asking, what did you major in and how did you come to choosing it? I'm just asking because your past situation sounds a bit similar to my current problems. It's been 3 years of anxiety and also failed classes. Your post was just really inspiring- seeing someone who went through something similar to have succeeded :)
