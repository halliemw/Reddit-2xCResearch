A LOT of guys buy into the stigma that counseling means the relationship is headed to divorce. A LOT of guys resist counseling at first. It puts them in a place where it feels like the relationship is out of control.

Most guys that I know that went to counseling end up loving it, even though they questioned the notion and resisted the concept at first.

Asking somebody to *try* something to improve their relationship is generally not a very big ask. If my husband thought us going bungee-jumping would improve our relationship, I would give it a try, despite being afraid of heights.
