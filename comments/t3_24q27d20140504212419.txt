Not trying to scare you, but this is what my ex did before becoming abusive. I have always had mostly male friends and he'd accuse me of cheating when I hung out with them after a long while just saying he'd prefer me not hang out with them. He did the whole accusing me of being naive thing too, would sometimes say I did it because I didn't care about him...if he can't accept that your friends happen to be male, I'd be a bit concerned about jealosy. Does he want you to just have no friends? Seems like you're doing all the giving and he's doing all the taking.
