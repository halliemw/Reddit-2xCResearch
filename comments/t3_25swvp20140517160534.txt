I never said I agree with it. Racial stereotypes are unfortunately still prevalent today. But I wouldn't try to demand the society to change overnight because it takes time as we see minorities who break the stereotypes. 

In the mean time, if I were black I would try to dress as well as possible when I apply for a job because it's the most PRACTICAL thing to do. What's not practical is to expect other people to be logical and judge you for who you really are, because that's not happening any time soon.

Now I would appreciate if we rely on logical arguments, which you have done in the first two paragraphs, instead of ad hominem which you touched on lightly at the end.
