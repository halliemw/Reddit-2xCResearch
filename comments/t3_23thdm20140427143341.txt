> sometimes you just flat out don't want to go to work, and if it requires an excuse, well, that sucks

My opinion is that using another person's comparatively much larger misfortune (death of relative) to make a personal petty non-issue (not wanting to go to work) much better is disrespectful and dishonorable. IMO sympathy is not benefitting from someone else's misfortune.


Of course I can understand why someone wouldn't agree or care. I wouldn't want that in a partner.
