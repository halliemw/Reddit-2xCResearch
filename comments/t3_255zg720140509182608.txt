This is an awesome idea, pantherfuzz, and something I hadn't thought of at all. 

I've known her for 20 years, and it wasn't until a year or two ago that I found out that she has a special box that she saves all the little notes I've left her over the years...  

It breaks my damn heart to realize that I won't be able to leave her those anymore, that I won't be the one to sit next to her in the rocking chair, the one that squeezes her hand as our child walks down the aisle, or as they graduate, or as they talk about their hopes and dreams. 

Thanks again for the ideas.  Know that in some way, your words in this moment may help a woman reeling from loss.
