I was in a class with a mentally challenged dude who exhibited some of the same behaviours. We were in a computer lab all day and he would frequently go off task and look at inappropriate pictures on the computer and rub the front of his pants. 

It took several reports and finally an instructor catching him in the act for them to accommodate his disability and give him a private room to work in. Please report this behaviour! I know you're concerned about getting him in trouble, but he might not get in trouble, he might just get accommodations for his disability. Sometimes positive actions cannot be taken without documentation.
