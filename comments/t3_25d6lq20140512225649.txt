"Soon the engagement announcements will end, then there will be nothing but baby photos. Baby photos everywhere."

THIS.  

Oh god, it's like clockwork.  OP said that they're going to 9 weddings in the next 6 months... I guarantee that over the next 18 months there is going to be nothing but ultrasound pics and "we're having a baby!" announcements.  My facebook wall is nothing but toddlers and marathon times!

I'm happy for my friends, I really am... but sometimes they're combined baby-ness is too much.
