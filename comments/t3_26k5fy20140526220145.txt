There are plenty of women like the woman who wrote this article. Shock journalism or whatever you want to call it is profitable and a way some people make a living. Take the rather well known Ann Coulter for example (I apologize for bringing a political pundit into this). She says crazy things, has written several books and had several interviews that are often filled with hate and misinformation. The Shocking statements they make tug at our emotions, provoke responses, and create buzz about what they say. Unfortunately that also brings them publicity (or notoriety if you will), enabling them to earn a living, to create more vitriol and continue the cycle. 

Example from Ann Coulter:

"If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women. It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care -- and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?'" Said by Ann Coulter 10/2/2007
