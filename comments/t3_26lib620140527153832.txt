Of course it's relevant! My point kinda was that abuse can come from anyone, anywhere. Even your best friend, or someone you look up to. It feels like, if it wasn't physically violent, then it's no big deal. I think the genders also come into play, unfortunately. If Tina had come in the form of a boy, I think I'd have had a lot easier time being taken seriously. I don't like to think that it's true at all, but it likely is. 

I think I'll always feel guilt. They were my actions. If I can blame Tina for what happened to me, why couldn't my friend blame me for whatever I did to her?

But anyway, thank you for commenting and telling me your story. I hope you receive closure if you haven't already. *hugs*
