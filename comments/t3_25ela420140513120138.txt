The AMA recommends breastfeeding through the second year. The average age of weening worldwide is 4 years old. Nursing my kids through their second year made their second year (often called 'the terrible twos') extremely peaceful and calm. It was (is) a natural extension of attachment parenting, which I practice with my children. Breastmilk saw my special-needs toddler through noro-virus, keeping her hydrated and out of the hospital. I believe it helped my children be happier, healthier and more secure. Extended breastfeeding is good for both mom and child. Of course do whatever you want, but there are very definite and wonderful benefits to nursing through the toddler years.
