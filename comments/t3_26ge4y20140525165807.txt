'but I don't think it's fair to continue this when I don't see a future'

That comment is all the reason you need. The fact that you still care about his feelings in all of this means you're not an asshole in the slightest. He will hurt, and it'll hurt you, but it's not fair to either one of you to continue a relationship if it's not going to go anywhere.

I went through this almost 3 years ago now when I split with my ex of 9   years. We started dating in high school and he was all I knew as far as relationships, but in the last year it just wasn't there anymore.

Fact is, you have to take care of yourself. If you're already feeling resentful of the relationship it's time to let him go. You can tell him the reasons why, but you don't owe him answers if he starts pushing for them. Lean on your family and friends for support if you can (my younger sister was amazing for this), and don't be afraid to be selfish when it comes to your own happiness and wellbeing.
