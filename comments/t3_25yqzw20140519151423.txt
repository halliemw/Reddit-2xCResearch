I'll add my voice in. Try online dating. Have an honest full-length pic. I like OKcupid.

You'll get trolled occasionally (all women do) don't get discouraged, and stick to your guns (have a few hard and fast standards). You'll likely go on a few awful dates, but you'll learn a lot and eventually you might find a keeper. One last thing: don't think that you owe a man anything for taking you out on a date.
