I was just thinking back to experiences I have had with people who have extreme views, I never saw much productivity in them becoming aggressive and instead tried to keep things calm. I did also say to make sure it's known that you disagree with them as well though, you can be nice and still argue, I don't think that is being subservient as much as it is just being mature and realising these people would really love to piss you off and make you show how "crazy" you must be if you start not being nice to them and getting hostile towards them.
