Take a deep breath, close your eyes.

Imagine yourself as a 12 year old in that exact situation. Think of how you'd feel and react.

Now think of everything that has happened in between now and then. You're not the same person, you can't discount years of experience.

Go take a look at yourself now. This is who you are. This is the only person that has always been there at every single moment. 

And those girls will never understand that or what you've been through. No one can, really.

So hold your head up high, puff your chest out, and trust yourself. 12-year-old you in that situation would probably wish she was the current you instead. And she was - she is.
