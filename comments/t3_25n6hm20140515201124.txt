The same seem to work for me also.  Instead of cursing, I have perfected the art of the teacher voice.  The one that has authority and can shame all but the most hardened cat-callers.

Anything not vulgar is usually met with precise politeness which, oddly, seems to prompt politeness in return.

Anything over-the-top gross is met with a "Why would you say that?"  I've yet to see a guy not start stumbling over his words as he tries to explain *why* he just said what he did.

Construction workers who seem to be "good natured-ly" cat-calling (if that can even be a thing) get a "You kiss your mother with that mouth?"  That's always prompts ribbing from his mates.

Anything that makes me feel genuinely unsafe (vs. annoyed) and I walk into the nearest business.
