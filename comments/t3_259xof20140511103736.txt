Do you live in a house or an apartment? My apartments throw community events and I've met a neighbor or two and befriended them. As people have suggested, meetup.com. 

Look to see if there's a Reddit group for your city. Most of my current group of friends (not my best friends, but the people I hang around with most often) are from my city's subreddit (we actually have a very active Facebook group).

Do you have a dog? See if there's a pet park nearby. I've noticed people really seem to bond with other regulars at my local pet park.
