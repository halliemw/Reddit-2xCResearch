I will say that there's nothing wrong with not going to college as long as he's doing something to get training and to prep for life. That could be community or junior college or vocational school or training for welding, pipe fitting, machining, heavy equipment operating, truck driving, etc. Some people just aren't intelligent enough for college or don't enjoy school, and that's oaks as long as they do something to go beyond minimum wage.
