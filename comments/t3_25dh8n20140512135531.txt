I always thought men must have their own cycles but never researched it :)
Makes so much sense when you explain it in terms of hunger and worry and not thinking straight as those would rightly change the way you feel. 

And also true that you say you can control your behaviors and it not giving you an excuse to treat people badly, it doesn't. But do you ever feel sometimes when you have these emotions, and you know in your mind that the way you are feeling is slightly over the top... but you still cant stop feeling like that? it really shows the strength of our bodies and how confusing they can be!
