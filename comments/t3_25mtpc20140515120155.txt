They have beds, booths (standing UV tan), as well as Mystic Tan. I've done beds and booth in the past but my preference is the booth (standing, less surface area for germs). I'm in the northeast, so there is precious little time to tan naturally. And for whatever reason, my skin does not want to ever change colors from the pale yellow of it's natural state. I don't burn, but I literally need to be outside for days straight in pure sun to get a shade healthier looking. Which is why UV tanning once in a while works for me in the summer.
