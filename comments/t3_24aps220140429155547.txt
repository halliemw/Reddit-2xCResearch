On one hand, I could see this written from the standpoint of a woman who's tired of hearing her friends complain about their relationships. She writes the article, and then gets abused by the good folks here at TwoX because of what seems to be an incredibly condescending way she talks about how her friends could be happy.

On the other hand, men aren't always about sex and laziness, and women aren't sex machines-slash-doormats. Y'know, thinking on it, with the exception of 1, 2, 3, and 13, this could be for pretty much anyone. I mean, barring the examples, the little rules she has sound pretty good. Maybe flip the gender nouns here and there, *et voila*, it's for your guy friend.
