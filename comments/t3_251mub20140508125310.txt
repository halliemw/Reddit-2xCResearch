There's an enormous difference between wearing a scarf over your hair and a proper hijab.  Anyway, the more controversial forms of dress tend to be the [niqab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niqab) and [burqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa), which cover nearly the entire face and body respectively.  These garments undeniably serve to hide women, unlike the hijab.
