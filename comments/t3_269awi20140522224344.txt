I just want to give you advice my therapist gave me regarding the gyno.  You do not need to consent to a physical exam if you don't want to.  I suggest going to the gyno and talking with the doctor and being as open as you can about your experiences and see how comfortable you feel.  If you do not want the doctor to touch you and give you an exam then you can tell them that you don't feel comfortable and you want to leave.  Just meeting with the doctor would be a good first step and if you do happen to feel comfortable that's even better.
