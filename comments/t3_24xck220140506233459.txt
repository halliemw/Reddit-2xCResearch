I agree. 


I think that if we can offer other people on the sub the idea that "you could get an abortion" when they're talking about unwanted pregnancy, we should also be able to offer the idea "you could choose to put it up for adoption, or keep the baby yourself" without being not only downvoted (in the scheme of things, that's not important) but shouted down.
