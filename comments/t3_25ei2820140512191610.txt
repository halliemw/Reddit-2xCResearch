So the ads with statistics and numbers in them, do not appeal to women's emotions in particular? Why group the entire gender together and say we don't like ads with statistics in them? Is it true we all would prefer storytelling and anecdotes? You really don't see this as the advertisers saying the numbers go over our gender's heads? Surely there are men who prefer storytelling over statistics, why are they not being targeted?

This just raises uneasy questions with me.

And just because Dems do it too doesn't make it right.
