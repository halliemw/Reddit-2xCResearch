Going to copy and paste what my friend posted on this topic yesterday over at /r/FemmeThoughtsFeminism

> > “It may be that negative depictions of women reawaken negative stereotypes that some men hold about women, whereas positive depictions challenge those stereotypes.” 
> 
> It all really comes down to this quote right here. People are quite susceptible to persuasion while watching TV. Show depicts character you like, character acts in a way you like, therefor that kind of person becomes a positive in your mind.
> 
> It'll come down to writing as well. In Whedon shows like Buffy or Angel, the characters aren't just dealing with a new "monster of the week", they have their regular lives they are dealing with as well. This gives them a stronger than average appearance. "Here's someone dealing with all the everyday crap that I deal with, AND managing to fight of a horde of vampires!"
> 
> > He adds that fictional media like movies and TV might actually have a bigger effect than “an educational message being blatantly rammed down viewers’ throats.”
> 
> Here's another good point. If something is entertaining it is, by definition, something you enjoy. You're much more likely to remember and take to heart a message you enjoy than you are a message that just seems preachy and forced.
> 
> We're starting to see more and more positive depictions of strong female characters in movies, TV, literature, and even comic books (though mostly just Marvel... DC still has a ways to go). It used to be the strong female characters were the baddies, which made an association of "strong women = not good". The older Bond films are a excellent example of this.
> 
> Marvel has been doing a great job on this front in their movies. In the first Iron Man, it can be argued that Pepper is the hero of the day at the end. Sure Tony fought Obadiah, but it was Pepper that brought in SHIELD to arrest him and it was Pepper that essentially landed the final blow, taking out Obadiah, saving Tony's life. They repeated this in Iron Man 3.

> And those are just examples from one of their franchises. Spread across the others you have Liv Tyler's Betty Ross, Scarlett Johannsen's Black Widow, Colby Smulders' Agent Maria Hill, Natalie Portman's Jane Foster, Jaimie Alexander's Lady Sif, Haley Atwell's Agent Carter. Even the Agents of SHIELD TV show has introduced more than a few strong female characters, three of them as part of the main cast.

> Thirty minutes into typing this, I feel this turned into a rant that is almost off subject.... oops. Well I guess the point I was trying to make is that the kind of effect that Psychologist Christopher Ferguson has documented in his study is going to become more and more prevalent in the years to come.
