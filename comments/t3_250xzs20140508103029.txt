>Everyone always comments on how sweet he is

This is incredibly common. He will keep up appearances while working to socially isolate you and escalate the abuse. Please, please, please - get out now and never look back. 

>My mother told him to try to get me back

And I want to smack your mom. This incident between you and your **ex** is not some test of your love, where he fucks up and then works tirelessly to win you back and your relationship is stronger in the end. 

What you did was really difficult, but you're strong, and you made the right decision :)
