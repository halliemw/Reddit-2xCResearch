The movement is targeted to issues that disproportionally effect men. I can't believe how many people believe there aren't issues that directly effect men and that we want to collect, discuss and advance solutions them. The biggest one for me is the practice of genital mutilation, and how I came to follow the MRM. Should we not be able to collect and talk about GM for fear of extremists and misogynists co-opting us? Of course not. 

What you are talking about is not accepted behavior to anyone worth listening to in the MRM. You're looking for what you expect, and not seeing the legions of upstanding moral men that aren't part of the oligarchy and received no check in the mail from it. We want to be able to discuss our own gender issues without fear of being lumped into these maniacs. But no, we get people like you that spout rhetoric at the expense of free speech and free inquiry and would rather hurl insults at the many for the actions of the few. Not stopping to think for a second that maybe everything isn't all perfect with having a penis and there might be good men that just want to talk about it.
