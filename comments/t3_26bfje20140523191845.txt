Not too personal at all! I have had hip issues for almost 9 years now, and it finally progressed to the point where it was severely interfering with my daily life. I had a cortisone injection to help with pain and inflammation, but it actually wore away at my tendons and ligaments in the joint. So, I was stuck in bed waiting for insurance to approve surgery and waiting for the surgery itself. I had my IT band lengthened and all the tears repaired in March, so I am on the upswing of recovery. We will find out in the next few months if more surgeries are needed (fingers crossed it's a no!).    
    
Sorry to hear you're in bed, too. I never realized before how depressing it can be! I hope you're healing well and taking care of yourself. PM me if you ever need to chat! =)
