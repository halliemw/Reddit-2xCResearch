I agree there. Though it's a shame to have been shown this subreddit while it's in such...turmoil, I'm really glad it's been shown to me! I have very few subreddit's I've subscribed to, and this one seems like it has the potential to fill a hole in my interests I didn't realize was there. Once it stabilizes again, at least.
