I'm not fat but it really bugs me when a lot of TV shows and movies have super attractive women with ugly men. I understand that it helps ugly men identify with the situation, but there isn't anything for women who don't fit society's standards of beauty to identify with. I don't see how men supposedly being more sex-driven than women is an excuse. There should be TV shows about women who don't fit society's standards of beauty because, statistically speaking, women are more likely to be self-conscious about their looks and it would be great for these women to have a character they can identify with.
