There is such a thing as an emotional affair. I tried to make my most recent relationship work for almost a year after my ex had a similarly brief one, but the trust refused to come back no matter how much I begged it of myself. 

Ask yourself whether it's a symptom of his emotional needs, or maybe a difference of maturity, or perhaps even a sign of boredom. Ask yourself how you really feel about it; listen to your gut.
