To me, it sounds like Natalie's knowledge of "normal male behavior" is founded on the stereotype of male hypersexuality. That's just my perception based off of what she said, and what I can relate to having similarly heard. 

I can't really speak for Natalie, but at her age, I had similar experiences with older guys (though the largest gap for me was five years). Mostly, teenagers are naive and curious, that's the short part of why she might have put herself in that situation. She could have thought it was thrilling to experience "adult" life, and she could have genuinely been curious about sexuality. As a young teenager, you often don't have enough resources or enough encouragement to realize/understand when power dynamics in sexual exploration are problematically uneven, and so I think a lot of teens just go ahead with the experience, because they're truly curious and they don't know to expect different circumstances.
