not really. kegels help tone the muscles around your pelvic floor in general, and also help YOU learn to control them better. 

personally, I dont do kegels. I have a pelvic floor dysfunction where my pelvic floor muscles are abnormally tight and occasionally spasm, twitch, cramp, etc. this is in no way caused by kegels or anything, but kegels (and generally tightening my pelvic floor muscles on purpose) definitely exacerbate it and make it bother me more frequently.

I would guess that anyone who had damage "caused" by kegels actually had another pelvic floor issue that was just worsened by kegels.
