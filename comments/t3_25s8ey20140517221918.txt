Yeah, that doesn't seem too relevant to short term pain. When I have a kidney infection, I'm vomiting from pain, but I'm not really adapting my lifestyle unless you count "taking antibiotics and napping like for any normal infection," and when I do something dumb like run in unsupportive shoes and make my knees hurt at around a 4 or 5 on that scale, I change my lifestyle for a week or more while they recover a little. The kidney pain is so much worse but would rank lower on that scale because it focuses on its effect on daily life, which has basically stopped when I'm sick.
