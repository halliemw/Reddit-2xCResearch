I got a few full of slurs/the usual "kill yourself" crap, and one detailing how the person wanted to rape me, so that was.. fun. 

It's not anything new to me in my vast internet experience, but it's completely awful and disgusting. I don't blame people for leaving. If I didn't have such a good handle on my triggers, it could've set me off. It makes me worried about the people here who it could set off.
