It sounds to me like you are obsessing about the negatives: the nausea, the time sap, and even your last baby's birth.  

Sometimes I think our subconscious throws up these walls to protect us.  Maybe you're afraid to let yourself enjoy this pregnancy (nausea, crying jags, and all) because you're afraid to lose it.  Maybe there's something else in your life that feels unsettled.  And yeah, maybe you're a hormonal mess.  I mean, you did just get pregnant!

It sounds like you're taking the strides to get some help from those around you, so that's good.  That's great!  You haven't lost your mind and all control over your life like you fear.  In the meantime, take a deep breath and stop berating yourself for every emotion you're experiencing.  Give yourself permission to be a bit of a hormonal beast, or worried, or whatever it is.  You're going to be okay.
