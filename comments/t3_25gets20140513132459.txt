I agree that it's not inherently masculine or anything. I personally just think having it is an adult thing, not feminine or masculine or anything like that. I also think the idea of hairlessness being feminine isn't good for anyone. I know my grandpa got teased mercilessly in the Navy because his legs don't really grow hair and apparently that was "girly". It's just hair, and it's ok to have it or not.
