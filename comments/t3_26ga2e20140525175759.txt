> Why are you taking this so seriously? These are the rationalizations of a disturbed kid to deal with rejection 

Because there's actually **a lot** of men who have these rationalizations where they think they are entitled to a person by virtue of being male. If I had a dollar for every time I've (or a friend) felt unsafe around one of these "charming" and handsome individuals.

I'm talking instances where a guy insists my friend go home with him because he paid for french fries when my friend explicitly told him "no I don't want anything from you and I don't even know you."

Guys who demand on the street that my friends give them their phone numbers to call them up some time. No. No. No. No. Just because you think a girl is pretty and you comment on how attracted you are to her and want to buy her shit in the hopes of getting laid doesn't mean you deserve to be with her.
