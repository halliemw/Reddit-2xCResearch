I just want to say that I appreciate how quickly you picked up on the idea of listening and being compassionate rather than simply trying to offer up solutions (that have probably already been attempted). Lots of times women just want to vent, and men attempt to find solutions instead of listen. I have this problem with my boyfriend ALL the time. If you learn early in life to just listen, you will save yourself a ton of annoyed ladies. :)
