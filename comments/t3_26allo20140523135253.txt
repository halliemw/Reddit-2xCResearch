Damp washcloth that's soaped up, roll it around in there, then wipe with a clean one wet one. You may have to repeat a few times. And sit them in sunshine afterwards for ten-fifteen minutes or so, helps kill bacteria. Roll up a dry cloth and stuff it in to dry it, and/or a silica pouch(be careful not to leave a silica pouch in leather for more than a couple of hours) you may need to use a leather oil if the leather seems dry. Thorough cleaning should only need to happen once every  few months, and cycle your shoes day to day when you can. Baking soda should be sufficient as a deodorizer.
