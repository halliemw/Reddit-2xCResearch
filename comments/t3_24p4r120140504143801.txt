I've started telling them no a bit more, mainly with my children. My oldest daughter is diabetic and they insist on taking her to McDonalds and  IHOP all the time, like 3+ times a week. My father would get full kids meals "as a snack" for them, then they would come home and eat dinner. 

It's slowly sinking into them that this is not healthy for her. I wish I didn't need to rely on them to pick the girls up from school so much.
