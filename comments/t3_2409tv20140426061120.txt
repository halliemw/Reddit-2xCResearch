A few years ago my husband and I took in his 14yo sister. Their mother had passed a few years before and their dad was never very involved until the mother passed. His wife has mental issues and pretty much refused to let E (husbands sister) live there any longer after she got into some trouble. So she had a lot of emotional issues. We didnt have the space or finances, and also had an infant. It was hell, but I would do it again. It saved her from going to juvey, which was the only good thing. 

Question though - what does your sister want? At 14 they need to feel like they have some say in it. Their emotions are all over the place. She needs to know you are willing to do it because you love her, but that there is effort needed on her part to make it work. We did not have the right tools to deal with E's problems and it made so many things so much worse. My suggestion is to speak with a family counselor before a decision is made to see they can help you come to a decision about this, and so you have the tools to make it successful if it happens. Ours was an emergency situation and we had no adjustment or preparation period. There are a million things I would have changed. But I would do it again.
