I'm not flexible, fast or healthy - I drew a short stick on the genetic lottery and have lung conditions that would make me drop dead if I tried to run 50 miles. If you or someone you know is athletic, fast, flexible, and whatnot, good for you. Not everyone else is. Besides, I'd just like to be strong, not fast etc etc.
