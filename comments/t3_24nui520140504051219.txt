If the man friend is someone you're seeing, it is understandable that he got upset. Think about it in the reverse, how would you feel  if he stripped off in front of a girl and you found out about it later?
If the man friend is not someone you're seeing, why is it any of his fucking business?
If you have no issue with nudity (and there isnt a partner issue) then there is no issue with being naked around others, providing they are ok with it (you should have checked first).
