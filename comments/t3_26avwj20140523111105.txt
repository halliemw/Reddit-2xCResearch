I also have a lot of questions about my HPV. My gyno hasn't really been able to explain it to me very much, besides telling me it is something I have to monitor, I CANNOT miss my regular paps. I have had to go in for regular colposcopys (which are like extreme paps with a biopsy). My understanding is that it is a condition a lot of young women have, and it is something you have to keep a careful eye on, because it can turn into cancer. 

I was confused as to why I got it, because I got that HPV vaccine when I was a teenager. I have a lot of questions, just like you, but my gyno has never been able to answer them. I should make an appointment at Planned Parenthood like you did, and ask them my questions. 

I know it's terrible news to hear. It feels devastating. It gets better, though, when you go in for your regular appointments. Make sure you get it looked at often. It is not the end of the world, and it is something you can live with. *hugs*
