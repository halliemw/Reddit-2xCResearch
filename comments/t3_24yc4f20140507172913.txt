Honestly, it was disturbing to me because she lauded being able to create a life and saved the sonogram, which seems like something that, say, a mother who gave her child up for adoption might say. But then she is happy that this life, as she named it, was terminated. It was upsetting to me how offhand she was about the whole thing.

I understand that some people might not feel that way, but it feels too casual to me. Like she was glad she went through the pregnancy, if only to end it. This is probably my hormones talking, as I am trying to get pregnant right now. The mentality makes little sense to me. 

To me, it was as if she was onscreen hugging and petting a pig and then slaughtered it while laughing and posted a video about how happy she is about doing it. That's the level of uncomfortability I feel here.
