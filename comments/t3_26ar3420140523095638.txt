>his response was, "Absolutely not."

my response would be to kill him with laughter, before explaining that (as you said) I am not ASKING him for permission, I am telling him what I'm planning to do.

I work in managerial position in finance (London, UK) - I have many usually visible tattoos and facial piercings. I take the piercings out for the interviews and cover the tattoos (arms, back, collarbone/decolletage). Then, after I am established enough in the new job, I just start wearing my piercings/showing the tattoos (depending on the weather/time of year). 

Most of the people in the offices I worked at have tattoos as well, and I have never been asked to cover them or take the piercings out. (apart from one abusive HR manager who got fired in the end anyway)


for me - it was worth it. You need to think about the profession you want to find work in and the area you live in for perspective (this is why I gave my parameters). Big city will be much more tolerant than a small town, etc etc.
