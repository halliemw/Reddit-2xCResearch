The part about how girls are raised to believe there is established equality hit home for me. When I was very young, I didn't notice anything strange about being a girl. My parents weren't too concerned about me doing "girly things", so I played with Legos and Barbies and stuffies and Pokemon figures and felt like a pretty average kid. In high school I went to an all-girls school where the prevailing notion among the students was "we don't need feminism", but that's because "women in leadership" and "women in science" was pushed at us so aggressively without actually telling us about any gender imbalance (maybe they wanted us to keep our optimism). Graduating from high school, experiencing street harassment while living on my own, plus exposure from the internet is what gradually disillusioned me and made me realize how silly we were in high school and how every woman should really be a feminist.
