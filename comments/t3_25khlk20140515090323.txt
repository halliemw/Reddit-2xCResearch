I have noticed this in reverse.  In fact, if it is something I know something about, they tend to be almost disbelieving of any advice or information I give.  It seems like men practically *always* have to confirm what I say with another man before they'll really give it credence.  

Also, mansplaining...holy crap is it the most annoying thing ever.  Although, the first time I realized I was being mansplained to, I actually started laughing right in the middle of the conversation.  It was so annoying, but at the same time to finally have that word, "mansplain" suddenly and so plainly illustrated before me just struck my funny bone.  I think the guy was a bit put-off that I was laughing at him.  I *work in IT*, have for 5 years now...and he was trying to tell me some BS about what a motherboard is for that was *completely wrong*.  But he wouldn't listen to me, in spite of the fact that I work in the field as a system administrator.  =P
