I have a friend who at age 19 convinced himself he was in love with a 12 year old. He had access and spent time with her. He began an emotional relationship with her. He convinced himself it was love, so that he could believe it was OK. He manipulated her into a sexual situation. Her parents found out. He went to prison. I do not believe he would repeat any of this. He has not done so to my knowledge. He has candidly explained his view of what he did and accepted responsibility for making a very stupid series of choices at age 19 that harmed a young girl perhaps forever. Everyone in the area knows who he is and what he did. He is in his 40s and did serve time for the crime, register as a sex offender, and gets shitty jobs and has a meager existence- and knows it is all his own fault. Still, I was wary of being his friend and I do wrestle with it. I never want to be an apologist or minimize what he did. I don't think he does either, as we have had some very frank discussions over the years. But I look at my own currently 19 year old son, and I know that he's a better man than my friend. He knows that 12 year olds are ineligible for dating. He'd kick the  ass of any adult messing with his young sisters.
