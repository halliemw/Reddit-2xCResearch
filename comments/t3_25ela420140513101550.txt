In the US, it's pretty uncommon to ever see a mother breastfeed. I've only seen moms breastfeeding at moms' clubs & playdates and toddler classes... basically, places where the only adults around are mothers with little kids. 

I breast fed both of my children, one until 16 months old and one until 12 months old. The only times I ever fed them in public were when there weren't many options: at an airport, on airplanes, and at a park. I just was too nervous to breastfeed anywhere like a restaurant because I knew I'd be the very first breastfeeding mother many people have ever seen in real life. How weird is that? It's a lot of pressure, and I was scared I'd be shamed for it. We don't really go out to eat, so it wasn't a big inconvenience for us... but I definitely understood why most American mothers give up on breastfeeding after a couple of months.
