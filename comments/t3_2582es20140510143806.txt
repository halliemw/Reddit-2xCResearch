Unfortunately my appointment isn't until Wednesday :/

As far as urgent care/ER goes I have to get it approved by a nurses line for my insurance to cover any of it and I was told to just wait until my provider can see me since weird changes are normal when switching birth control. I'm considering trying again if it stays this bad all weekend.
