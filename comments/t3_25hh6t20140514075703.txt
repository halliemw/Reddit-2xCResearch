>  Some of the "how should I feel" sort of posts quickly escalate into making a woman feel like she was seriously violated or abused when in reality, if she didn't feel like that before all people are doing is unnecessarily traumatizing that person.

This is exactly why I unsubscribed a year ago. It's like doctors who all prescribe the same medication without really examining the problem - two women can be sexually assaulted and feel completely different about what happened, but it seems like it's the norm to say, "No you SHOULD be upset, you SHOULD feel violated, you SHOULD be furious."
