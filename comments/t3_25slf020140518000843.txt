Ah! This happens to me all the time. I was an associate manager at a movie theater and I was frequently throwing around large bags of popcorn seed and 24 packs of water. I could also lift the tallest ladder and I frequently had to move carts full of stuff. There were SO many instances of a WOMAN stopping and telling me I shouldn't be doing that, or "why isn't a boy doing that?". It still happens to me today as a shift supervisor at a retail store where I'm doing similar lifting tasks. I've helped other woman carry heavy things to their car and they feel weirded out about it. "Is there a man working?" "No, just me." Do you need help or not?! Boggles my mind.
