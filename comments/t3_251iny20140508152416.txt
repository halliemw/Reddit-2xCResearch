Seriously this. OP, you've made it clear you have had issues with this kind of behaviour in men in the past. When he did this he was NOT respecting you or your feelings. This has nothing to do with him being "inexperienced" in relationships. I'm not sure why a second chance is even being given.

I wish you the best of luck in trying to forgive and forget, if that is what you choose to do. But if you cannot ABSOLUTELY move on and trust him unconditionally, then recognize that and leave.
