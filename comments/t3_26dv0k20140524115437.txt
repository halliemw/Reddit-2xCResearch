Women sometimes feel confident based on looks because society has taught us for centuries that that is all we are.  This is something women go through everyday, so it is absolutely relevant to women's perspective.  I totally agree that it is a social evil, and that we must educate ourselves that our worth and sense of worth shouldn't be based on looks.  But at the same time, it is unfair to ban posts about it.  As for the photos, we only have one day for them, I don't think this should change.  It was bad enough to make the sub default without our input, it isn't fair to add insult to the injury and curb our discourse to force a point of view that some people see as more adequate.  Most importantly, it isn't fair to do that because our audience has changed.  Just my 2 cents.
