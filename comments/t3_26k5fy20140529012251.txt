Well, that's a hard question to answer. I certainly don't prefer it. And I don't think that physicians are able to have peak empathy at that kind of hours. At the same time, if I don't work, there really isn't anyone else to pick up the slack. When one of the other rads got sick last week, I just worked longer. He was in the hospital, what was he going to do?  


Where I do disagree however is in the residency. Even with the reforms many go over the 80 hour work week. I will admit I did ( though never reported it ) And it isn't even 80 hours a week, its an  average more than 80 hours a week over a four week period. 

But I do believe that residency was very important, and it would be really hard to achieve the level of mastery that one needs to practice with out the long hours every week. Looking back, I wish I spent more time working in residency, to be honest.
