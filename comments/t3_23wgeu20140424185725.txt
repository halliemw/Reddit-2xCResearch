Yuck. A guy told me this after he had seen me have a seizure. It was the single creepiest thing anyone has ever said to me in me in my life. I get grossed out chills just thinking about how he thought this was somehow a sane and acceptable (and *charming*!) viewpoint. I would have felt slightly better if it was just some bullshit PickUp Artist 'neg'... but this felt like he was really telling me about himself and his worldview, and it was fucking CHILLING. Good luck (and consider getting far away from him.)
