I had a lot of issues with my mirena.  It took me several days before I stopped cramping, and then I wasn't able to do intense exercise without more cramps and bleeding.  Supposedly everything was in place, it just 'disturbed' the lining of my uterus. Anywhoo, this is supposedly semi-common in women who are nulliparous.  (Not sure if you have had children yet.)
