I'm not the commenter you replied to, but I'll share my thoughts on the matter.

I think anyone who bases their sense of self-worth on the opinions of others is going to be disappointed eventually. While anybody can do pretty much whatever they want with their body (obviously there are legal and practical limits to this, but you get the idea), *why* they are doing it is more important. 

It isn't that your self-worth doesn't matter, it is that someone who prefers no body hair is not obligated to find you attractive. Nobody is obligated to find anyone attractive. *If*, and only if, you base your sense of self-worth on how attractive others find you, you will have a bad time no matter how much hair you have, or where it is.

As is apparent by your post, there aren't as many people who like/want body hair. I'm all for self-acceptance, and I hope that's what your going for here. But you cannot force other people to accept you. I hope people do, and I understand that society dictates what is "attractive" as much as biology. 

Looking at it from another perspective, I have a mood disorder and a substance abuse problem. Some people wouldn't want to have a relationship with someone like me, and that's fine. Some people wouldn't want to have a relationship with someone like you, and that's also fine. If either of us base our worth as humans on who/how many people want to sex us up, we'll probably get some very low self-esteem.
