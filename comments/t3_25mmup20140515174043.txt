The university however has the freedom to use a lower bar of evidence. The proof standard for criminal law is "beyond a reasonable doubt." The colleges are free to use a lower standard, such a "preponderance of evidence." 

With beyond a reasonable doubt, if there is even a slight chance that the accused is innocent, you are supposed to set them free. Here the idea is it's better for ten guilty people to go free than one innocent person punished. This heavy standard is imposed because the penalties are so harsh, such as imprisonment, loss of the vote, felony records, or even death penalty for murderers.

Preponderance of evidence is applied to lesser things. For example in civil cases, both sides simply argue, present evidence, and the side that has the greater amount of evidence wins. This is why, say in the OJ Simpson case, he got off of the murder charge, but was found at fault in the wrongful death suit. The juries found a preponderance of evidence, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.

A college court is more like a civil case. The worst thing that happens is that you're thrown out of school. They don't have the ability to imprison people. If you get thrown out of school, you can go get a job somewhere, you can go enroll in another school, start a business, join the army, or do a thousand other things with your life. 

The burden of proof is higher for criminal cases because the penalties are so much harsher.
