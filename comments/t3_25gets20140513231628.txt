I think that when your hands and a cock get wet, and there is a lot of up and down action, hairs just stick to the wetness, or your hand touches another part of the body and then they stick, or they are near the bottom of the shaft and the up and down motion makes the hairs travel up....anyway, this is how I think hairs get in one's mouth when doing oral on women too, not directly from the mouth actually licking hairs. 

I only gave a woman oral once , but I was down there for a long time, she had a full bush, and there were no hair in the mouth issues at all. I think guys just shed a lot more and so one is more likely to get hairs in the mouth when going down on a guy....but our bodies vary, and like said, I don't have a lot of experience licking pussy. I just have never heard of it as an issue from a lover, and I have hardly ever shaved or trimmed.
