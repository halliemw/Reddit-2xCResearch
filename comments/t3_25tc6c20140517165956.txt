Honestly, I think you should try to get a lawyer.  Universities tend to aim for resolutions that shut things down quickly, and avoid bad press for the university.  By retaining your own lawyer, you have someone who is on YOUR side, not on the university's.  Consult with a sexual assault hotline- they might have some guidelines on the legality of what the school is trying to do, and have some real legal advocate resources. 

It may also help your case in the future by showing that you are taking this seriously, and are willing to escalate to the courts if you need to.

I'm so sorry this shit went down with you, and I'm so sorry this dude was ever anywhere near you. You are not responsible for anything he chose to do to you or any other woman, and anyone who tells you otherwise is placing the blame in entirely the wrong corner.
