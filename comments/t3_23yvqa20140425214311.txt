[Here](http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm394773.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) is the FDA press release. The majority of the links on the original story are basically self-references going to other articles on the same site.

From the FDA statement:

>Using a sample of cervical cells, the cobas HPV Test detects DNA from 14 high-risk HPV types

I'm reading that as a different lab test, but much the same procedure in the doctor's office. It may reduce the number of unnecessary coloposcopies, but I don't think this is a major change in care or diagnostics.
