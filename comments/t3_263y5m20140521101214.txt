For me, it was the title that had me thinking this might be the most horrible clinic ever- probably the quotations around the word landmark.

I live in the US and there are these mock clinics where women can go in for pregnancy testing and counseling. They even do sonograms in some cases. They are funded by churches and are not in fact women's health clinics at all. They have ironic names like "Pregnancy Choices" -the irony being that they will never recommend abortion as a valid choice and will do all they can to get you not to choose abortion. There was one a block away from my house, and it has recently closed.
