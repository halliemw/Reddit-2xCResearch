First off i'm glad to see you seem to be in better spirits, i'm glad you were able to deduces some sense from my ramblings, as i'm nearing 30 i find myself wanting to "help out" younger souls, but i'm still working on my tact ... and delivery.

My feelings about the age difference have not changed, in the sense that there is only one way to find out, i can not look into either of your minds to see what's at play here tho ;)
Do realise that like your worldview shifted from when you were 11, so is his different from yours.
Personally i would not know what to do with a 19yo girlfriend, not in the sense that i could not feel affection for the right person at a certain age,
Just that the process of growth and discovery you're going through right now, while wonderfull in it's own right, can also weigh on a relationship should either partner not be up to bridging that gap.
Alot in relationships is seeing it from eachothers perspective in order to avoid or understand conflicts, not every 27yo will still know and be understanding of how a 19yo mind works, not every 19yo will have understanding or patience with how a 27yo mind resolved to look at things.

But like i said, case by case basis, just don't take it personally or to hard should it turn out different.

The longing you describe is just a part of human nature, i'm a fairly solitude person but even i would go insane if i could not share what's on my mind with friends/family/loved ones.
You'd be surprised how deerly you can be connected to someone you're friends with, given time you will find or recognise people that are just always there, some of them you will come to hope always will be there, hold on to these people and let them hold on to you.

and if you don't know the song [Sunscreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI), i think it might be a right/good time for you to hear/be reminded of it.
