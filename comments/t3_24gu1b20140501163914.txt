Have you tried practicing swallowing other small pieces of food before? I couldn't swallow pills until a few years ago, I started by swallowing things like sweetcorn (cooked obviously!) with water, then tic tacs, then small pills. If not, I find stick on heat patches really useful, or ibuprofen gel.
