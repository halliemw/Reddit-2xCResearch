I agree. As a young twenty-something walking around alone in a big city, my response is always to just ignore the person. As much as I would love to confront the individual and stand up for myself, it's not worth the risk of retaliation. I have been followed by a car for flipping off the driver. Basically, you never know who's crazy, and I think ignoring the person is the best policy.
