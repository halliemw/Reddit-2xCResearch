I recently started using the OB and I like them. My only complaint is this: is it just me or does there seem to be a learning curve for insertion? Sometimes I have no issues with them staying in place, but other times the tampon seems to have shifted down and starts pushing its way out? I really like the tampons when I get them to stay put, bit when they don't, I find myself wishing I could go back to the ones with applicators.
