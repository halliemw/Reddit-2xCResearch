My Mother-in-law and a cousin don't have pierced ears. My mother-in-law has some [ear cuffs](http://www.martymagic.com/product_images/g/946/Sirens_Song_Silver2__21340_zoom.jpg) that she wears if she wants to dress up her ears.

I think a lot of women have their ears pierced because it was/is popular to get them done when they are really really young.
