If the father donates gametes for IVF, then he certainly would have a genetic tie, but you are talking about "biological" relation, which can be distinguished from "Genetic" ties and even apply to the gestational parent or birth mother due to the sharing of blood, nutrients, placenta, etc. 

Regardless, your point is utterly absurd, and using an example from Star Wars to elucidate on the experience of children who were conceived through egg donation is embarassing. 

I am sure you find this to be a self-gratifying exploration in intellectual masturbation (as if people with a more nuanced understanding of familial makeup and psychological attachment and biological nurturing wouldn't be able to "make sense" of Telemachis or Oedipus. Please), but it is so disconnected from the lived experiences of families, and from the vital and evolving cultural contexts in which they live, that it is, at best, laughable and, at worst, horrifically cruel.
