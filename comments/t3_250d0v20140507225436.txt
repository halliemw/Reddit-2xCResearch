I can definitely relate -- I have [Amelie-esque disaster fantasies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdklJDAzDKk) at the most minor of relationship setbacks. 

I agree that you may have some anxiety issues. I struggle with that as well. I can't really afford therapy, so I found the book "[The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook](http://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1572248912)" to be really helpful. "[My Age of Anxiety](http://www.amazon.com/My-Age-Anxiety-Scott-Stossel-ebook/dp/B00F8F7M58)" is also interesting if you're curious about the science behind it, although it deals mostly with cases that are probably more extreme than what you're experiencing.

If anything, forced positive thinking helps the most. I used to write long journal entries about all of my worries and fears, so of course I dwelled on them all day and night. But this year my New Year's resolution was to write only positive things in my journal, (or to frame even negative events in the context that they're minor setbacks that I can overcome) and my anxiety has already improved hugely.
