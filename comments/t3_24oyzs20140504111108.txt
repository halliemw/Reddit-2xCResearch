I'm also Asian and feminist, so I definitely feel your frustration.

I get crap from people who are supposedly liberal allies about this too. I expressed rather mildly that I find some men creepy when they have Asian obsessions. I was accused of being ridiculous and too PC. I was told "why can't they just like the way Asian women look and enjoy anime and want to learn Chinese." I struggle to explain that there's nothing wrong with liking Asian looks or enjoying anime, but there's a certain subset of those people who like those things for reasons that creep me out.

It's rough. =( I don't have any solutions, just empathy.
