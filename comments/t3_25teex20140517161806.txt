Definitely spend some time over at /r/pcos. Great group over there.

Here's the thing. I don't mean to sound rude, but it's important that you understand this. Nearly 10% of women have PCOS. It's insanely common. It sucks, but as far as diseases go, it's not really that bad of one. It's not going to destroy your life, **so long as you don't let it.** 

The key is not letting it. So you didn't win the genetic lottery. Not many people do. But laying down and letting your disease get the best of you is not the right answer. Fighting it with every tool at your disposal *is*.  

So it's time to dig in. Look into metformin and keto and inositol and other BCP formulations, and all of the other PCOS remedies that 10% of women are toying with. You are very much not alone in this, and your life is very much still your own.

>I just don't have the time or the money to find a psychologist right now.

I feel for you, but this is a cop out. You're admitting to anxiety and depression about your condition. You're giving up on your own life. Saying you don't have time to get help right now is unreasonable. You had time to post this long-ass thing on reddit, you have time to find a support group at the very least. Or to call your gyno asking about therapists who specialize in this sort of stuff.
