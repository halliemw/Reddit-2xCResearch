> True, but I think the prejudices are already well-known by most people, including OP.

While it is likely the OP will know of the prejudices I speak of I think a significant minority of people will hold them as prejudices. They'll deny they are prejudices and instead assert them as truths.

> I assume you were trying to be helpful or in identifying where the prejudices that lead to invalidation come from, but I don't think OP was looking for help understanding that. I think she was just voicing her frustration and the frustration that many others have but can't often express. Not looking for an explanation or help, but for a place to say, "Yes, this resonates with me and it's hard.

Nothing in my comment assumes the OP doesn't already understand what I've written. As mentioned I think it likely the OP would think my comments uncontroversial (between she and I), although I'd remain open to her contesting any of it.

The thing is I need help understanding these prejudices and one of the ways to do this is to have an attempt at articulating them. Somebody, may, for example, point to other prejudices, a different way of expressing them, contest them, etc. 

In all cases, it is both on topic, about the frustrations at attitudes some hold toward the fat, and goes to a specific point raise by the poster I'm responding to ... which I quoted.
