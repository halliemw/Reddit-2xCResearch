In Canada any medication that a hospital provides you is free, therefore a lot of time medication that has to be administered by a health professional (nurse, doctor, etc...) will have to be be purchased by the patient outside of the hospital. 

For instance I'm on Remicade and I recieve through an IV infusion, it costs about 40 grand a year, the hospital doesn't want to pay that so I have to get it myself and bring it in.
