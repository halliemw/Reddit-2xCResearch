Happy to hear you are seeking others for guidance but I'd highly recommend finding a good counselor (for yourself and then, if recommended, for your marriage) to get things taken care of. Sometimes fighting and suffering abuse is a better option than staying married because you or your family frowns on divorce. No one deserves to be abused and if your husband isn't willing to resolve his issues and work together to make you and the rest of your family stronger, "leaving the bum" is the right thing to do.

Good luck and well done on seeking help from the Church.
