His behaviour was uncalled for and disgraceful. Being gay does not give someone a free pass to be a dick, and anyone who suggests this is a "culture" thing is patronising the hell out of gay people. Your "friend" is an adult, he jumped on another adult whom he knew was in a committed relationship, and he's wrong. You are perfectly justified in not speaking to him again, unless it's to tell him why. Also I hope your boyfriend is okay.
