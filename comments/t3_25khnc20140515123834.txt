Google and Stack Overflow are your friends.

Knowing how to code is not nearly as important as knowing how to search for answers to your questions on the Internet.

Practically anything you need to know about programming you can find out online these days.

Most of the rest of it is just persistence. Never give up when trying to solve a problem! There's always an answer (even if it's a bad one!)
