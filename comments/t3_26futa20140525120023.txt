I think it's pretty clear from the examples I gave, but I guess I should state it more explicitly: they are at risk of hurting themselves. Yes, the vast majority of mentally ill people do not become violent toward other people, but the potential for *self-harm* is huge. 

But the thing is, even if a mentally ill person "only hurts themself," the people around them are still affected: their family, their friends, their colleagues, their dependents. (My psych says that my depression was exacerbated, if not caused, by PTSD I got from growing up with a mentally ill parent.) I think part of the conversation about mental illness needs to center on the fact that it affects everyone, not just the sufferer, and that we all need to face it squarely and try to do something about it together. Another tempting delusion is to believe that since *I* don't have mental illness, someone else's mental illness is not my problem. But mental illness affects everyone. A mentally ill person you know may not be directly dangerous to you, but they can affect you, and it's in your best interest to help.

For me, part of that conversation has to include discussion about how extremist ideologies can exacerbate mental illness and trigger damaging actions.
