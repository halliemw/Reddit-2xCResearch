Wait, I'm confused. I'm not sure if it's the wording or something else. Are you saying that becoming desensitized to something in a book, to the point where you're not even really thinking too much about it happening anymore, will make you think about what you're not thinking about because...the characters in the books aren't thinking about it? Because they're desensitized as well? Like, if I'm not considering something anymore, if I'm done thinking critically about it because it's been shoved in my face a million times before and is regarded as normal by the narrative, what exactly would make me stop and think about it? 

And the fact of the matter is, we already do live in cultures where rape is a huge problem, some of which are completely desensitized to it. Wanting to draw attention to that is fine, but when it just seems to happen because "history had a rape problem," and the narrative has nothing further to say about it, it becomes gratuitous.
