Ahhh that sounds very similar to my situation right now! Coincidentally, his parents are also super religious! Even the temper tantrum about I WANT PIZZA NOW is the same! I have witnessed his sister do similar things on multiple occasions, and it makes my skin crawl. Everyone else in the house seems to be okay with it, and it is so confusing.

Thanks for your story, it cheered me up :) I have been reminded that this is only temporary and soon we will have our own lives.
