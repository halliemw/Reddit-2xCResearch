Uh no.  On all accounts.  

While people focus on completely unsubstantiated biological differences instead of the far larger shared *human characteristics* we will continue to have unequal opportunities for women.   

There are real and tangible problems that can be fixed and yet *every single discussion* has people like you who bring up biological differences regarding abilities and interests.  To dismiss and distract from the actual issues.

Again.  You want to talk about biological differences?  Create a society with equal opportunists.  And then we'll talk.
