I don't see what the problem is. The specific section she was going to be put in has people fully clothed. It's not even relevant that other pictures on the site are in bikinis, those are in different sections. Thats like saying "I'm allowed to be nude at the nude beach, why do you want me to have my clothes on when I'm inside Target?"
