I apologize if this question sounds insensitive. I am not meaning to be, but I am genuinely curious of the perspective from the other side. 

Arent posting pictures like this just enforcing the false stereotype of 'weak' women in the workforce?

Like, "Hey, look at me, I can do anything a man can do!". 
Of course you can, but making an example of it could be misunderstood as "I am not a normal woman, here is a rare example of us doing the same work that men do"

I understand its more about just showing signs of equality, but on the other hand it could be taken as an "exception to the rule", when in reality, there shouldnt be that rule at all. Doesnt just the point of acknowledging that rule, give it more power than it deserves? (the 'rule' being that men should work the tough, hands on, dirty jobs while women shouldnt)

EDIT: its nice to see actual responses rather than blind downvotes that dont bring anything to the table of discussion.
