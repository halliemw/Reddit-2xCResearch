Just squat down in the shower and pull out the excess with a finger. Problem solved :) 

...Just make sure to keep your fingernails trimmed to avoid tearing the tissue up there (it doesn't have a lot of nerve endings, so you can damage it without noticing if you're not gentle).

Plus, bonus! You can take some of the creamy stuff (not the cervical mucus, but your normal "fluids") and use it to refresh your external bacteria: just smear it all around your outside bits. It'll keep you smelling fresh and helps prevent yeast infections! :)
