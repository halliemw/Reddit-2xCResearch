I've only ever gotten *one* creepy PM from this subreddit, and it was ironically from a post much like this one, and I reported it. 

I think it should be removed as a default because I'm tired of the posts like this. I have yet to see all these tons of troll comments, or people getting harassed in here, and I really expected it to be something like the admins confirmed. I never see the trolls, I just see people talking about the trolls.
