OP, you're a fully grown, independent woman. You're not under her roof and have no obligation to your mother to change or discuss your life if she's going to react this way. You learnt early on as a girl that when these lectures happen to just sit, look at your feet and take it. *You don't have to do that anymore*.


You'll never get her to change her beliefs - they're probably too sunken and, in fairness to your mother, probably very applicable to the world she lived in as a young woman. Thank goodness the world has moved on since then. But it's not too late to start setting boundaries. Think about the topics of conversation that are off-limits to her. Your relationship/sex-life, for starters. If she tries to bring it up, say 'I am not going to talk about this with you'. If she persists, you say 'I will hang up the phone/leave this house if you don't stop it'. And follow through. 


There is absolutely no reason for you to sit there, quiet as a mouse, listening to a tirade of criticism. Stand up for yourself - you can do it!
