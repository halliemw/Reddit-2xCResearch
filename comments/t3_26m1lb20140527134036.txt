Too often men who are less informed about the crap women have to put up with develop a rose-colored view of the world in which things aren't that bad and everyone needs to just relax. This leads them to take a more laid back policy towards correcting their fellow men, especially when no women are around to be offended. The problem is that this is precisely when women need you, a good man, to speak up. Otherwise you give the bad ones tacit approval of their mindset. Here is a short list of the things you need to call men out on, even when they're joking:

* Rape jokes. These are never okay, and perpetuate a culture of rape.
* Catcalling. It is not a compliment. It is a randomly hurled barb of unexpected and potentially dangerous attention most women don't want.
* Talking about "crazy ex-girlfriends." More often than not men use the term to dismiss women, rather than diagnosing a real mental illness.
* Using terms like bossy, catty, pushy when women do things men get away with easily.
* Saying things like "I couldn't date a woman who doesn't shave." or "Women shouldn't dye their hair, natural looks better." or "She should smile more." These phrases are all about taking away a woman's right to manage her own body, even if the men don't think of it that way.
* Implying that women get preferential treatment because of their gender. The amount of shit women have to put up with is in no way balanced by a sexist cop occasionally waiving a ticket for a pretty woman.
* Discussing women's looks, pretty much ever. Sometimes it can sound like butchers sizing up a cut of meat. 
* Talking about the "Friendzone". The concept of the "friendzone" is essentially that women don't have a right to choose who they're attracted to.
* Disparaging women for having many sexual partners. It's no business of anyone's how much sex women have, and it has no impact on their value as a person.
* Implying that men have uncontrollable urges. Saying things like "I can't resist" or "I can't be held responsible" are bullshit ways of placing blame on women. 
* Belittling men about being unassertive. There is a lot of cultural emphasis placed on men's sexual dominance. This is bad, and trains men to think they should keep trying if women say no.
* When men get more offended at false rape accusations than rape itself.
* Blue balls. An attempt to place the burden of sexual satisfaction on women, as though they are intentionally causing them harm by not having sex with them.

There are a lot more. Any time something like this happens, be the voice of opposition. Don't let them think that casual sexism is okay, because that's what leads to much worse things.

Walking women to their cars is not what this movement is about. It's about attacking the root of the problem that necessitates women being walked to their cars. It's trying to remove society's rose-colored glasses and actually look at how unfairly women are being treated. It's about teaching men not to be rapists, not teaching women not to be raped.
