I'm sorry it took so long to respond.  Between my sickness from last weeks chemo and Mother's day, it was a pretty crazy few days. 

I really like a lot of your ideas, thank you so much for sharing them.  I did want to reply about a few specifically:

I love the idea of telling them the stories of their birth.  In fact, after reading this, I spent some time yesterday telling my son the story of his birth, and before I knew it, he was in tears hugging me. It meant a hell of a lot. Thank you for that. 

I also really like the idea of prepaying the grief counselor, and the emails.  Do you (or your husband) have any idea of how I can set that up for time release?  I really like this because I can set it up to do it for a while, but not so long that I end up just reopening a wound that is trying to heal. 

Thank you again for taking the time to write me and to share these ideas.
