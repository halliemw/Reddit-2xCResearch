Way back when my mom (5'1.5", 105 pounds now and 85 pounds at the time) graduated from college and started her teaching career, she was refused jobs because she was so small and they flat out told her they didn't think she could control the bigger boys. Classroom control is **not** about physical intimidation and that would be illegal now, but I know it was a big problem for her. Once she finally got hired and proved herself in the workplace she was fine. She just had a hard time getting started. She's still dwarfed by most of her students, and now my brother and I, too, but at 61 she's obviously older than them and she says she's actually been able to relax a bit more in the classroom in the last 10 years or so.
