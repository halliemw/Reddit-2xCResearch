Hmm. I'd break it down by the two types of posts we see here. 

1. News stories. "I think this about this issue" I don't see how gender matters for an individual comment, although I would be interested in how a block of comments would break down by gender. "I've experienced this because I'm a woman and this is my thought" I think gender becomes self evident in the post.

2. Posts asking for advice/support. If it's good advice, why would the gender matter? If you're looking for advice based on personal experience and it's only a woman thing, probably mostly women will answer. Some guys might answer with second hand experience.
