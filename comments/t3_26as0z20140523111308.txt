I wholeheartedly agree. As the 'husband' in this scenario, I struggle to perform these invisible tasks. As the work becomes 'systematized,' it moves from invisible to visible, making it easier for me to complete. NOTE: NOT all men are like me, and I don't want to pretend that I am the perfect example of the imperfect male.
