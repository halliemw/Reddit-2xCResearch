I can't believe I'm sharing this but I can definitely understand the poop-related-embarrassment! Also, you probably wont get a UTI as long as you had a thorough shower.

When I was about 17 this really cute guy asked me out, and we had hung out prior but I hadn't been to his house yet. So I'm lactose intolerant (He didn't know) and for some stupid reason agreed with his idea to go out for ice cream and back to his house to hangout. I guess I thought I could handle the dairy, nope. 

So back to his *completely gorgeous & huge* house afterwards, and I feel the pressure in my abdomen. I excuse myself and leave the room. I use the bathroom, and turn around to flush. Nothing happens. I spastically and frantically pressing the lever. Still nothing. Crap. Literally. 

So now I'm stuck with this surprising normal looking BM that wont go anywhere. Also, I have to say although I'm not much for caring what people thing but there was absolutely NO freaking way I'm letting this attractive boy see this thing.

I'm freaking out, looking around-trash can? no way. Then I see the window. I'm on the second floor and think this could totally work! I literally scoop this thing up with a hard paper that I find in the bathroom and fling it out the window.

Not only do I fling it out the window facing the front of the house, the god damn thing lands on the front walkway.  Long story short- I never saw him again after this, and yes he saw it. Most awkward moment of my whole life.
