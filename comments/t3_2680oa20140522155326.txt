If you want my advice, I'd say you should perceive yourself for who you are in your mind, rather than your body, because what you can do matters so much more than how you look.  Your talents and abilities will last much longer than your beauty.  It's okay to enjoy being gorgeous, but don't forget to hone your skills as a competent person!

P.S. Guys don't normally hit on girls out of pity.
