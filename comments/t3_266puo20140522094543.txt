Look at the silver lining here, OP. Attending this wedding is clearly becoming more hassle than it's worth and you have the perfect get out clause. 

Say "Bridezilla, I'm sorry but I cannot afford to be part of this wedding. I don't want to spoil your special occasion and so have to bow out of being a bridesmaid".

Do it by phone and don't give her the opportunity to wheedle/guilt you into reconsidering. If you start to feel like you have to justify yourself, make your excuses and hang up the phone.
