Although I have to say, some Korean kids/parents _that I spent a few years growing up with_ thought I was Chinese. I don't think it helped that my dad knows 3-4 Asian languages and is a total nerd about the Chinese language. My Chinese professor one year in college thought I was Chinese until I asked him for help because my knowledge of Korean was getting in the way. Now in SF a bunch of old Chinese ladies on the bus occasionally think I'm Chinese until I open my mouth and speak accented Mandarin (not enough practice :'( ).

Beyond that... I don't know what it is, but people are getting better about recognizing Korean and respecting it. Maybe it's just more cultural exposure (with like Gangnam Style and tasty food).
