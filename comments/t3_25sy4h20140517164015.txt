The one thing that hangs me up over the concept of the Feminine Mystique that it can't really be generalized to all women and shouldn't be. African American women have long since occupied the role of matriarchs in their families and have been viewed in vastly different ways than white women--either as Mammies or Jezebels. Mammies definitely weren't about beauty, but more of a slavery-esque maternity/caretaker role. I like to be mindful of how conceptions of beauty and social roles are not uniform across women, so that more people can feel as if these conversations are applicable to them.
