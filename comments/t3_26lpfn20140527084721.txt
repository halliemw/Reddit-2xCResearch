You are working a lot. You have school, house work and occasional work. For depression, therapy? Yoga also helps lift the mood. Forget about your family. Just take care of yourself. You do do enough work, your depression is about something else. Maybe you can focus on nourishing yourself and making yourself happy. You do not need a justification to exist, like working a lot and making a lot of money. Do not be so hard on yourself. Be kind with yourself. Treat yourself well. Good luck
