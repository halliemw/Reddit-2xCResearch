> It uses progesterone (most pills use estrogen)

Actually, pills are available as combination pills - that is, pills that contain both an estrogen compound and a progesterone - or as progesterone-only pills (POP). There are no estrogen-only pills.

I have a Mirena IUD and absolutely love it.

As far as pros and cons of stopping birth control, a lot of people experience both good and bad side effects. When I stopped taking the pill 9 months before I got my IUD, I was horribly emotional and my libido skyrocketed.
