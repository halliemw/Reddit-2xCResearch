You're not crazy. 

If this happens, try not to see it as a negative. Just because he needs some alone time, doesn't mean he doesn't love you. See it as a chance to have a girl's night with some of your best friends. Go out and see a movie you've wanted to for a while. Do karaoke. Take a class together. Make memories.

If you can afford it, maybe consider seeing a counselor once every week/every other week? And if you can't, try talking to your friends about it. Even if you think you've exhausted them, you probably haven't. If you friends love you, they won't ever feel exhausted by being there for you.
