Honestly, your relationship sounds very much like a sister relationship to me: always fighting & competing, everyone telling you to make up & appreciate each other & not throw the relationship away.

Because she's been in your life for as long as you can remember, I think it's likely she'll be at least a small figure in your life in the future. You'll have mutual friends. You might be invited to the same weddings & events. 

That doesn't mean you have to work at the friendship and try to make it thrive. Sometimes, two people just don't get along very well. I think you should do what you've always done: be civil to her, but leave it at that. In my opinion, you need to work at not being so emotionally invested here. I think we all have friends who are super shitty drivers, especially around high school age. The solution is not to ride with her when she's driving, not seethe in anger about it. You can give her advice once or twice, like, "Hey, I'm worried about you hiking in these remote places yourself," but she's an adult (I think... based on the timeline of your story), and you can't *make* her listen. So, after you speak your peace, let it go. 

By the way, I'd be frustrated with having this young woman in my friendship circle, too. Who wants to have a "friend" gossip about you behind your back? The problem here is that you can't make your other friends ditch her. If she's part of that circle of friends, then you either need to accept her as part of that circle or establish a new group of friends to spend your time with. I don't think it would be fair to say, "I don't like person X, all of our friends are mutual, so I don't want person X to hang out with all of our friends." If you acted that way, you'd be no better than the "friend" who is gossiping about you to others.
