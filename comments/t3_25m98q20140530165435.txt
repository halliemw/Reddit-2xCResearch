I have a noticeable one under one of my arms. I can't use floss or anything to cut off circulation, because to get to it, I need two hands. I'm also a wuss that won't use scissors and a broke college kid that can't afford to get it surgically removed.

Mine isn't in as private of a place, but I still understand.
