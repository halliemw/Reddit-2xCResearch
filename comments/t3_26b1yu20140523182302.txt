Good point. I stand corrected. It's considered stage two obesity, not stage three. However the term obesity is related to a huge increase in mortality rates, along with an increased risk of heart disease etc. 

It isn't a word that's been created by people to shame. It's meant to show that at a certain bmi level your health risks increase.
