Your doctor won't give you an IUD at *21*???

WTF

I'm not much older than you and just got one put in. And I have a friend who had one inserted just after her 18th birthday. It was a total non-issue in both cases.

If it ends badly, it's usually just an easy, simple laparoscopic surgery to remove it. Aforementioned friend had it done recently (started to perforate her uterus) and was awake for the procedure, drove herself home, and had a prescription for opiates of some variety that she really didn't need. They can't put a new one in right away for a surgical removal; gotta wait a few months. In the meantime, any other bc option works.
