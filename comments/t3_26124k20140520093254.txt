Unfortunately I don't track my periods at all. Because of the endo, I was on a hormonal birth control that completely stopped my period for about 5 years. Only 4 or 5 months ago did I start getting a period again. I know nothing about my cycle. My periods last anywhere from 3-4 days to a week. I'm pretty sure I'm a little irregular.
