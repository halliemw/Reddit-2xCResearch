Wow. This really touched me :3 I lost my mother the summer after I graduated high school (about 3 years ago). It was really hard at the time, I obviously shut down to an extent, and no one I knew could really make me feel much better except by distracting me for a bit. It's gotten better, but I know what you mean about it being every day. I think of Mom every day. Even if it's just for a couple of seconds and it's a happy memory or thought, there's still a twinge of pain and sadness that happens. You never fully get over your mother not being there, but time does help a bit. I hope that you have lots of good memories to keep you sort of happy.
