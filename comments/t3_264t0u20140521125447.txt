I totally get it.  You really just need someone to tell you it'll all be OK.  While I haven't been in this situation before, I have been in the "please just tell me it'll all be OK" situation.   I also imagine just writing that out helped, right?  You can't change the outcome now, so don't stress too much.  Just go in there confident in yourself.  Don't let your thoughts get the best of you.
