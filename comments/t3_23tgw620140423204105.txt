I do what I can. I'm ranting a bit here, but I'm very thankful that BVs are relatively benign. I was in the same situation before with a UTI - (un)luckily I was unemployed and I had time in the day to see an urgent care clinic that actually had a sliding scale.

And thanks for doing that for me! I can definitely squeeze that into my budget..
