>it looks like exactly what I need in terms of a female perspective subreddit.

I'd argue this was in part because it wasn't front & center. It was a community that didn't pop up on everyone's radar - you had to look for it.

But more than that it was a community people were invested in maintaing (some no doubt still are). But I am far less invested in the community based on the mods handling of default status. We, (2X as a whole) didn't get to decide about putting ourselves out there. The mods made the decisions, the commenters here seem less than happy about this decisions made on behalf of the community.
