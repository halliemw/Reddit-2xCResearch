Camping is the only time I *don't* wear my diva cup. I'll BRING it just in case but I rarely use it - when there's no running water and I can't clean it effectively.... ehhh. I usually bring tampons and pads in case I need to change them but don't want to stick dirty hands in my vagina. Or I'll get applicator tampons, which I hate but work for that reason. That being said, my camping trips tend to be pretty hiking/labor heavy.

OP, it basically just sucks, I would bring tampons (possibly applicator ones) and a few pads just in case, and maybe a cup too if that's what you usually use. Beyond that - painkillers, and a metal water bottle filled with boiling water works as a heating pad if you're desperate. Oh, and someone else mentioned baby wipes. Brilliant idea.
