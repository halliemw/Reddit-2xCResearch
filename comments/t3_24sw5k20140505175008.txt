As a person in the latter group trying to be more conscious of becoming a person in the former group, I think I agree.  I'm empathizing with OP but also empathizing with the new couple. They probably don't even understand what would be so "wrong" about that. But OP was certainly loved once, and she will take that as she grows into her next relationship.
