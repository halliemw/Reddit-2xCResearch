Also welcome to /r/childfree, where more people have gone through this exact situation: loving the other person very much, but having two different views on what the future should be like. You set him free to chase the life that he wants to lead, and in return you are also free to find the life that *you* want to lead. Hopefully with a very nice man on your side. (In the end, I found mine... ).

Big hugs.
