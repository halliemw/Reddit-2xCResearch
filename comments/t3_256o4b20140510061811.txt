In addition to what /u/olive_heart said, there was an IUD a few decades ago called the Dalkon Shield that had some materials problems. It led to a very increased risk of PID because the string was a great environment for bacteria, and while that's not a problem for modern IUDs, it does make some older doctors hesitant to give them to women who aren't married. There are also increased risks of certain problems in women who haven't had kids, like an increased risk of expulsion. It's not a big enough problem or harmful enough long-term that you shouldn't get one, but combined with historical problems with IUDs, older doctors may not want to insert them in nulliparous women.
