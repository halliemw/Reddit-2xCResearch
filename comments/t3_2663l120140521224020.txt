They don't come to meetings anymore. Not because of D - it's because they've got lives and kids and busy schedules.
On a side note, I desperately wish co-founder K would come back. K has spoken up in the past regarding inappropriate behavior (not from D, from someone else). K has no problem pulling someone aside and telling them to knock it off. I wish M has K's backbone...or any backbone, really. M's "solution" to this problem seems to be, "maybe if we can get more women to join the group, they'd feel more comfortable speaking up when this kind of thing happens." We have a problem with women quitting because of D; getting more to join is going to be impossible.
