It's pretty good here, the availability of fruit and vegetables is amazing! I like some of the food, but am not too thrilled with the huge amount of bread and potatoes in things here. Tinto de Verano is the best invention ever though. :)

I looked at etsy, but never got around to it. I've been making the bracelets while watching TV/putzing around, and they are never going to be a hug money maker.
