I used to be the "saw man" while framing/trim/siding etc. of residential remodels and new builds for a crew of foul mouthed impatient bastards. I don't own a circular saw any more since moving into an apartment and moving away from residential construction as a job.

I do know that given the chance on a deserted job-site, I'd sure as hell grab a tape, circular saw, speed square, and pencil, and yell belligerently for a measurement so I could wield a circular saw like the maniac I used to be. If only for a few cuts, and the smell of freshly cut lumber.
