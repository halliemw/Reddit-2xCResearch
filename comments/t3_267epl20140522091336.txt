You can do this!! I have an 8 month old. The first few months were ROUGH because I had postpartum depression and a hard recovery from labor. You should just go ahead and plan on taking a hiatus for the Spring semester.

But now I am back in the game. I'm teaching a class at the community college. I'm volunteering with my campus ministry again. We can take the baby places and do things with her! I'm not tied to my house anymore. And my daughter is amazing. I can't even express how much I love her.

You are stronger than you know, and you can do this!! And I really suggest looking into babywearing. It's made my life so much easier! See if there is a babywearing group local to you, and they can help you learn how to wrap a newborn properly. It really helps!
