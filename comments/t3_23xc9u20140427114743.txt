They are insecure about themselves, but also pretty deluded. They probably really do think you're too skinny, as ridiculous as that is. The next time they say something like that, tell them that their "jokes" are not funny, and ask them would they make that joke to an *actual* anorexic person? Would it still be funny to them then? Hopefully they answer no and see the error they are making.

They are probably seeing how much you've done and comparing it to themselves because they are doing nothing to manage their health and weight, and it makes them upset. That does not make their behavior okay.
