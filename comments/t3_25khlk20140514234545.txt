I'm not dismissing sexism at all. It's rampant and intolerable, but like racism, its not one sided. Especially in the situation presented. I probably wouldn't have said anything either if it wasn't for the other comments about it. I'm just trying to show the perspective that nothing is one sided, and that sexism is detestable, but not a one way street.
