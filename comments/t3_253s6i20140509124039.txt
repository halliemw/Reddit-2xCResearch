Thank you :) People (women especially) are always appalled when I say I'm not into kids. But I feel it would be more selfish for me to just pop out a couple because it's what is expected of me and my "mind will change when I have my own." But what if it doesn't?Then me and the kid are stuck in a life neither of us want.
