I really recommend volleyball! My sister played volleyball in high school and middle school and she's only 5'5, she was always one of the shortest on the team. In volleyball height pretty much gives you an advantage in every position. She can probably meet more girls (or guys) around her height and taller and this can help her feel less abnormal about her height. I find that when people are self conscious about something it's because they're not surrounded by a lot of people who are like themselves
