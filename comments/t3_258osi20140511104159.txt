This was exactly what I needed to read today. I lost my mother when I was 19, and your experience has been pretty similar to mine. I realize now that I barely even knew her, and I regret not knowing what she was like before she was a mom. She hardly ever talked about herself when she was alive, and when she was diagnosed with cancer I was too wrapped up in my own emotions to think about getting to know her as a person. That is probably the hardest part of all, harder than knowing that she missed my college graduation and my wedding, and will not be there for me when I have children. It's tough for me today, but I feel a little better knowing there are others out there going through this too. Thanks for writing this.
