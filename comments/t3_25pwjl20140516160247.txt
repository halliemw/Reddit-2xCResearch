It's something I agonized over, actually.

I still don't know what a better term would have been that encapsulates enough of the huge variation of women, womanly people, woman-bodied people and femme and butch all.

We aimed for something that was at least broader than 2X, which has also struggled with getting naming right. It's a tough nut to crack and I'm sorry that you don't feel represented by it.
