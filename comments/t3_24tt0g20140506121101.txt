You could have less contact with him.  Don't talk to him unless it's work related and don't see him outside of work.  I know it's hard, because I've done it before, but if you can get over him, you'll be a lot happier.

And pick up a new hobby!  Do things to keep your mind off him.  Go out with your friends, join a meetup group, etc.  Who knows, you might even meet another guy!
