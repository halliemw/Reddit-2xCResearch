If you leave the UTI untreated you could start to have accidents (I know it's embarrassing but this happened to me and it was so upsetting). You have to get antibiotics to knock that stuff out. You can try AZO's products to alleviate the UTI symptoms but it doesn't really help that much in my experience.
