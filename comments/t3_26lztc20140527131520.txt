It's not a matter of "making the boundaries clear", that's the wrong question to be asking.

I mean do you really expect that if a guy is attracted to you and wants to bone you, that if you simply explain/assert a friendship boundary that you will instantly kill any lustful feelings towards you? Humans don't work like that.

Additionally, you cannot pre-empt feelings by asserting a friendship boundary. Feelings are feelings and aren't beholden to an explanation or boundaries. It's not that the guy just "didn't realise" you were only friends, and its not that you "invited" those feelings. It's just that you're a female, and he's a male, and often that leads to attraction rather than platonic friendship. It's as simple as that and there's no real way of declaring yourself "off-limits" as far as attraction goes.

All you can do is be friends with guys, and if one becomes attracted to you and wants you for a girlfriend, and you shut him down, you have to respect his right to not want to be friends with someone he wants more from just as much as he should respect your right to reject his advances.
