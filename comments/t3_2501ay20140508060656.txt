Yeah but by then it's too late. Then there's no talking about it after the conversation goes awry - if it does... I understand your point but I've been screwed by giving benefit of the doubt before and with something life-ruining like unconsented, compromising photos [we all know those stories about the poor girls where it gets so out of hand they committ suicide] I'd be covering my ass and using a buddy system too.
