I'm sorry this happened to you. No-one would think you're being unreasonable by feeling abused. Would you continue having sex with someone if they were crying and trying to pull away? Absolutely not. No reasonable person would continue at this point, or even get to that point. 

It sounds like you were definitely assaulted - that's my view. You trusted this man to love you and treat you with respect, but it doesn't sound like he did either. Maybe you'll feel better if you spoke to someone, like a trusted friend? They will validate your feelings, and it might help you clarify to yourself what happened to you. 

I wish you all the best.
