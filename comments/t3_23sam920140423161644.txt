That does make sense.  But I feel like in that situation I would be financially responsible too...  Switching up the context a little bit: lets say a woman were performing fellatio on a man, and seriously hurt him somehow.  I would think that the two should share in financial responsibility.  I guess that's not how it works, though.  Maybe I'm just wired differently.

I think that pregnancy and your example of the foreskin ripping during intercourse are more comparable to each other.  The only reason I brought up this example is because I feel like in the situation of fellatio, the woman is a bit more responsible for the injury, and I think it's bizarre that she wouldn't have any financial responsibility to it.
