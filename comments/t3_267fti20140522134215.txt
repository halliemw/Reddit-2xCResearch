I cover up when breastfeeding even at my local yarn shop (sometimes) where I've been a regular at weekly knitting nights for almost 2 years, everyone is emphatically pro-nursing-in-public, and I was explicitly told that "you don't have to cover up here." Not once has anyone had a negative reaction. It's just that sometimes I feel exposed.
