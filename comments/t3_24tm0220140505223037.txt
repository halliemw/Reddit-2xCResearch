I just talked to him. He told me that he assumed that I wouldn't want to come, I wouldn't know many people there, or I wouldn't want to go all the way downtown. It makes sense.

Some people are saying they have separate friends from their SO's. My SO and I have separate friends too, but I've been feeling especially lonely since moving out of university dorm rooms and having 4 friends move away for Co-op jobs.
