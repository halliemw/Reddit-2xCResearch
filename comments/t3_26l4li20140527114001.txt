>"Men as a group are entitled and misogynist. Their behaviour is accepted and reinforced by society."

No one is saying this.

We are saying that everyone, *everyone* in Western society grows up surrounded by both subtle and explicit messaging about the way men should act toward women, what a woman's value is, what sex means. Pop culture, advertising - these things reinforce women as "others," as sexual objects, as secondary characters in a world about men's stories; that kind of messaging, intentional or not, leads to certain attitudes about women's worth. These attitudes are pervasive and harmful. This is not an indictment of men. This is an indictment of culture. We should *all* take a good look at the kinds of messages we send our young men and women about how they should see one another.
