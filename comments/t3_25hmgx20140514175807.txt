The thing is that I have many older male professors who I genuinely respect and I feel that they genuinely respect me, and women in general. I understand that older professors come from a time when women weren't in science professions, but that time is over. Over half of my school's PhD students are women, and I would rather support these young budding scientists than protect an older one who "doesn't know any better" (although I would argue he most certainly should!)
