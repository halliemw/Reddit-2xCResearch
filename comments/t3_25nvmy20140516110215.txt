>>Statistically, only about 3%

There is no statistic for false reports about rape.  Anyone who has quoted them to you, including the researchers, are idiots.  There is absolutely no way to measure the number of reports that are false because there is no way to verify what actually happened.

The 3% number is from a British Home Office study where the police classified 8% as false reports.  Basically they said, the police said 8% and we said 3% - because we think the police over report false claims.  

And those are cases where you can even go far enough to designate something as false.  A victim comes in with a shaky story that doesn't make a lot of sense.  The accused claims its a lie.  But his story isn't 100% either.  (Everyone had been drinking, he claims it was consensual, she says she said no, it's 2 weeks on so there's no usable forensics and both sets of friends back thier friends story) 

No charges ever go forward because the case isn't winnable, but you're not going to file it as false reports either.

Is that a false report or an unwinnable case?  Who knows?  

Which takes you to how I "know".  I've been on the job for a while, I've dealt with many sexual assaults and spent time talking with our sex crimes guys who see the actual cases not the official reports and numbers.  

I've taken many reports that don't hold water and the victim then refuses to take any calls or speak with sex crimes detectives.  I'm sure some of those are just cold feet, but I'm also sure that many of them are people who wanted the report but not the charge, or who got nervous when their story didn't hold.

>>Isn't it your job to take the reports and take action?

We don't take action just because someone reported a crime.  We take action when it's warranted and we believe the case can be proven in a court of law.  That's the decision of the officers and DAs handling the case.
