Well, there's a history (mentioned in the article) of studies being done 'suggesting' that women are so affected my their periods that they cant make decisions based on anything but that, which ties into the whole 'woman are too crazy and hormonal for a real decision making job' idea. Now, I'm not saying that the comment you're referring to is correct, but hopefully you can understand a bit of the bitterness (which the commenter states) that brought it on. I think while perhaps a little offensive for you, its a little silly that you get so butthurt over one pretty non-agressive comment to ignore any meaningful things a commenter has to say afterward.
