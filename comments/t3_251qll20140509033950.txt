I think it's not necessarily a moderator puppet but surely someone trying to impersonate a role to encourage responses in a certain direction. The person is pretending/saying to have been influenced heavily by MRA idiology but didn't stumble upon any reasonable feminism along that path? And in the few hours since asking that question he/she picked up how to use language of a bona fide feminist?
