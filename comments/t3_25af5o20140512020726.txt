I am so so sorry about your loss. I agree, they say that time heals but those people took us for a ride. Time is a cheater that way. Thank you for posting this. I will ask Mom to write, now that she has some free time. 

I haven't seen my family in 21 months and I am very very close to my Mom. She had a very tough time bringing us up and we did not have much almost all the time, save the last 2 3 years (I am 26 now). 

I have no idea how I have survived these past months and years and I cannot wait to see her again and all these days, my biggest fear has been that I may not be able to see her again. Cannot imagine life without her. 

I graduated recently and when my advisor asked me how do I feel, I told him that I miss my Mom and that is all I feel. 

I hope you get all the strength in the world!
