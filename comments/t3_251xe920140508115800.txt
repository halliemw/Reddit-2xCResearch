1) Yes, he does want a child.  The pregnancy was just unexpected but we have both discussed having children in the past.  

2)His high paying job hours sucked really bad and he hated it.  He left the job voluntarily for a different one that payed less.  We both knew that we would struggle financially when he quit his high paying job but were willing to take the risks.  It was completely his decision because of his unhappiness, I stood by him and supported him on that.
