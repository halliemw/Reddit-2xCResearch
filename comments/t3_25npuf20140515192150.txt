i'm going to say this in the bluntest way possible: NO ONE CARES. but seriously. i can't even remember the last time i noticed someone had abnormal armpits, probably because the time most people spend studying armpits is about 0%. i think the fact that this is something you're legitimately worrying about means it's symptomatic of a larger issue. do you have other body-related obsessions in a similar vein?
