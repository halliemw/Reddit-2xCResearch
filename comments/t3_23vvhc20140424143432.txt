I've based a lot of my decisions to move based on who I'd be leaving, and how sad I would be. Now that I'm 25, I've started to realize that if I don't make a decision for myself, I'm going to regret it in the future. You need to go to UMass, and try it. It does not mean you'll be gone forever. Nothing is permanent. I know you're upset your niece and nephew, but you may regret your decision to stay in Texas in a few years. Your dreams have been put on the back burner for too long, and you should give yourself a chance to grow a little. Keep in mind you can go home whenever you want.
