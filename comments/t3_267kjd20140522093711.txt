I was on combination BC pills for a little over 5 years before going off of them last summer. After stopping them, it was seriously as if a haze was lifted from in front of my eyes. The mood swings stopped, I was sleeping better, my workouts were much more efficient, my memory improved, not to mention the cognitive fog that I often experienced seemed to vanish. I HIGHLY recommend going off the pill, and the best birth control choice  in my opinion is an IUD. Mirena releases a much lower dose of hormones than the pill, and ParaGard does not release any hormones at all (which is what I now have and love it), plus they're extremely effective! Good luck with your decision :)
