How old is he, out of curiosity? I have two adolescent cats now, about 9 months old, and they are little fireballs. I brought home a catnip toy yesterday and they were bouncing off of every surface in the apartment trying to see if they could get every part of their bodies touching the catnip toy at once. 

We got ours when he was around 2 or so, from the shelter. He was frighteningly thin and bony, with a little crook in his tail. He was probably 8 pounds or so. Within two months of bringing him home, he'd ballooned to roughly his current weight, which last I checked was 19 pounds.
