That was really great to watch, thank you! I'm going to check out their blog/website!

Edited to Add: After only a few minutes of poking around on their site I found this little blurb that really sums me up well (and might help others understand what I mean when I say I'm not fulfilled/happy even though I have the "perfect" life). Thanks again for posting this, it has been really enlightening. 
 
>I had luxury cars and a house with more bedrooms than inhabitants, a bunch of gadgets I hardly used, clothes I didn’t wear, and all the trappings that our heavily mediated culture tells us that we should have. But I wasn’t happy at all, which is perhaps the true measure of success. The people who envied my life didn’t see the other side, they didn’t see the life behind the curtain. I did a good job of masking my fear, my debt, my anxiety, my stress, my loneliness, my guilt, my depression. I displayed a impressive facade, revealing only what I thought the world wanted me to reveal.
