I started on NuvaRing about 6 years ago. I liked the ease of it, but I constantly had UTIs with it. Not sure why. Made sure I only inserted it with clean hands, but something about me did not like it physically being in there.

Moved to Sprintec and liked it okay. I had an alarm set to remind me to take it at 11am every day. It was a hassle, though. The price was good. $9 at Walmart with no insurance.

Then I asked my doctor what would make me stop menstruating. She recommended Skyla because I've never had kids, so it's smaller and easier to insert, my insurance would cover most of it (they actually covered it at 100% after all), and that most women stopped or nearly stopped having periods. It's been my favorite so far. Better skin, no period and lightened mood swings.

Edited to change no Rx at Walmart to no insurance at Walmart.
