Once you have a job, you'll probably make friends there. Also, I used to be the type that had a much easier time befriending boys. I found out that because of that, it is relatively easy to make friends with other girls who also have an easier time making friends with boys.  
  
Also, if you befriend a guy with a girlfriend, you and your boyfriend can offer the idea of a double date.
