Different people will react differently to different products. (LOL I’m not attempting to be funny, i just don't know how to say it any other way)

I’ve heard of lamisil. Is it to be taken orally? If so be careful, as it can cause liver damage. With out re reading your post, I believe you said you have tried the anti fungal "pills"? They did not seem to work. For both the yeast and the hand and foot, I would attack it directly, not through your body. Like I said dryness is probably your best bet (i know you can't really do that with the yeast infection, but i know there are creams and medicated douches you can use, if you have not already,) you need to at least clear up your hands, as that’s just asking for re infection. I can do a little more research for you, and I wish i could send you some money, but the 7 mth old uses up all my extra funds or I definitely  would buy the stuff and mail it to you. I'll take a look, and see if I have any of the tanactin in my house, that’s half way there. I can send it to a P.O box or something. 

All the stuff I’ve recommended is topical. applied directly to the affected area. Here is some info on Lamisil. http://www.drugs.com/lamisil.html

I don't know if that’s the route for you as a typical dosage is 6-12 weeks, and that will run up a nice little drug tab, plus pretty much no caffeine products. That may not be an issue for you however. 

my last point, if the lamisil is for the yeast infection, give it a shot, since its pretty severe. If its for the feet and hands, IMHO I would not hold high hopes. Creams and powders for the external stuff. Sorry I can't be of more help, as i'm not well versed in yeast infection, but i am very good at finding information. I'll see what I can do.
