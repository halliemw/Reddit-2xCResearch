FemaleShameHelp,

I definitely did not mean to imply you do not have morals.  I just meant you should look inward to judge yourself, and do the best you can to let the judgment of others slide off of you.  I do not personally care whether you cover your body or not.  Barring not violating indecency laws, I think you have the right to wear whatever you want.  I'm trying to say if OTHERS say its slutty or immoral or whatever, that its not true, that its what YOU decide it is.  And if you are having trouble deciding what it is or justifying it in a clear and concrete manner that you can stand beside, then you should look to others who may allow you to do so more firmly.

We never have the power to control others.  But we can, with practice, perspective, and time, learn to control our reactions to the actions of others.
