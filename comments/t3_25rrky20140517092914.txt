People have covered a lot of the basics, but my advice is that, if you're going to rely on physically defending yourself (carrying a weapon, learning self-defense), you need to commit to it. You cannot take a week-long self defense course and expect to be safer. If you don't practice a movement regularly, you will never be able to do it in a crisis situation. So if you want to learn to fight back, start taking a martial art regularly.

And if you're going to carry any weapon (gun, knife, baton, pepper spray), know how to use it. For pepper spray, that means practicing spraying it. For a gun, that means learning proper gun safety and basic marksmanship. And for a knife, that means taking knife fighting classes, because a knife with no training behind it will not do you much good.
