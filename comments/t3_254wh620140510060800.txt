The sub will gain about 10k new users everyday as a default.  If we went with 1 mod per 10k, it would be a daily addition.  This growth rate is also why it won't get better, but actually worse.  That said, the community isn't giving up, and I'm a bit proud of that.  I just hope it all works out.  I've sent feedback, as have others, at this point it is up to the mods or reddit admins to decide what is best.
