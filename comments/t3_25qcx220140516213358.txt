You know, I didn't agree with this POV until just now. But you're right, it's great that TwoX is a default now. 

If we surrender and decide to go off of default, these bullies have won. Men have, once again, bullied women into going into hiding. They will have used their aggression to make us surrender, just like they always have. That's what they want and we CANNOT let them have it. 

Their anger and trolling, to me, is a good sign. It means things are changing and it's making then uncomfortable, so they'll try to do anything in their power to shut us up. I genuinely hope the mods stand their ground and don't let these assholes break them.
