There are also what are called sister sizes. The cup changes with the size of the band. so a D is not the same from 28-30something. I can wear a 32D or a 34C. if you go up a cup size, go down a band size, and opposite. Having a fitting done and seeing how it really ought to fit is important. I thought a 34B fit me beautifully but after my fitting and new bras, I can see it wasn't a good match.
