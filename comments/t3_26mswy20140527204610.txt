This article highlighted a lot of issues that I definitely agree with, especially regarding persistence (despite being turned down) as the key to "earning" a woman.  
Why is it there the idea that you "win" a relationship/sex with someone if you "wear them down?"  Doesn't sound healthy for anyone involved.  And yet we see it happen over and over again, both in movies, etc. and in real life (though with significantly less success, no doubt).
