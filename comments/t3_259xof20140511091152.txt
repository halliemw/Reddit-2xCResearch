I second the meetup group idea. I joined a few girls only groups and I've had a lot of fun at them. The key is to finding the right group for you. I went to one group and they weren't exactly my scene (nice girls, just at different places in our lives with very different interests) but another one is a really great fit and I typically go to one of their meetups every week or every other week. You really have to step out of your comfort zone and don't be afraid to ask to exchange numbers if you find someone you really click with. All the other girls are also there to make new friends and will be glad someone broke the ice.
