Your right. He was there a while, but he had been there for what was it like 6 years before being released only to attack some poor woman two months later. Then into the mental facility until this point. He had his chance. There is no reason for him to be let out. He has proven he can't be rehabilitated. Yes, it isn't our decision, but that doesn't mean we can't be upset about it. If there was anything I could do to change such an immensely ridiculous decision I would. Repeat serial offenders like him should not be released under any circumstances, let alone because someone deemed him to be 'fixed'.
