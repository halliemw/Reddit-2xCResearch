Oh god yes.  Or at least in cities.

Many people who are looking to prey on other humans aren't really particular about who.  If its a woman, they might be looking to rob and rape them.  If its a man, maybe they just want to rob and beat them.  Or, you know, any combination of the above depending on their preference.

Sometimes people just want to scare you and get in your head because they think its fun.

Sometimes its just a druggie or homeless person that isn't really a threat, but still kind of get you on edge, cause you don't know how they'll act.

I was walking everywhere I went for about 4 months while I was rebuilding my motorcycle after a crash.  During that period I was attacked three times while walking alone.  Luckily I never had to find out exactly what the people wanted, though I assume they wanted to rob me.

The amount of times I was followed, or yelled at, or in other ways made to feel uncomfortable I can't even begin to count.  Ignoring people and being non-confrontational helped a lot, but being armed and being very willing to run helped out a lot too.

There is no reason anyone shouldn't go walking wherever they want.  Its just probably a good idea to keep your eyes open.
