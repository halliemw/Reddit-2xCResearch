There's a roaring trade in used panties that disagrees with you.  You don't have to find it sexy or attractive, but it exists and no one should feel disgusted about something normal and healthy that their body does (same goes for the guys and their penile ejections).  I'm not saying that everyone should be bringing up their secretions at the dinner table, I'm saying that if it's acceptable to talk about semen, it's acceptable to talk about vaginal discharge.
