I'm on the pill. At first I really wanted to have something else because I didn't like the idea of having to think about it every day and not forget to take it. But when I went to a GP they were offering only two options - the pill or the nuva ring. 

I hated the idea of the nuva ring because I just..don't like to stick foreign objects up there for extended periods of time. It's way to fiddly, weird and mentally uncomfortable for me. So I went with the pill. In the end I don't regret it at all because it turned out to be a lot less complicated. I just put a reminder on my phone for it and picked a good time of day for myself to take it, and so far hasn't missed once.

I also get ZERO bad side effects, I didn't notice any negative changes whatsoever. I did get a great positive change though which is that my periods are now completely pain-free (I used to have excruciating cramps) and a lot lighter.
