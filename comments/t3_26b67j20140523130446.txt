I also found the article really interesting, and I understand the point the author's trying to make. But at the same time, I think bringing up a SO in conversation (if you do in fact have one) is a courtesy to the other individual, especially in settings like bars/clubs where people go to meet potential romantic partners. I think it's a kind way to communicate that I'm not interested in anything besides conversation, and I don't think it somehow invalidates my agency as a woman. This works both ways, and I would definitely appreciate it if a receiver of my romantic interests handled the situation similarly.

I wouldn't lie, though, if I didn't have a SO. And I guess the scenario would be different if I was dancing and a man approached me. Then just stating "I'm not interested" would be more inappropriate, because no other explanation is needed.
