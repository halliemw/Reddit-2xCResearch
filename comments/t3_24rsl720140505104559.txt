In my opinion the most important thing for your first time is that you **trust** the person. You know that they won't push for more than you are comfortable with, or keep going when you need to stop. 

Your first time is rarely perfect - it can be slow, clumsy, awkward, funny, anything. I think doing it with someone trust worthy is more important that doing it with your 'true love' or anything. 

It also never hurts to figure out what you do and don't like in sex before you get in to a serious relationship, in my opinion.
