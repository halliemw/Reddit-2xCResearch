I had an ultrasound once and was super-sore from that, and they were gentle! So that bit may be pretty normal. As for the rest, she sounds like a terrible doctor! Why not call the office and ask to speak to the nurse? You can tell the nurse your complaints, and ask if that is normal, what she recommends for the pain, etc. You could also just tell her you wanted someone at the office to know how unpleasant the experience was.
