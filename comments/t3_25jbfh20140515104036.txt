I'm a teacher in Texas, and we had to have a sit down in one of my classes over THIS EXACT thing. They're high schoolers, and could realistically be called girls and boys, but I always call them ladies and gentlemen. And I insist that they not refer to each other in this condescending way. I make them learn each other's names and use them, if they don't know a name they can say "that student." It's a hard uphill battle, but I'm gonna fight it every day.
