The wonderful thing about getting married is that you are making your own family.  Whether or not you have kids, you and your spouse are a family, and you can build the traditions and patterns and habits that you want to have.  

I know what you mean on the unconditional love thing, though.  I am blessed to have many wonderful people in my life (not least of all my mother-in-law), but I still feel the lack of that kind of love that seems specific to the person who counted your baby toes, and woke up at 2 AM to feed you, and cleaned your scraped knees as you grew.
