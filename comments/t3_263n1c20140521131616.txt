The treatment for most anxiety is exposure therapy. Not all women will do what your ex friend did. The fear has latched onto a genralization that is not useful for you. There are some people who will do what your ex friend did (and not just females) and there are many other people who wont. Get out and meet many people. Trust in yourself that when a friendship isnt mutual that you will be better and better at recognizing it and ending it sooner. Eventually the fear will go down.
