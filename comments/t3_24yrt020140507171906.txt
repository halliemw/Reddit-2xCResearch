there's the (pretty small) [2xLite](http://www.reddit.com/r/2XLite/). 

personally i've been spending more time on [TrollX](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/) than here lately, but it's a slightly different flavor of subreddit

[girlgamers](http://www.reddit.com/r/girlgamers) is another one i read a lot, but it's obviously more gaming-focused
