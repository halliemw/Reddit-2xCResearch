This will probably be down voted to hell but I think they had the right intentions but went about it the wrong way. I went to school where there were a lot of lower socioeconomic students and those engaging in premarital sex almost always ended up pregnant and stuck in the cycle. Yes we want to encourage girls to be educated about sexual health but do I think a 14 yr old should be told it's ok to have sex before marriage? No I don't. I wish I was able to articulate this argument better but I don't think young girls should be told to have sex as long as they are safe.
