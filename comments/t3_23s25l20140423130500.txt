You were in love with him, and a victim of a huge mental and physical trauma. In the midst of all the pain and fear it's no wonder you didn't want him to go. It doesn't make you any worse, and you were not acting stupid in any way.

About the guy-to me, it seems like he did/does care about you. Maybe he was scared of losing control like that again, and hurting you even worse, and that's why he wanted to end it. 

Still, he's obviously in a lot of pain and very unstable. He needs professional help, and i do agree that you need to cut all ties with him for many reasons-  to stay safe, to move on, and to show him he can never treat someone that way again, no matter how bad he feels.
