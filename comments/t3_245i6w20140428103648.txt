I was six feet tall and about 90 pounds going in to high school. I remember I used to be so self conscious because all of my friends, boys and girls, were shorter than me. I think for me I only disliked it because it literally made me stand out from other people, and usually girls at that age would just like to be normal. Of course, now I have gained some self confidence and embraced my height and I'm happy that I'm not "normal".  It wasn't easy, finding this self confidence, but I know at least for me, I had to fake it until I made it. I pretended to love my height and not be bothered that all my friends were so much smaller than me. I could do so many things that they couldn't, and it sounds like your daughter has some talents that are helped by her height too. Urge her to focus on all the positives about her height and assure her that being tall is wonderful! 
My height was something that people noticed immediately, and I was regularly notified that I was tall, which I found incredibly annoying, but it did mean that they noticed me straight away, which was something unique I grew to like. 
You could also tell her that she will get a lot more attention from boys because she is tall, but I'm sure you'd like to avoid getting that idea in her head. :)
