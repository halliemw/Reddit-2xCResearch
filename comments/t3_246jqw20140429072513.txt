Don't worry about other people's fitness, just your own and improving it.  Everybody is good at different things...I'm not the fastest person out there by far, but I have good endurance.  

I find myself more motivated when I'm part of an organized sport.  Currently, that sport is ultimate frisbee, which at competitive levels requires a lot of running and skill.
