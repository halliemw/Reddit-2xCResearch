RES is computer based, not account based, right? Could you get RES on your computer,  pm him something random with a throwaway, and block him once he replies? I'm thinking the block would carry over to your other account as long as you used the same computer. I have an alt account and I noticed my tags are there regardless of which account I'm using.
