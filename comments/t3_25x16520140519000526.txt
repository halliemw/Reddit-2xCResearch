I think the problem here is that you've only built friendships with men and women who are shitty people or who are not looking for friendship.

I've got many female friends who are not Mean Girls-y/dramatic. In fact, I haven't had a Mean Girls-y experience since High School (I think people grow out of it). I've also got guy friends who are just friends and with whom there's never been the hint of romantic feelings. Like you, I used to prefer guy friends to girl friends, but for me it was I think more of an interests thing - in my late teens I felt I had more in common with my male acquaintances. 

Re: female friendships - find an activity with a lot of women in it where you can instead focus on some activity other than talking. Maybe try find a non-competitive activity. I volunteer at a children's museum, lots of women there. Go in aware of the fact that you might be projecting anxieties on these women, and try to not read in too much. If things do turn political, then find a different person to be friends with. For female friends, I find one-on-one to be an easier way to build up a relationship.

Re: male friendships - be careful about hanging out one-on-one for the first while, make sure they're aware you have an SO (which you hinted you do? if not, disregard this point). Don't vent emotionally, which, as the men on /r/askmen say, indicates emotional intimacy on the level of a romantic partner. Don't go to them for help when you need a favour. Don't flirt with them or make a big deal out of the fact that you're female. Don't accept any special treatment due to your gender. Find guys who aren't looking for a relationship.
