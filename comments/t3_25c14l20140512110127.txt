My problem is that she forced me to either lie to my parents, and potentially hurt my already rocky relationship with my father, or tell on her. I'm not willing to sacrifice my father's trust for her mistake. It's not what they did. It's that she broke the rules of my house and has shown she obviously don't respect me. She also snuck into my room while I was sleeping. It's rude for her boyfriend, a guy who has bullied me and I'm not too fond of anyway, to go into my bedroom when I hardly know him, without my permission, and makeout on my bed, all while my parents are in the next room.
