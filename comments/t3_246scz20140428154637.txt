funny enough, it's a lot like Dumb and Dumber (one of my FAVS) those two dudes are going on a road trip for a girl, and its what they talk about for the most part of the movie between the two of them.

Movies like this would only work if they stop casting super hot women in them ... just, normal lookin' funny ladies (i know they exist somewhere!)

One day, ONE DAY we'll get movies like this starring funny women just being funny. And yeah, she gets rejected by the hot dood in the end because shes a loser, and then her and her best buddy walk off into the sunset, goofin' off all the while...
