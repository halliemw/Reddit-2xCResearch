I am not trying to compare the behaviors that are being broadcast, nor am I tryingto suggest that behaviors that are broadcast are shameful. I am trying to make an important distinction between private morality (what we tell our friends and those closest to us, for whatever purpose, including concern for their safety) and public morality (what we tell anybody).  
Now, that said, I don't think being good at sex is shameful, either. But I so think it's reasonable to assume that someone who was very good at sex might have a more strenuous objection to having that information shared with all comers (sorry, pun definitely not intended). What is acceptable (or tolerated, at least), in private conversation is not the same as what is acceptable to broadcast to the public.  
Also, there is another way to answer the objection that this behavior is defensible because it legitimacy warns off potential victims: what if this is just something that is being done out of vengeance? (And how do we make the distinction legitimate concern for other's safety and vengeance, for that matter?)
