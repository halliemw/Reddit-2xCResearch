You can totally skip the placebos and take them back to back! The only reason there are placebo pills is because some women like to have their period (even though it's not a "true" period). I have been taking my pills continuously for over a year! [Here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/birth-control/in-depth/womens-health/art-20044044) is some info from Mayo Clinic.

The only thing is, make sure your doctor writes the prescription to say to skip placebos, or else your insurance will think you're trying to fill them early (since each pack will last only 3 weeks instead of 4) and will eventually deny them.
