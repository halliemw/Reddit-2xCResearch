Former Forensic Mental Health Nurse here. This young man is a risk to others, clearly. It really needs reporting to the police - the likely outcome would be that he would be assessed by the mental health/learning disabilities services for his risk of sexual offending. When I worked for the Probation service years ago, we had a number of learning disabled men who had sexually offended. A problem for them was just as you described - that people made allowances for their disability, whereas in fact, as another commenter has pointed out, he could be injured by someone retaliating in the future. He has possibly not had adequate social skills training and support during his upbringing. I hope this helps.
