I define a strong female character as one who is realistic. What I don't like that happens with female characters in mainstream a lot i that either they're extremely emotional, or extremely devoid of emotions, almost as if a woman who feels can't ever measure up to a man. Well actually, this is an issue I take with a lot of mainstream characters period. These characters should be built like real people, round, dynamic, they won't always know exactly what to do, they won't always do the right thing. 

I think a strong female character is the clones as a collective on Orphan Black. While every clone has her strengths, she also has her weaknesses, they make mistakes and slips, and they grow stronger.
