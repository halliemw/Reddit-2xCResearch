Your mother has been around a lot longer than you and has had many experiences that you haven't. She is trying to help you. You don't have to shave, of course. But imagine for a moment that you were a guy with a neckbeard, and your father said "You know son, you should really shave because that neckbeard isn't a flattering look on you and is probably turning off a lot of people." Would that mean that the father was being an oppressor who was trampling his son's rights, or would it mean that father could see that his son was going to miss a lot of opportunities for sex and positive social experience because of his shaving decisions? Maybe both. But it's not as dramatic as you're painting it and you should consider getting over yourself a little bit. 

Your mother is trying to help, whether it is what you want to hear or not. No need for the vitriol. A simple "This is my body and I will manage it as I see fit. Please respect that " is sufficient. And be sure never to comment on  other people's physical traits yourself, because every exposed butt crack, unibrow, muffin top, and mullet is just as cool an expression of self-determination as your mustache. (I'm not being snarky, that is a sincere statement.)
