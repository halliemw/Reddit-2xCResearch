Exactly.
It's hard not to get resentful after being treated a certain way more times than you can count. It has a tendency to turn one into a closed up, pessimistic person. It definitely hinders one's ability to give the next guy a clean slate when the last just wanted sex and treated you like a piece of meat.

I definitely feel you girl.
Hope that your luck turns around and you get treated with some damn respect by a good guy soon!
