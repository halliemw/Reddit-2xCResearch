They are essentially the same thing. Feminism aims to raise the status of women to that of men in all areas of life.

What about men's issues? Funnily enough, though MRAs strangely don't recognize it, areas in which men are actually the ones being treated unfairly are usually due to established gender roles and other problems created by patriarchy.

Many of the Men's Rights movements issues would be tackled by fighting for feminism. Feminism IS the gender equality movement. Those who actively reject the label, pushing instead for terms like 'humanism' or 'egalitarianism' are just pushing the false narrative that feminism does not support the idea that men have any problems or that it is in some way a female supremacy movement.
