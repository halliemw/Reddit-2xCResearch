I am, too. It's a bummer when people think that we're under more responsibility to not react to terrible behavior than others are to not act that way. I'm doing my part every day trying to get by and get through the garbage I see around me. Why shouldn't others be compelled to do their bit and try to be decent? Go on and think your thoughts, but don't type or yell them out to hurt others!

We do what we can do. I'm a heavy girl and I ran yesterday with a small group of people who meet weekly at a running store. It was a lot of fun, and I didn't feel pressure because we all kind of sucked and we all stuck together. It hurts to think you have to take steps like this to avoid hateful drive-by shouting and people throwing things, but it's nice to run with others, and see the ducks and geese.

I don't think sensitivity is a weakness. It lets me be better at my job, and the other ways I interact with people. Feeling things and being affected by them is hard, but doesn't that mean we're strong in a different way?
