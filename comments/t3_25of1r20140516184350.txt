I was taught that the average street attack lasts 56 seconds.  If one has a solid takedown move, and then can run like hell to a safe place to phone for police or other help, then one's chances of not being raped increase exponentially.  Like all predators, violent criminals do not want to be injured by their prey, and will break off an attack--usually--if strongly resisted.

The course I took showed me the valuable lesson that I could take a slap to the face, and a punch to the gut and still fight my way out from under an attacker to run to safety.  Once again, I stress cardiovascular fitness and the ability to run like hell.

So please, always be sure that you can kick and run in whatever shoes you are wearing.  There is no sense in being footbound.  A high heel can be an effective improvised weapon if you're willing to gouge out an eye with it.

I recommend that women read the book _Men Who Rape: The Psychology Of The Offender_ by A. Nicholas Groth.  I found it eye-opening, as a survivor of gang rape, and also a useful tool when planning never to have that happen again.
