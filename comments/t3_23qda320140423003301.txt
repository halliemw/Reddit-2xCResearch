Its probably just a bad mix of everything sprinkled with teenage melodrama. I think i was most upset by feeling like i wasn't important enough to him... which was the wrong mindset to go into this with. I didn't want him to give this opportunity up, but then I had a lot of chatter in my ears that he should have picked differently. So then i started feeling like it was a ME or THEM situation. And he chose "THEM", so in the end all I felt was hurt.
