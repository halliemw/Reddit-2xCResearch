I've considered bringing it up, but I don't want to sound condescending. Like, hey honey, I know you're working on finding your identity and purpose in life, but I think maybe you should see a therapist. 

I dunno, maybe it's better to bring it up and risk him being offended but getting the help he needs, rather than trying to be passive about it.
