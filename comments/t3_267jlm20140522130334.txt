Religious people do, and many of them will never accept that such beliefs are a mental health issue.  That's sort of the crux of the problem.

Further, my experience with such people is that they have little psychological insight to begin with.  Impulses and thoughts that the rest of us would attribute to our own minds, they attribute to outside spirits and forces.  I really do believe it seems that way to them.  In academic terms, they lack second order consciousness/processing.  This is a cognitive difference, but it is not a common part of any DSM diagnosis.
