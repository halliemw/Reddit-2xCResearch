It serves a couple purposes. Firstly, they really are just that patronizing that they think they know better than you and that you haven't thought this through. Secondly, and this is more important to them (and more fucked), it makes it more difficult to get the procedure. If you have to travel and have limited resources it just puts that much more strain on you (both mentally and financially), and if you're getting near the point in the pregnancy where your state has deemed it illegal to still get an abortion a doctor/nurse/receptionist can stall on you until you're unable to legally get the procedure.
