Losing a friend can be very hard, no matter the cause. If you have made a real effort to share how you feel and attempted to right any wrongs, it's time to let go. It won't be easy, but you will feel better. Friendship is a two-way street and if she is not willing to participate, you can't force anything to happen. I'm going through a similar(ish) situation myself, it's rough, but you can get through it.
