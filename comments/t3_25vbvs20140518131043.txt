Exactly! Wear what *you* want.

I was once in a similar (albeit not nearly as monumental) situation as you are in now. 

Back in high school, I bought a pair of platforms that I thought were the best thing on earth. They were really high platforms, with a plastic wood-like base and jean straps wrapped around the foot. They had a great metal gold-colored buckle to hold it all together. I used to wear them all the time, until my best friend saw them. 

She said they were hideous. That they're cheap and 'too ghetto'. She said I needed to get up to speed with fashion, because I clearly didn't know what I was doing. Needless to say, I put those shoes away and never wore them again.

Last year, I was packing my clothes. I was moving to another country indefinitely, and needed to bring only my *favorite* things. I remember looking through my shoes, and coming across those platforms. I had completely forgotten about them, but fell in love again the moment I saw them. My shoe size hadn't really changed since high school, and they looked so great...

So I packed them in my bag. Just in case.

When my friends saw those platforms, they insisted I wear them. All the time. They were actually surprised that I hadn't worn them in so long. And I felt like an idiot. I *liked* those shoes. Who cares if my best friend thought they were hideous? She doesn't speak for everybody. Most importantly, she doesn't speak for *me*. 

I wear those platforms all the time now. They're my favorite pair of shoes for going out. And my boyfriend thinks they make me look super-hot ;) So that's a plus. But even if he didn't, that wouldn't stop me! 

Nothing should stop you from wearing that dress, and feeling sexy as hell walking down the aisle. Do what *you* want. Wear what makes *you* feel beautiful! What other people think doesn't matter. It's your life, not theirs!
