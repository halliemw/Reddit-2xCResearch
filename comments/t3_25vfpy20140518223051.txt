I am just throwing this out here for perspective, I have one aunt and no uncles. My grandparents on my fathers side (parents of my aunt) are alive and that's all I have as far as extended family goes. My aunt is severely handicapped, mentally and physically. She lives in a group home but is regularly taken to my grandparents and fathers houses for visits and lunch dates and such, she is not forgotten by any means. My father takes care of his sister for the most part these days, as well as his aging parents. It is a lot of stress on him. I think they may have been trying to have another healthy child to spread out the burden a bit. I know my father always tells me if I am going to have a child, to have two, it isn't that much harder to care for another and they will always have each other to lean on.
