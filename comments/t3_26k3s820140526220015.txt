I definitely agree that TRP and other misogynistic Internet forums are a big problem. That said, I wonder what can be done to stop them. Given freedom of expression laws around the world and the nature of the Internet, if someone wants to talk about something on the Internet, it's very hard to stop them. 

I'm not saying we should give up. I'm saying I don't know what to do about it and I hope that someone has a solution. I'm certainly not brushing it off, but aside from personally saying that TRP disgusts me and making that clear to people, I feel like there's little I can do to stop them.
