> Biologically female-female relationships may be discouraged but probably no more than male-male relationships. 

Oh, I dunno about that.  There's been a long tradition in Western European culture that holds male-male friendships are the only real friendships untainted by sexual desire or messy emotions (obviously there are all sorts of flaws with that reasoning, but that's not the point of this discussion).  Friendships between women were viewed as a more utilitarian function - women help each other out because it's hard to raise babies alone, quilting bees are more fun with other women around, etc. etc.
