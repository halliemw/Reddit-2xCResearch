Firstly, I kinda think your hair looks cute as it is, but I'm pining for pink hair in a big way right now.

Secondly, if you're totally stuck with hair you hate there's always hats to distract predators/judgey people.

Thirdly, real advice! This blog is my absolute favorite about dying hair weird colors:

She always has gorgeous, bright, shiny hair. Anyway she recommends for stripping colors conditioning caps (throw a bunch of conditioner on there, put on a shower cap or something, leave it for a couple hours) and soaks in hot water. Dunno if those would help or just strip the blonde you've already done but it's a thought!

Fourthly, honestly dying brown over it is probably your safest option. That'll probably cover that right up.
