I feel like you only skimmed this post or something... 

This guy definitely needs to communicate better, but OP was pretty clear about the reasons she was going off birth control and that she was perfectly happy to get pregnant. She told him that if she got pregnant, she'd be happy about it and said, "IF THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT, PUT ON A CONDOM!" He then proceeded to not wear a condom and then tell her he doesn't want a baby now. 

Second, this post isn't just about what OP should do now. She's upset because she is realizing that she and her boyfriend disagree about something pretty important. She's feeling betrayed because she was clear about what she wanted and asked her boyfriend to step up and he changed his mind when it looks like it might come down to the wire. It's not just about this situation, it's about how does OP deal with the fact that she thought they were on the same page and they clearly weren't. How does she deal with his apparent change of heart?
