I posted this on another person's comment but if you look at every submission in the /r/twoxchromosomes "new" queue, you'll find that pretty much every submission is being heavily downvoted. So it's likely that it's not the /r/twoxchromosomes community downvoting OP, but rather people from /r/all who want to downvote everything from 2XC.
