My dad knows my username because I asked him whether it qualified as an Internet based social network on my job application. I went to get it notarized and he laughed at my username. ( It's not like the employers wouldn't know, they also have our Internet provider and they're the cops... So I figured better come out with it now rather than not list it.) I haven't said anything on here I wouldn't say in person, so I'm not worried.
