Obviously how OP reacts is significant, but don't suggest that this douche bag isn't the one with the power and control here. Whether or not he decides to give out these pictures is what's likely going to affect OP. How she talks to him may or may not determine what he chooses to do.

But you know what will definitely determine what he does? What he chooses to do. So what I object to is the idea that this jerk needs to be appealed to carefully and tactfully and gently, because this is how OP might try and protect herself from his nasty bullshit. That might be good tactical advice. But the way you say it makes it sound like OP is in control of whatever happens, as if her becoming upset would be unreasonable, and if her being upset would "cause" him to put the pics online, and that it would be her fault.

No. If he chooses to do that it is because he chooses to, because he is a shitty, mean, nasty cruel asshole. If he chooses not to it is because he isn't total scum.

Do not try and make this about OP's behaviour. If she treats him like a decent person for tactical reasons that's fine but there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to give him the benefit of the doubt. None. Stop telling OP that how she treats him will determine what he does, HE determines that, though she may be able to influence it.
