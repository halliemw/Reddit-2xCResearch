Uggg, all my progress has stalled and I have a committee meeting coming up, of course I question my decision. I essentially took a pay cut while simultaneously moving somewhere more expensive and leaving all my friends.

But, I knew it would be hard and research goes in sporadic hops. I spent too many years as a tech not to know that. And I also knew that if I didn't go to grad school I would have to leave science entirely or I'd go on a hulk rampage after being condescended to by yet another ignorant post-doc willing to steal my ideas while insulting me for them.

I question it, but my reasoning is still sound so it gets answered pretty fast.
