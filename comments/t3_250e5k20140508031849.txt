The military *does* allow women to shave their heads as long as it is entirely shaved. "Trendy" part shaved/part unshaved styles like [this](http://imgur.com/L5Iq49M) are what is banned. 

Cornrows, dreadlocks, and braids aren't allowed for men either *because they don't allow headgear to fit properly.* It has nothing to do with how professional or unprofessional it looks. 

IMO, the male and female standard should be the same for everything in the military, including hair. The double standards just causes problems for both genders.
