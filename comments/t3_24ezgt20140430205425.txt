Much of the petition makes no sense, for the points noted above. Look:

> 1\. Require that all students found culpable of sexual misconduct be, if not expelled, suspended from the University for at least two years, or until the victim in question graduates; whichever is longer.

This kind of harsh punishment only makes sense in the light of rather serious accusations. And very serious accusations are criminal matter and need to be tried. 

> 2\. Adopt a definition of affirmative, inclusive consent as the standard for consent in the Student Code of Conduct.

Again, this is a matter of law. Universities have no business defining their own version of consent. 

This is a group of students, who have some power in their academic institution, trying to form their own paralegal system that they can have some control over. That's not how it works.
