I was your friend several years ago. I lost one very dear friend over it and two other close friends sat me down and had a serious intervention. I've read a few of these stories over the years and I want to go back to me 5 years ago and whack her upside the head.

If she is like me, she's not going to listen to you or to reason. I had to basically bottom out before I listened to what anyone had to say. My family and friends didn't want him around for any reason and THAT didn't sink in. Losing a friend, almost losing two more and being at my most physical and emotional lowest finally shook me out of it.
