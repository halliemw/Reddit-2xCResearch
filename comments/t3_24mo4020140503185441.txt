My mother has bipolar (quite severe). A lot of the stress and anger between us lifted when I moved out (in a non ideal situation, at 17 to my boyfriends parents place). I see her at least once a week and still help out with chores and some social support, but she no longer leans on me first (or only) having a large hold over my life. Taking time out is really hard in a live in carer role due to the guilt and duty. I was trying to help her but also shield my sister and father from having to help, now they take on a bit too and we each can have a little time out. You're not too much help supporting someone if you're all burnt out!
