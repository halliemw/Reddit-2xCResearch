What's wrong with being a hippie?

I orders mine on Amazon. I decided on the Sckoon Cup as opposed to the Diva Cup because it has no lettering on the cup and the stem isn't hollow,. These things should make it easier to clean. Unfortunately, my period hasn't started yet, so I haven't actually been able to use it. Plus, this cup comes in a bunch of fun colors. There are certain grocery store like Whole Foods and Central Market where you'll probably find Diva Cups, but they never have a very wide selection.
