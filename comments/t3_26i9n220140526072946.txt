> She said she "lost her wallet."

And her cellphone apparently. Even if you don't work for a babysitting agency, it may be good [revenge] to google any that are in your area and see if they have a place where you can report parents for pulling stunts like this. It'll stop other babysitters from being taken advantage of like this, and may teach her a lesson when she can't find anyone to dump her kid on the next time she wants a free weekend (assuming she'd actually stay with the kid instead of leaving it w/o a babysitter. Definitely report this to CPS).
