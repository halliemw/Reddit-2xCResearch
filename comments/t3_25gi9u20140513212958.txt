Plus why am I going to go out of my way to not offend some asshole? I don't pump -- didn't even get the replacement tubing this time, because I hate pumping and I'm a SAHM. 

They should be thankful I cover my boob. I don't have to.

But I don't look around when I'm nursing so anybody who wanted to get on my case would be doing it without the tacit eye-contact conversational opener. That makes them extra assholey.
