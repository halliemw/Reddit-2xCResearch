This is exactly the problem I'm experiencing right now, and why I'm just considering calling the whole thing off until I... I dunno, see the light or whatever. Sex is a fun activity for me, but it's not so important that I can't do without for the foreseeable future.

Edit after your edit: Ooh! I'm glad someone touched on that question. It seemed like kind of a weird moral gray area. So hypothetically, is it just up to me to decide when I think they're being untruthful?

Yet more edit: It may be important to clarify that I have great difficulty recognizing the difference between friendship, lust, and romantic affection. Which is kind of why I'm in this mess so often. I know this complicates things, sorry.
