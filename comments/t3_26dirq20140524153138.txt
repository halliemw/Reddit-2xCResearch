im just wondering why the act of shaving one's genitals is a righteous, or even valid, criticism.

it almost seems like a discriminatory statement.

people don't like to be called "spear chuckers" or "camel jockeys", but i guess "PUSSY SHAVERS" is an OK thing to call someone. i see it being commended in these comments.
