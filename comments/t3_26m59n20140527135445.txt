unfortunately i have been through the same situation that ended up with me having to move out 
because my room mate decided to live with his girlfriend.
i think you should have a mature conversation with your room matte, comunication is really the key. if you keep things for yourself that bother you (and this is your home) it won't help you at all. If i have had an honest conversation stating whatever agreement you guys have as room mates and that you have not being informed is the best you can do. i know, nobody wants to be the bitch but you'll end up losing space and privacy so i think you should stand up for it.  no need to be agressive or anything. just an honest conversation.
