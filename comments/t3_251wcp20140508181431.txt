It is getting better with time. 

Except that normal men are taught all the time that certain behaviors are okay. It isn't a problem with the men, it's a problem with the idea of what is okay from masculinity. If you pay for a date, she owes you something, it's okay to excuse someone's behavior with "she's on her period", "don't try to understand women, women know women and they hate women", "I'm not like other girls" used as a line by women who are taught that women are lesser. 

To claim that "normal" men are incapable of things like that is not only incorrect, it's dangerous. It is dangerous to assume that because then it means we brush aside these incidents as just "fucked up". "He wasn't right in the head", "Not all men are like this", and that may well be true, but it does little to nothing to stop them. We are providing excuses for a real problem, not addressing it.
