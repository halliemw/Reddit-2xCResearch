I've been reading a lot of stories about women on Reddit getting abortions. I'd just like to say, and this is going to sound off, but thank you for the educational experience. I'd also to say I'm glad you're feeling okay. I'd imagine that's fairly traumatizing. I could never get an abortion, but I can't really judge those who do. I would like to ask though, and I'll get it if you don't want to answer, but based off your last sentence, do you regret it?
