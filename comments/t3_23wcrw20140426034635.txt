Definitely check out r/skincareaddiction. It's truly a healthy addiction :) I live on that site and they are very positive and welcoming :) 

I'm 40 and not to brag, but my skin looks pretty damn good compared to others my age. If you do nothing else, use sunscreen. Not just your face but your neck, chest and hands also. Skincareaddiction will give you more info than you'll know what to do with lol.

Start with their beginners routine in the sidebar and go from there. Your at the perfect age to start with all this. 

I also find that taking fish oil caps once a day make my skin look luminous and more healthy/plump.
