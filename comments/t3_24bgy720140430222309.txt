No, saying "that's probably not a safe environment" and "going is bad" are two different things.  She may be comfortable around a highly sexual atmosphere, but since she and the company know little about the potential client they don't know if this is a place for women to be sexually liberated or harassed.

Also, I've never, ever been near a strip club I feel safe.  I'm sure they exist, but they're basically unicorns in my part of town. :/

As I said, in theory there is nothing wrong with her going.  But reality is fucking mean.
