Just do what I do. If my mom comments on my fuzzy legs I just yell "touch the furriness" and jump after her holding up a leg. She's pretty much knocked it off. Your letter sounds way too serious and it's obvious she's getting to you, just respond with humor and be clear you don't take it seriously and she'll knock it off
