#1 thing: TALK THIS OUT IN A NON-CONFRONTATIONAL MANNER.  I almost guarantee he has NO friggin clue that he's being such an ass.

Y'know... women's fashion is the center of the fashion world, and he may enjoy all the freedoms and variety women's fashion has available without being considered too "out there." Really there's less creativity in men's fashion.... he might also see the way that fashion on a woman is acceptable commentary in everyday media... therefore he hasn't the slightest clue what a total douche he's acting like.

I'm not trying to excuse his actions.. I'm trying to say that there's a clear framework for his actions, and that's why it's so hard to get him to realize his behavior is hurtful.... you're having to take in a whole culture norm.

Give it the good fight.. but if you can't seem to name him realize that it's mean to be critical of your perfectly normal appearance constantly then it may be time to dump him
