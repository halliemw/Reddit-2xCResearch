I'm going to start doing this. He "apologized" to me this morning, but I later found out he then went to my manager to tell him he'd done it and get kudos. Idk, I'm trying not to be paranoid but it feels like an abusive relationship where the abuser buys flowers when he's gone too far.

EDIT: I don't use that example lightly, either, I've watched the process many times in my life. Goes too far, reels the person back in with a kind gesture, etc.
