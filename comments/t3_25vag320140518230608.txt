I think the premise of this idea is a good one – sometimes you just have a day or two where you can't come in, and that should be offered by your employer, and stigma-free. But guys should get random days off as well. It shouldn't specifically be for periods, but maybe any two days where someone needs time off they get it, no questions asked.
