I cut my hair short because I want to and for no other reason. In fact the only thing that held me back was this notion that women should have long hair, which is sexist. 

This is a subreddit for women, by women. Not a place for you to come in an spout your opinions about how my body should look or how women are just looking for attention. You don't speak for any majority. Go fuck yourself.
