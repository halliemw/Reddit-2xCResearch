I was looking at 32B bras and the model looks pretty straight up and down to me, not hourglass. http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/bundle_filter.jsp?productId=0796_0337_100&parentCatId=cat6870400&bundleId=cat6870153&guide=bra&cup=b&band=32&N=4294963710+4294963708+4294963630&catId=cat6880045&available=false  (the first girl)

Not my body type at all, so it doesn't really appeal to me.
