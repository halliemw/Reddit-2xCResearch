I do have an Etsy store!

I don't have a ton of public stuff up yet, but I'm close to expanding the selection!

I got a loan from family to buy the printer. I fooled around with them in college and found I really liked the technology. The hookshot is just under 6 hours of printing, and many more hours of sanding, prepping and painting. I don't have an airbrush yet, though that's going to be my next investment. I'm currently using spraypaint and lots of superglue.
