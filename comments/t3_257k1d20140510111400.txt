If it has been at least two hours since you took the pill and you vomit, you should be okay.

Also want to add, there are SO MANY options that people do not seem to know about.

* [Two types of IUDs](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/iud-4245.htm)
* [Depo-Provera Shot](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-shot-depo-provera-4242.htm)
* [Implant](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-implant-implanon-4243.htm)
* [Patch](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-patch-ortho-evra-4240.htm)
* [NuvaRing](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring-4241.htm)

These are longer-term, involve less-hassle, and may be a better option for you! If you don't like how the birth control you are on makes you feel, do some research and find something better. You shouldn't have to be uncomfortable or unhappy to prevent pregnancy.
