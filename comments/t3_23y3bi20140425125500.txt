I agree with both perspectives. I've always been thin, but I've also always had problems with my body. My body stores fat in weird places (even when very healthy/eating right/working out/thin I have lower stomach fat and my thighs touch at the top) and I'm covered in moles. I hate it! I also have a smaller chest than any woman I am friends with or who I see post online. I assume when people look at me they think I'm lucky and probably never have serious insecurities, but I absolutely do. I would never post my body online, or anywhere else, because I do not think I'm at my best nor will I ever be, no matter how hard I try.

At the same time, many of the women who do post about themselves, do look like society demands women to look. So it can be frustrating if you're an atypical looking lady.
