The bleeding caused by pausing hormones is called a withdrawal bleeding. It happens as a, well, withdrawal symptom when the hormone levels in the body drop. 

But you're right, I should've been more clear in my post: yes, you bleed, but it doesn't mean there has been an ovulation and it's not part of the menstrual cycle.
