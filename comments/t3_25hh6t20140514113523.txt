now a days, some woman see this as bad. And their reasoning behind this is "if a guy does it so do I". I mean you shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable at all at expressing your decision (nor there is nothing wrong with it). I'm personally the same way, I will wait till marriage because of ME, not because of the guy I'm with, it's something I do for MYSELF. I don't judge my friends that chose to have one night stands and just do it when they feel like it, it's not something I would do but to each it's own, but I always get the "are you crazy" speech from them for choosing to wait.
