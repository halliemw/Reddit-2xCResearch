I don't have an engagement ring (I proposed, and don't like diamonds). My husband and I got our wedding rings as a set (both damascus steel in the same etched woodgrain/swirl pattern with bevelled edges).  My husband was really attached to the idea of us having clearly matching rings.

When we were shopping, we saw lots of individual/mismatched rings, lots of his/hers sets, lots of engagement/wedding ring sets, and some three piece sets (his, hers, engagement). Pretty much anything goes.
