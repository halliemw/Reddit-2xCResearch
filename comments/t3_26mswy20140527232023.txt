I hope that in the midst of all of this, it isn't forgotten that there are also a lot of (good) men who never even begin to see women as "prizes" or something to be won.  They simply want to be with someone, desire for companionship that is a deep part of every human being... but they just don't have the personality and/or looks to attract anyone (maybe they are slightly awkward).  So, like any other human being, they try to adapt - use their strengths to try to cover their weaknesses.  Perhaps they are smart, so they work on getting a good career.  Imagine, then, how heartbreaking it is to find out that after years of working on getting a great job, even that is not enough to cover their shortcomings.  These men don't blame women, they blame themselves for not being able to be good enough despite their best efforts.  It hurts emotionally, but they would never take it out on other people.
