I'm not sure it's really possible for me to know.  Almost certainly it is a mixture of influences, but the ratio I just can't be sure about.  I *feel* differently about things, and a lot of that internal sort of subjective experience I think was most strongly affected by hormones, and those new feelings lead me to act in different ways.  But so does the social expectations I perceive in this new role, especially those that regard appearance and behavior.  I can't ignore, nor do I deny, that influence.
