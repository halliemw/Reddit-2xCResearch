> This is a critique of PUA/redpill/fanatical MRA culture, not of everybody who identifies as male.

For *some* people, it is.

However, just as common are the people that say this is symbolic of "male entitlement" or "misogynist patriarchy."  In both cases they are attempting to portray Elliot Rodger's viewpoints as supported by and representative of wider society.

Also, PUA, redpill and MRA are three completely different groups.  Seriously, those groups hate each other, so it doesn't make much sense to constantly group them together.  Also, there is little evidence that Elliot Rodger was heavily involved in any of those groups.  In fact, he was anti-PUA.

It's funny because when this initially came out people were blaming the MRM and PUAs because Elliot Rodger was supposedly a PUA.  When it was revealed that he was *anti*-PUA the narrative didn't change.  PUAs and MRAs were still blamed.
