I tend to get them a lot on my legs these days, because I have trichotillomania (obsessively pull out hairs) and pull them out now and then, which lets them grow back under the skin. Exfoliation helps, as do those pointy-nosed tweezers (although those do tend to scratch a little and sometimes makes me bleed a tiny bit, which makes little scabs).
