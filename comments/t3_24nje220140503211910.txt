I just wanted to chime in and reiterate a lot of what other people have said.  I started my period the summer before fifth grade, and I remember my dad (!?!) bringing up that I needed a training bra in third grade (so around age 8).  While I think it's awesome that you are so in touch with your little sister's life, please please please remember that there is nothing wrong with going through puberty, whether she's the first in her class or the last.  You can talk with her pediatrician about it (out of her earshot!), but if you show her that you're concerned with it, she might put that anxiety on herself and think that something is wrong when she's just going through normal changes.  I second (and probably third and fourth) getting her some books...I remember particularly loving the American Girls book (http://www.amazon.com/The-Care-Keeping-You-Younger/dp/1609580834) though who knows what appeals to kids these days.  Let her know that you're there for her if she needs to talk about anything, but otherwise just let her be.  Even though I was an early bloomer, no one in my life ever approached it like it was something of concern, and I was never too worried about it.
