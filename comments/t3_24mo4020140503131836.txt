First .... I'm sorry this happened to you.  It shouldn't. Parents are supposed to love and protect, not demean and terrorize.  Second,  your father is a bully.  I think you did great standing up to him.  The reason he DIDNT hit you I think is because he was unsure if you'd hit him back.  Bullies are, at the heart of things, scared things. So while a large part of you is scared of him, keep in mind that he's now afraid of you, too, to some degree. 
I'm not going to repeat what others have said here about leaving, because all of it is just great advice.  I agree that you really need to leave.  You're responsible for one person and that is YOU.  You can't be responsible for your mother's broken heart or your father's fear.  It's your turn to build a life.  Now get out there and do it. 
Oh, and if he really DOES hit you? Don't cry, don't whimper, don't cringe.  Look him right in the fucking face and say "I'm sorry you're so scared of your daughter " then leave.  If you're anywhere near Reading, PA, message me.  I have a spare room and a bad attitude for men who think they can't hit anyone.
