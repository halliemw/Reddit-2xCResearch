Man, if you are both over 21 (check!) anything less than 5 years doesn't even register as older/younger to me. Nobody would even blink at your difference if it was the other way around. I have never hear any woman say she is dating an older guy .... by describing a 2-4 year difference. 

It's not a big deal. If you like him and he likes you go for it!
