No; I went to school in California and the Northeast; I now live overseas.

I don't get a lot of sir/ma'ams, but I wouldn't consider it disrespectful IF it is used in a context where "sir" would be used for a male professor. If, on the other hand, it is used where a male professor would be called Dr./Prof., then it would be disrespectful. 

The thing I would consider disrespectful is to call a female professor "Ms./Miss/Mrs. So-and-so" -- she has a title; use it.
