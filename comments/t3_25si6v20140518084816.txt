So because women were silenced its a good idea for them to silence others??

That makes no sense whatsoever.  As Martin Luther King said, "an eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind."

Furthermore, your attitude sees feminism as "revenge" against "men" for oppression against women.  Is that the image of feminism you want to project?  Think about that.
