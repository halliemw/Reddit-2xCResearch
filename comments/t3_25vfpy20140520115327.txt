I don't think bodily autonomy should trump inflicting suffering on a non-consenting 3rd party. She is creating a human life that will suffer when she has it within her power to do not that.

As the saying goes, "your right to swing your first ends where someone else's nose begins."

How long would you like this child to live and suffer in order to service this principle of bodily autonomy that apparently trumps everything else in your moral view?

5 years of suffering before dying? 20? Maybe if the child is lucky they'll suffer some horrible incurable conditions for a full 70-80 years!
