I work as a Benefit Brow tech. My opinion would to be to either go to a Benefit Brow bar and let them teach you. MAC, Anastasia, and Sephora could help too. It's actually pretty easy. 

- Take a makeup brush or pencil or whatever you have. The start of the brow should be the tear duct so hold your utensil in front of your tear duct and against the forehead. Taking a pencil or concealer draw a line. That is wear your brow will begin.

- Now for the arch of your brow! Place your utensil on next to the edge of your nose and threw the middle of the pupil. This is the highest point of your brow. Mark that point.

- Almost there, end of brow! With the utensil still at the edge of your nose move it to the outer corner of your eye. This is where your brow ends. Mark that point.

- You are allowed to adjust the points as you see fit. Instead of going in and tweezing everything in sight use your pencil to connect the dots with two straight lines. Then go in with concealer and conceal the hair. This way you will get a visual of what your brow will look like. Use more concealer to make it thinner looking or less to give a fuller brow. You can have a pointed arch or round it off. I would just play with some cheap, thick concealer and matching brow pencil till you get a shape you like.

And for the love of every god and goddess I can think of PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't use a stencil or go to a nail salon. Go to a professional esthetician or cosmetologist.
