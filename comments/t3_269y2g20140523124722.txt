I can't do anything diet wise. I'm on a feeding tube and do not eat at all by mouth. Fitness is a different thing. I'm working on a couch to 5K program :-). I like your ides of talking to your doctors about it and putting itbin the chart. I'll discuss it with my PCP and have her make a note of it. I think my obgyn has some notes on it too already since she's been on my team for years. Even before I was sick.
