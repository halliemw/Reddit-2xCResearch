Haha, glad my pain could ease yours. :D

Honestly, now that I'm not forced to see them as often, it's so much easier to remember the good bits about them and not dwell on the dread. And when I do see them a couple times a year when they come here or we go over there, it's so much easier to be engaged and have a good time. Hope it gets better soon!
