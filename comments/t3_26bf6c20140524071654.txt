I guess if we're talking about something that all women experience, I'd point to examples in pop culture or the media. 
For example, Hollywood keeps insisting that a Wonder Woman movie isn't feasible because movies with female leads don't do well at the box office...even though the top three movies of 2013 were "The Hunger Games," "Gravity," and "Frozen," all of which had female leads.
Or if you look at the way sex scenes are filmed in mainstream movies; they're all filmed through a straight man's perspective. It's perfectly acceptable for a teenage boy to have sex with a pastry ("American Pie"), but the MPAA balks at a teenage girl masturbating through her nightgown ("But I'm A Cheerleader"). There's a great documentary about the Hollywood rating system called "This Film is Not Yet Rated." [Another example of the straight man's perspective in Hollywood: Heath Ledger stabbing a man through the eye with a pencil ("The Dark Knight") gets a PG-13 rating, but if he consensually kisses another man ("Brokeback Mountain"), that's rated R.]
Or you could look at the way women are photoshopped in magazines. They're altered to fit an impossible standard of beauty.
