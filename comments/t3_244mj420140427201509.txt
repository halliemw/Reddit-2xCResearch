The clinics may overexaggerate the need, but I think the need comes from a desire to provide their prospective egg recipients with a wide array of options of donors from which they can choose.
The success rate depends on each clinic, the mother's age, as well as her health conditions, but for IVF generally, the national average is 47% for women under 35, and of course, this rate diminishes significantly with age. 
The clinic that I went to boasted a 74% success rate for the same age range.
