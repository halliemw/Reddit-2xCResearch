Do the counseling. My wife and I went through some rough times when she was pregnant. There is a lot going on here. I think that as a man his stress level is topped out right now, he is worried about you, worried about money, worried about his marriage, worried about how he will be as a father...worried about everything. To top it off he has absolutely NO CLUE what you are going through, he can't possibly know, and that worries him most. Honestly I thought my wife just flipped a switch and started hating me. Men aren't good at dealing with hormonal changes, we are creatures of habit.

He will do the counseling, begrudgingly,  but he will do it. Just keep in mind that the counselor may tell you both things that you don't want to hear and you have to be willing to accept it.
