Well this is a bit of an embarrassing story.  I don't remember exactly what it was like, but my mom has never really been supportive of me, so I didn't tell her.  I was 10 years old at the time.  My mom only used tampons at the time and there were no pads or liners in the house, so I went to school wearing 3 pairs of underwear and shoved a giant wad of toilet paper on the crotch of my underwear.  I didn't tell the school nurse or anyone else either.

My mom found out when she did the laundry a couple days later and found my bloodstained underwear and she talked to me about it.  I remember being upset and freaked out, not at the blood, but because I had always been told that girls don't get their periods until 13-14.
