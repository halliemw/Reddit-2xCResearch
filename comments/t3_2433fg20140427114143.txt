The staring is terrible, I have that feeling from the workmen (from India and Bangladesh) in Singapore, and when I visited Malaysia it got even worse. I was 16, and I tried to tell my dad and he said it was "just because I'm white" but the way they were looking wasn't a "look a white person" type stare.... It really sucks
