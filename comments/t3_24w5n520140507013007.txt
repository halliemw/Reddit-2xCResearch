Her picture is believable, and I think it's more eye-catching and conversation worthy than it would be with her top on. She looks smashing in tops, but very average and we'd flip the page and move on. The photo of her real body, her real belly, is the sort that we would flip back to and gawk a bit. We'd search for an article, what's this woman's story? She must've been huge! How does she feel about her body now? Does she look in the mirror and think "amazing!"? Do cats try to knead that bread? Does her husband totally love it? Do her boobs stand up on their own? 

It's a bit more than "LOL! I can wear a size 6 dress now, no more Addition-Elle for me!"
