Well, that's true, but rape-apologists are going to say whatever they're going to say (and they're not necessarily the actual rapists).

I just think it's interesting (did you read the actual article?) that women who are conservatively dressed are considered more passive (I don't think it's rapists only who think this).  Lots of factors in it, but an individual sense of style might very well denote an individual sense of power to many people.
