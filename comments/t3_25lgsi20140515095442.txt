Ahh, I love hearing stories about people who made it work after a couple of years. Our relationship is great, we're very communicative; we've been "long-ish" distance for our whole relationship while I was at college 3 hours away, so we know what it's like to go a few weeks without seeing each other. But several months between each meeting is going to be a little harder.
