That sort of result can resolve itself over a period of time with no treatment - so I don't think there should be a lot of concern and I don't think she is self-destructive.  Frankly, why should she go through a coloposcopy without a repeat pap test first after a period of time.  Maybe she does not trust the physician. See if she'll ask around for referrals to someone else.
