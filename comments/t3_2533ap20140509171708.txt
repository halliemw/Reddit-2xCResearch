Growing up, I wanted to be my older sister, who had quite long hair. Having it cut pretty short on my mother's orders was devastating at the time, especially since I envied my sister's relationship with her. It took nearly a decade from that until I decided to cut it short, and the only time I let it grow longer since then was when I decided to have it cut off and shaved off for a cancer charity.

Considering the number of hair product commercials and the emphasis on women's hair in almost anything they appear in, I think it becomes a symbol taking a lot of space and probably a lot more importance than it should.
