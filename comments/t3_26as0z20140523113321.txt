I read everything here for ideas, but only added to my anxiety. DH is retiring soon and all he ever has done is go to work, come home, eat, watch TV, and half do "projects".  I have done everything.  Bills, fix the car, keep up the garden and yard, cook, clean, raise the kids, arrange the holidays and his parties.  I even had to do all the work for my own 50th birthday party. I hate myself for letting this happen.  If I can't figure out how to handle his retirement without me continuing as a doormat, I am gonna flip out and on day just throw a suitcase in the car and drive off into the sunset. Kudos to you for planning it up front. I was taught growing up to do this, swore I'd never do this, and 30 years later, here I am.
