Cheating can be different things in different relationships. For some people, emotional cheating is just as big a thing as physical cheating - in fact, I personally would be more hurt by my partner emotionally cheating than physically. 

To OP, it seems he was cheating. He crossed a boundary with another woman. That's as much as we need to know.
