Even Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton are critiqued on their appearance, though. Some of it is seemingly positive, like how people dote on Michelle Obama's toned arms. Others are very negative, like making fun of Hillary Clinton for her "manly" pantsuits and calling her a nut cracker. Even the "positive" compliments are really negative, though, because they teach people that what matters is how these women look.

The problem is that even these women in leadership roles who should be critiqued for their ability to lead & motivate are instead critiqued on appearance. I still put that in the same general category of problems like the over-sexualization of many fictional female characters. The point is that women are told they need to be sexy & attractive to be worthwhile, even if their appearance has nothing to do with what they do.
