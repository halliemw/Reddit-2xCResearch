I have thought of that, and it really makes me nervous :( Fortunately, he is not a mama's boy. In fact, I would say that he resists his mother's attention. But, there is a part of him that still loves his mom and the rest of his family. To me, just because someone is a family member, does not necessarily mean you have to like them or whatever. He does not share the same opinion. 

The good news is that he doesn't get mad at me for disliking them, and he understands because he knows how they are. I don't THINK he will constantly be going to see them, but I guess there's no way to know right now. I hope I don't end up in the same boat as you did!
