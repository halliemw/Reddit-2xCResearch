When I got tested at PP, I asked for a copy of the results. They printed them, no problem! 

The only catch is that if you get tested for HIV, they won't tell you the results over the phone (and won't mail you a copy), no matter what the result is. You HAVE to set up an appointment to be told the results in person. 

It sounds like he either didn't get tested, did get tested but hasn't gone back to actually receive his results, or he didn't request a copy, and is being lazy about it. 

(I might be slightly biased here... I was in a similar situation a few years ago, and in the end, it turned out my ex didn't have a copy of his test results because he had lied about being tested in the first place!)
