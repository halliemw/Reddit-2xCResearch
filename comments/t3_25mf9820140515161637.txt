I know how you feel, I'm 25 and have no piercings in my body whatsoever, I mean I wanted one in my eyebrow at some point but never came to it, and now I really don't see myself with my ears pierce, not my style at all, plus I'm 100% sure I would lose all my earrings. My friends had tried to lure me to do it and even try to do it innocently themselves but to not success
