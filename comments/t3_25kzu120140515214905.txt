You don't need a boyfriend, but you also shouldn't let fear or self-doubt close you off from possibilities of a rewarding relationship. Don't assume all men are cruel, don't assume everyone thinks you're a failure. Guys are people, each one with their own thoughts, opinions, and personalities, so each guy will react differently to things. Basically, I'm saying, give people the benefit of the doubt and you might be surprised at how kind and supportive they can be.
