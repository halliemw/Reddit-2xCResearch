Exactly. Those are incidents of women refusing themselves to men, what this thread is about. That might be straight up refusal or refusal of further involvement with him.

> it is also worth nothing that this is 286 deaths in a population of 318 MILLION

If I am not wrong the UK has 63 million and not 318 million inhabitants. (You are quoting UK numbers here.)

And to put that into perspective (whatever perspective your are trying to create here): in 2012 a whole of 1,754 fatal road incidents occurred. I doubt 200 of them were animal involved. (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reported-road-casualties-in-great-britain-main-results-2012)

Now, if that cute deer you drive past would lift its sniper rifle and point it at you 'cause you are a dirty damn car driver' then we would be talking fitting analogies.
