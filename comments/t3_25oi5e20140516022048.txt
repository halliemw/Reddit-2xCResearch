My parents are kind of like yours, but they're 40 years in.  Actually, it's hard to believe they ever really liked each other.  When I was in college and had my first boyfriend, I realized I had no idea what normal couples do when they spend time together.  That was a really uncomfortable insight at age 18.  

I do not believe that simply knowing "X behavior is bad" is enough to go on in life.  You need input on what to do instead.  Example: I know it's bad to yell at kids and call them stupid, because my dad did that and it really messed me up.  But that knowledge doesn't magically implant in me the words you say instead when your kids are working your last nerve.  

What I did about it: You can look into self-help books about relationships, certainly.  John Gottman has written a lot about the qualities shared by successful relationships.  If you want to cut to the chase and can afford it, I can't speak highly enough about the benefits of a good therapist -- they're like a personal trainer for your brain, who can point out the less effective ways you are doing things and help you exercise new muscles.  You could definitely get a crash course in effective communication from a great shrink.  Or seek out premarital courses and couples workshops in your area -- it'll get you the basics.   

Also, I would tell your boyfriend the patterns you notice in your parents and ask him to tell you if he notices them appearing in your relationship.  He will most likely reassure you that you are nothing like your parents, but I would still want this information out on the table in a serious relationship.
