Sorry I should've addressed this sooner. He is not violent at all, I feel completely safe around him. He actually was the one I turned to when I really was in an abusive relationship. The thing I fear is that telling him I'm pregnant could grow a sort of attachment that is undesired. I don't think he would try to "tie me down" with the pregnancy at all, but he has always wanted a serious relationship with me that I never wanted.
