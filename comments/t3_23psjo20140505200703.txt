Update:
I am going to write down my exact experience in case others are thinking of going the route I went.

I decided to have an abortion very very early in the pregnancy. The most helpful thing was that I have been using an app on my phone for almost a year where I mark down when my period comes, when I have sex, and keep notes in general. So when I checked the app (it's called Clue) and saw that I was 4 days late which is very unusual for me, and I could also see that I had sex when I was ovulating, I was pretty sure I was pregnant and also knew exactly how far along I was.

When I had my medical abortion, I was only 23 days pregnant. The fetus could not even be detected in the ultrasound, and they only knew that I was pregnant because of my urine and blood test.

I had been warned on reddit and by the doctor at the clinic that the process would be very painful with a lot of blood. 
When I took the first dose of misoprostol on Friday, nothing happened for the entire day. 24 hours later on Saturday I took the next dose of miso and again, nothing happened. Then on Sunday I started light bleeding. Over the next 7 days I bled roughly the same amount as a period, with mild cramping for one day. I didn't have to take any painkillers, and was able to go about my normal daily routine. I took a blood test a week after my first dose of misoprostol and it showed that I was no longer pregnant.

My case is pretty rare. I think most wait a couple weeks more than I did to have the abortion. From the time I found out I was pregnant to the time I found out I was no longer pregnant was 12 days. 

I feel relieved and I am confident that I made the right decision. I'm still a bit emotionally up and down, but I'm ultimately glad that I did it. Thanks so much to everyone who left comments and advice. Your support was really encouraging.
