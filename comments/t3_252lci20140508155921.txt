Yea, so I'm not sure how you go about that without making it a private sub and if that happens, how do you decide who get's invited?  How will the content/atmosphere match with your expectations?  I'm pretty sure I (posting for several years to 2X) wouldn't get in.  

Now that the whole world has been let in, trying to keep people from following to those new subs would get really pretty difficult.

2X benefited from relative anonymity before... That will be damn hard to recreate in the future.
