i can't speak for all men. i can only speak for me. but i can say that men and women have completely different ways of forming attraction, and are attracted to different traits (otherwise we would see a massive social push for everyone to be androgynous). the studies i have seen suggest that women have more mailable modes of attraction than men do. and that men are more likely to be hung up on physical characteristics than women are. 

studies done on male sexual attraction show that it is not as plastic (changable) as female sexual attraction. i would venture to say that your male friends either developed a fetish, or simply lowered their standards (and still would desire what they desired when younger) and have become comfortable with new norms. 

as for wider hips, this seems to be a universal trait shared by males. there has been multiple studies confirming the golden ratio in attraction with many lines of symmetry, one is the hips to waist ratio. this is not cultural, and even infants display preference to this ratio.
