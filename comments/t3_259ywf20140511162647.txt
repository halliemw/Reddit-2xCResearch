Ah. Thanks for pointing that out. I'd still ask, though, as it's tremendously rude to send a save-the-date plus invite someone to your shower and then not invite the person to your wedding - so I'd operate on the assumption that the invite was lost. If the bride actually was incredibly rude and will then be on the spot for an awkward explanation, tough shit, that's what happens when you're rude.
