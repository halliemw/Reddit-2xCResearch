I'm sorry. I can understand how you feel. I can have a hard time having an orgasm, and almost getting there, and then not, is always awful. I found it helpful for me to practice having argasms when I was alone. It helped me learn my body and get comfortable with it. I found that using vibrators could make it harder for me to have an orgasm from PIV. 

I don't think you should be embarrassed that you start crying. It seems like a reasonable reaction.
