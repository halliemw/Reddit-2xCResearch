>  The fact is that if she wouldn't have placed herself in such a vulnerable situation to begin with she wouldn't have had that experience.

Can you provide an exact list of every single situation, every single day of life where a woman is 'highly likely to be raped.'  Maybe we can learn to avoid them?

In her own home?  At a friend's house?  On the job?  Walking to the bus stop?  Going to the store?  Babysitting for someone?  Jogging in the park?  Walking the dog?  Just being a woman?  I could go on.

I'm hoping you can provide a list of "situations" women should avoid!
