it's horrifying that a father could look at his daughter and, instead of saying "my daughter was *raped*, and is clearly not ready to care for a child", and instead says "you're killing my grandchild." bastards like that *don't even deserve grandchildren.*  
if you can't provide sympathy to your OWN CHILD when they were TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, you don't deserve the affections of a grandchild.
