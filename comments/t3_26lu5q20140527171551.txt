>  A few simple changes to make a long term difference

Right, if you actually did want to make a change, this is absolutely the way to do it.. but to me you sound like you have a pretty healthy attitude towards food and your body already! Often when I go out for meals with friends a couple of them will try and talk themselves into having a chicken salad, it's just sad to watch, especially as I'm tucking into my steak and fries with extra onion rings..
