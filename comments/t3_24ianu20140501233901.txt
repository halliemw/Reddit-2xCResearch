I just flip them the bird and continue on my way. I guess I don't give catcallers any more consideration than I do some turd that cuts me off when I'm driving. Flip the bird to indicate my disapproval (I'm a Detroit driver, it's how I roll), move on with my life. 


Now if someone gets weird and starts following me, then I'll get on my phone and call the police. I've never had to do that though.
