It was, but not because I was conflicted about the abortion. I had no questions that the abortion was the right thing to do, and I bear no emotional scars from that decision. Unfortunately, the attitudes of people around me and the political climate of the time conspired to make it a highly unpleasant experience. The only thing I regret is that I didn't dump that abusive asshole the moment he started piling on the guilt.
