Get a new doctor. I wanted an IUD and have tried to have on inserted twice now. the second doctor who tried did an ultrasound to measure the size of my uterus... turns out it is just a tad too small for the IUD. I share that to tell you there are things a doc can do you help you find out if an IUD is a good choice for you. 


I ende up complaining about low labido to my gyno as well. Because an IUD is not an option.she gave me testsateron cream to help. 

Bottom line get a doc who cares listen and help.
