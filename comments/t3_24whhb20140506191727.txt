Talk to him about what the abortion means to him.  Not finances or lifestyle or career.  What does it mean to him personally.  I think you will find that he feels rejected.  Like his baby isn't good enough for you.  Not important enough.  That it means you don't love him enough.

Irrational, but feelings are feelings.  So deal with them.  Assure him that you definitely want his children, and only his children, but this is not the right way.  You didn't know you were going to get pregnant.  You weren't taking special vitamins or avoiding certain hazards.  You were taking a daily hormone pill for heaven's sake!  That these are risks.  (Maybe not big risks, but certainly not ideal.)

Maybe that will help.
