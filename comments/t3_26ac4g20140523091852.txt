>If that was actually the case then why would employers hire men at all?


Teachers, nurses, waiters, social workers, etc tend to be women. Tedious, hard jobs that aren't being compensated nicely enough. Chinese factories where your phone was built - quite a lot of poor women work there as well. Your t-shirt and other clothes - most likely were made in the third-world country by women who have minimum wages so you could pay less for your stuff. But no, it's easier to close your eyes, cover your ears and say "lalalala these problems aren't real, lalalala can't hear you over the sound of my privilege".
