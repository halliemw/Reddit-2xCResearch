My fiance pointed out recently that a stay-at-home girlfriend/wife (or boyfriend/husband) does contribute indirectly to the working partner's financial earning as well. At the end of a long day at work, the last thing he wants to do is take care of grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning or laundry. Being able to come home to a well running household decreases his stress levels and lets him relax more, which contributes to better mood and productivity when he is at work.

Right now both of us are working, but all that added financial income doesn't change the way our house is a mess and we end up eating out a lot.
