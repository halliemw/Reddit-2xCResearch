The lack of moral and ethic here is so ludicrous, that I don't even know where to start from.  FIRST, it reaffirms that it is indeed an injustice if men don't get women.  SECOND,  it claims that it prevents societal violence (by what, getting men laid?), thus stating that if men don't get laid society is in danger. It obviously assumes that men eventually won't be able to control themselves and we would be all in danger. Ok, I might be going a bit slippery slope here but whatever, the nerve that this people have to even imply that!  THIRD, it is capitalizing on the tragedy.  Seriously, what's not to love here?

I will say what I have been saying for years.  The first stage in justifying violence and attacks against a group is first objectifying that group and those denying the connection of the this crime with misogyny is, at best, being (or pretending to be) obtuse.
