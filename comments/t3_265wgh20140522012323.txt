This is so offensive and appalling on so many levels, it made my brain malfunction for a second. I don't even know if I'm saying the right thing here, but my gut feeling is that the professor *must* know about it.  Since the student didn't take a picture of the dean's ass, I feel that taking it directly to the dean is a bit disrespectful to the professor, maybe even a  little dismissive of her own authority and ability to deal with situations like these.  She is, after all an adult, a professional, and the person against whom this distasteful and totally unethical act was committed.  I think that not only she deserves to know, but she also deserves to be the person who decides how she wishes to proceed.  I'm not against the dean being involved, and I'm pretty sure he (or she) eventually would be involved.  I just think the decision should come from the professor.  

On a personal note, this post just blew my mind.   I don't know if I'm just lucky in this regard, but most of the professors I have encountered in my academic life were so very encouraging and kind towards me, that I can't help but having a soft spot and the utmost respect for them. Some have been a definite positive presence in my life as educators, mentors and there are a few that  I even *almost* call friends.   This level of disrespect to a professor is truly unnerving.
