Generally when I make changes to my hair or I am actively losing weight, I see my "goals" as improvements. I don't think they were dissing your previous looks, but they may have assumed that you were actively changing your appearance and were encouraging you along the way.

I weighed 185 lbs at my worst- during my stint in retail I started dropping the weight. One of the security guards (who didn't know me too well) did not realize that I was trying to drop the extra poundage. Forty pounds down he asked... "What happened? Are you sick?"
