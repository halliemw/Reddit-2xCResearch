I've been in this situation and since it seems like you don't want to lose her as a friend, what happens next is mostly up to your friend. Either she will be capable of continuing a strictly platonic relationship, or she won't.

Explaining that you don't return her feelings, but would like to remain friends is about all you can do.

Don't lose hope. I've known for a few years that my gay friend was attracted to me and it hasn't really impacted our friendship that much. They know I'm not into them that way.
