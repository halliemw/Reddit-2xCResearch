I haven't baked anything, but I have tried talking to them about things they seem to like. They love talking about that stuff. It's when it comes to ME that they don't care and automatically have a negative attitude. They love themselves, but me, not at all. I don't want to look for a new job, so I'm trying to just be professional but still nice, yet keep them at a distance
