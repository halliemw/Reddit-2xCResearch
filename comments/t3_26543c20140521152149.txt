Ah, but it ISN'T just a joke. You feel disrespected and belittled because it's a power play dressed up as a joke. A joke is shared; he's not sharing jack shit, he's pushing your boundaries because it makes him feel like a big alfalfa male. I doubt he'd find it funny if you were to turn around and kick him in the sack in response. Maybe you should tell him as much.
