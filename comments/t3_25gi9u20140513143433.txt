>Also, do people not realize how much of a pain in the ass it is to pump for 20-30 minutes before going out

Probably not. I had no younger siblings and haven't had kids yet myself, so I'm still learning lots about breastfeeding. I am all for breastfeeding being allowed in public, however, I think it's also important for parents to realise that people aren't born with knowledge of what new parents go through, and to educate rather than preach/swear at people that don't understand.
