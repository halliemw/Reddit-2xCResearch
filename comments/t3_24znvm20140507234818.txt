That's horrible and I'm sorry it's happened to you.  Since I posted my first comment on this thread I've gotten a bunch more shitty messages.  

I don't understand how the mods are going to regulate this sub in such a way that will keep the shitty pm's away.  While I want everyone to find out about the greatness of this sub, I don't feel like the masses can be trusted.
