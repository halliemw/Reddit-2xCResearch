Not sure I'd go with pepper spray, but an air horn should freak out anyone who's trying to be creepy without drawing attention to themselves. And they should be legal to carry anywhere. Something like [this](http://www.partysuppliesnow.com.au/view-product/Birthday-Parties/60/479/Party-Air-horn?gclid=CMHymb-GvL4CFRMDvAod-1IA4w) would be pretty easy to fit into a bag.
