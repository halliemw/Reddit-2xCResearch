I think the real point is that there is very real confusion over this stuff.

Feminism has brandished alcohol as basically being a "consent remover" - with the right spirit, but a lack of forethought.

The people saying that "drunk sex is rape" get this notion for poorly explained and distributed notions of sexual assault, and the logical conclusion of "you can't consent while drunk."  I think the author's tone is overly judgmental and totally dismissive of the idea that people think this way (it's isn't a "lie" being perpetrated, it's a humongous cultural game of telephone). 

Feminism now needs to deal with the repercussions of their inherently flawed assertions.  I don't blame them for the initial assertions, but instead of rising to defend them time and again and brand conservatives and alleged "rape apologists" as the enemy.

I was in the orientation team in my college, and when the incoming frosh were being shown the sexual assault awareness portion, the biggest question (it got repeated, several times!) was "How do I know if I'm raping someone?"

"How do I know if I'm raping someone?"

These people aren't idiots - it's just that Patriarchy has developed Rules of Engagement for these things that promote male privilege while silencing female voices, and now, as we try to undo these things, these men are having to challenge very deep-seated perspectives on how sex and sexuality function in society at large.
