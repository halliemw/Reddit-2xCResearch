Life shouldn't be this complicated for a 13 year old :( But it seems there is no option but to motor on. 

I think fault also lies with me, for underestimating my level of involvement in her life. I have been promoted from a cool uncle to a father and here I am thinking that I am still that cool uncle. I need to step up.

I will keep your suggestions in mind and make sure she has all the support she needs. Thank you.
