Yeah, if you work for a large company, they *have* to have procedures for this. I would ask HR and ask your supervisor what the procedures are for responding to sexual comments from callers. 

If they don't help you, then you will have to come up with something. For the pet namers, I would just ignore it if it's a "honey" or "dear" (I'm from the South. Some of us just talk that way!), but if it's something more salacious, say, "Sir, please refer to me as Karen." 

For the ones that get personal, just say, "I'm sorry, sir, but that is not appropriate conversation. Is there anything more I can help you with regarding your account?" These things are much more in *how* you say them than what you say. Don't scold them. Just be completely matter-of-fact. Pretend you literally are a call-center robot...or Siri.
