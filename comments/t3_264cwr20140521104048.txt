Oh wow. I married a guy like this. He didn't talk about boning other women but made critical remarks about their bodies. Other than that he said the same things your bf says regarding how women should behave.

I am so fucking stupid. I always thought he was kidding and was being sardonic regarding people who think this way because what moron would speak in this way otherwise? Especially to me? It was the smile that did it.

Listen to me. He's not kidding. He believes this shit and doesn't care what you think about it or how it makes you feel. Whatever choices you make regarding your relationship know this: He truly believes the things he's saying.
