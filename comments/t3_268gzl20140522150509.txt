I feel the same way. I already have bad cramps and bleeding, although it is usually just one day of terrible pain like you and the rest is bearable. Can anyone tell me/us if the pain lasts longer with the Paraguard or if it is just more intense for a similar length of time?

As for the cost, I am waiting to hear back from my OBGYN on what my insurance copay will be. I've heard pretty varying stories.
