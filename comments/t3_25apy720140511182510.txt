That's not necessarily true. The detrusor muscle, responsible for the contraction that causes you to pee, is made up of smooth muscle. If it's weak, you'll pee more often.  
There's also the internal and external urethral sphincter (although the internal isn't a true sphincter) and those enable your bladder to fill by contracting. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle.  
Yes, it can totally be a nervous system thing too. The hypogastric nerve is responsible for stimulating beta1-adrenoceptors and alpha1-adrenoceptors to allow your bladder to fill while stimulation of the pudendal nerve results in actual micturition. However, saying that it has nothing to do with the muscles is false.
