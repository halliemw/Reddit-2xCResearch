Be careful of offers for things like trade work for rent. It sounds rather enticing but is almost always either heavily weighted in their favor (you would need to work WAY too much), or its something along the lines of them wanting to see you naked. I went to one place where the bathroom had no walls and the owner of the house was a strange man in his 60s who only had very young female foreign exchange students living there. His trade was reduced rent for the ability to watch them shower. He also had a no male guests policy. 
Sometimes it's as subtle as having cameras placed throughout the house. 

All in all, just trust your gut. Go interview before accepting if that is a possibility and if not ask if you can skype with them. Try to find a house full of people your own age.
