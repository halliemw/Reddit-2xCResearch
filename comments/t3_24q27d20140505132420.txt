Thanks :) I read your update and it sounds like you had a really eye opening discussion with him. It sounds like he sees that that is controlling behavior and admits it comes from jealousy which he is willing to work on. Your compromise sounds reasonable. I'd certainly watch out for old patterns, but it sounds like you got to a good point. My ex just denied it when I brought it up so they differ there. Sounds like your boyfriend genuinely is upset he treat you that way and will work on it. I'm happy your conversation went well, sounds like he learned something :)
