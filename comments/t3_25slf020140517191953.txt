I know that they still have high standards for appearance for guys at certain restaurants/pubs/bars, but it really annoys me that those standards never include impractical clothing that actually makes your job harder. Like, oh, I can't get a raise because my timing isn't as good as my male coworker's? It takes him thirty seconds to plate and deliver the entrees, but it takes me forty five? Well I'd like to see him do it in forty five seconds wearing stilettos.

I once worked at a catering company and when I was working in the back I could wear whatever I wanted, but when serving or bussing I would have to wear high heels. I could be working as long as thirteen hours if we were doing an all-day event.
