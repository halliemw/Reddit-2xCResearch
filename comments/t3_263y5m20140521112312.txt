Having a dedicated clinic that ONLY deals with providing medical/psychological treatment for FGM is important because clinicians likely receive no medical training regarding the matter in medical school. Therefore, this center will be staffed with therapists who understand the socio-cultural roots of FGM as well as gynecologists who have been trained in medical/surgical approaches for correcting and treating complications from the deformations caused by FGM. 

There is not currently much education/resources for primary care Drs in dealing with FGM and it is not a population that should be the focus of experimental treatment.
