One reason I posted this is that in the last month I came to this same realization. Gender-queer really does define my situation well and I am still reading to learn more about it.  It is new to me too :).  In our modern world I want all people to fee loved and welcomed and for some that may be gender issues, for me it is.  I feel pinned down by 'what a man should act like or do'  I'm and 30 years old and still to this day when I tell people my favorite color in my youth was hot pink they laugh in my face and some tell me I must be gay, quite a strong reaction to a color.  I find it so fascinating as well.
