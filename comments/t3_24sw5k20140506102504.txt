That he is meaningless is definitely the goal. It is certainly how he has made me feel and it is horrible. He really has made it completely clear that I mean and meant nothing to him. And while I doubt he would care if I did the same to him that is absolutely the goal. Right now he stabbed me in the back and keeps twisting the knife. I would love to get to the point where none of these effected me- where his actions mean nothing and he can't hurt me anymore. I think that will take a long time. And maybe in the meantime I can fake it till I make it. :) I have already committed to no longer speaking with him. I said my piece yesterday. I got it out of my system and allowed myself one day of vindictiveness where what I said was aimed to hurt. Now my goal is to move on with grace. 

And as far as assholes ending up together his new girlfriend certainly seems to fit the bill. She did the same thing to her long term boyfriend but moved my ex into their house first. I hope that the fall to the bottom hurts. (With the goal of me not even caring about this of course :) )
