It does say on the FAQ that all are welcome here but you wouldn't know it from the posts like "not all men" and "mansplaining" making it to the front page from here. Feminists are very hostile towards men in TwoX. Please don't let that discourage you from participating in the discussions, we need all perspectives in here otherwise this place will just become a circlejerk for extremist feminists and devolve into Tumblr 2.0.
