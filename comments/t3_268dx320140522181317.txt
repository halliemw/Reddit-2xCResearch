This is just what I needed today! I am a physical therapist assistant at a skilled nursing facility, I'm 25, petite; I consider myself to be a good looking lady. This one patient that I work with harrasses all of the female staff members. Some examples of comments that were directed to me JUST TODAY were: "You pretty little thing, you." "I could help you make a baby." "I like watching you walk from behind." "You have a very nice rear end." Dude. You could be my GRANDFATHER. My quick responses of "That is not appropriate for therapy, please keep your comments to yourself" have been ignored by said patient. He is relentless. My boss knows, I've requested that he only works with male therapists. I now feel so much better about being assertive with his comments. I am a therapist and human being, I should be respected as such.
