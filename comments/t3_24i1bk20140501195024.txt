It is important to consider that *when* you get scarring, never mind the risk of keloid occurrence for just a moment, it is going to be visible due to location. As with any surgical procedure, even something as commonplace as mole removal, there are risks beyond scarring, including infection, reappearance, and so on.

IANAD, this is not medical advise, and so on, but, are you prone to keloid scarring? If you've suffered keloid scarring in the past, it is generally not advisable to remove noncancerous lesions, I believe.

Your existing scars should give you some insight whether or not you are prone to this particular type of scarring.

[This seems to be a fairly sane source](http://westlakeplasticsurgery.com/articles/moles-lesions-making-a-mountain-out-of-a-molehill/) on the likelihood of complications including hypertrophic and/or keloid scarring risks, as well as some general advice such as seeking an experienced surgeon.

Edit: Also I think you look lovely. I don't find moles gross or "old" or w/e, I think they're just another thing that makes every single body unique and interesting. :)
