I definitely understand the irritation of having special or "date" plans change at the last minute, but maybe he was kist trying to be nice to his dad. I know my parents sometimes have had a hard time as I get older and no longer want to "hang out" with them. Maybe his dad really wanted to go and your boyfriend felt that he'd be doing a nice thing for him by inviting him to the movie. If I were in that situation, I know it'd make my dad feel very happy to be included, especially if we were seeing something he really wanted to see. 

In the grand scheme of things, it would seem like a small price to pay to make another person happy. Maybe he'd make it up to you later with something else special and one on one.
