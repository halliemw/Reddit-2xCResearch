>I feel like I'm never going to find anyone who measures up to my ex.

Just wanted to make the point that if you're looking for someone who can 'measure up' to your ex, you'll set yourself up for failure. Not saying go for a mediocre guy, just recognize that everyone will have different strengths. 

That being said, obviously this new guy is a complete scumbag so at least you avoided one asshat.
