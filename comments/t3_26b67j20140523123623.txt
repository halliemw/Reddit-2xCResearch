I wear my wedding ring, but I don't really notice whether other women wear theirs or not. 

I know my mom doesn't because hers broke a while back and she hasn't had it fixed yet. 

My bestie can't wear hers at work and sometimes forgets to put it back on, so at any given time she may or may not be wearing it.
