I know full well how hard it is not to take it to heart once people who have the opportunity to post anonymously think they have a chance to hurt somebody to make themselves feel better.

I really hope the positive outweighed the negative in that regard when it came to responses.

Your story was really inspiring and I was happy to hear about how it turned out, with the groom even apologizing and calling him on the spot.

Anyway humans will be humans. When they have no way of relating to a person and humanizing them (and face no consequences) they have no problem being cruel for their benefit. I'm sorry that that happened, and if this continues to be the case for the subreddit I'd be all for it being back off of default. No one should be subjected to that kind of harassment when they're looking for help.
