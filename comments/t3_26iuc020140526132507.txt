There is evidence that too much time in daycare is detrimental to children  - particularly in their first year. Babies require secure attachments from familiar caregivers who have the resources to be responsive to their needs and provide reassurance and comfort. This often can't happen in daycare where there are usually at least two or three babies to each daycare worker - often many more and you have a high staff turnover.  

Lots of kids do go into daycare in their first year and most come out fine but it's certainly not the ideal in terms of child development. It's a shame that most people no longer have an extended family on their doorstep to help with childcare and that careers are not more flexible to allow mothers and fathers to share the burden of care while both maintaining a career. (NB these kind of options would probably be great for child free people who have important commitments outside of their work too).
In Germany as well as one year paid maternity leave there is the further option to have your job on hold (unpaid) for a further three (I think) years which would be wonderful for those who could afford it. 

I don't think one parent sacrificing or severely damaging their career is a great option but neither is leaving babies in often overcrowded daycares. 
It's a difficult problem that too often receives a blanket response of "oh just put them in daycare" or "well give up your career and be a mother" neither of which is satisfactory (not to me anyway).
