Unfortunately when you catch on that someone is being abused like this, you want to rush in and find a way to help them escape. The problem is that person most likely won't leave that situation based on anything you can do. Ultimately it's going to come down to that person making their own decision to leave. And any effort made to help them will most likely fall back on the person being abused.
