This is where the "teach people not to rape" campaign comes into it's own. I hear so many "this is so dumb, everyone knows not to rape" comments, but then you hear people saying "that's not *really* rape". 


Studies have shown that 4% of college aged men admitted to just under an average of 6 rapes each - SO LONG AS YOU DIDN'T CALL IT RAPE. I've had conversations on here with a guy who couldn't understand why a girl hadn't called him after he raped her. He told the whole story of how he gave her mushrooms and had to carry her to a bathroom so he could fuck her, then carried her back out, why hadn't she called him?? He then got very angry when it was pointed out that she hadn't called him because he raped her.
