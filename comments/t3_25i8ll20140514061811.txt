I just wanted to add: please find out if you have any history of blod clots in the family. Sadly I did not do this and ended up with a chest full of blood clots. Usually the consensus is that the risk for blood clots is so minimal that it's "worth it" for the pregnancy protection, however this is NOT the case if you have a family history of blood clots.

Just a friendly nudge to check up before you swallow down :)
