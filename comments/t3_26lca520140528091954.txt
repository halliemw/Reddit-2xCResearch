She deleted the part that I thought sounded crazy.

I clearly said I agreed with everything except that one part I thought sounded crazy.  Which apparently I should have quoted.

I said I had the complete opposite sentiment as the douche bag in which she was posting about.  Which I do.

"you know whats worse than a loose pussy, a dirty smelly bitch ha thats what"
"if a girl dont know how to get down in bed, dont expect a second call #hoe"

I don't see how disliking the person makes me an "angry "nice guy""  Rather, I think most people would find that person extremely objectionable.
