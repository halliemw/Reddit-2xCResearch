I didn't because at the time, I hadn't paid off my warrant yet (was waiting on my paycheck) I ended up paying it off about a week later and at that point, I felt it was too late to report this incident. Now it is probably most definitely too late but I do remember what he looks like and the name he gave me (which is probably a fake) and based on what he said, he sounds like he works out regularly at that park.
