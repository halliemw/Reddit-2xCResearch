I find it hard to be upset that someone was objectified on Tinder.  It's an app for finding people for casual sex.  It works by showing you a picture of someone, and then you decide whether you'd have sex with them solely based on looks, and you accept/reject them.  If you use the app, you're objectifying people (unless you're conducting a social experiment or something).
