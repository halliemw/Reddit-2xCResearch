From years of personal experience using the pill and no other method with my partner, I never had a pregnancy scare. My vote would be to continue using the pill and not bothering with pulling out in addition. If you and your partner are monogamous and also test negative for any possible STDs, using a condom is definitely unnecessary.

As far as I know, BC pill effectiveness doesn't decrease or increase over time.
