I just got off the pill after nine years on and I didn't think it would make a big difference but it did. You don't realize what something is doing when you 've been with it for so long. My appetite has changed,
 my depression, my sex drive . I don't know for sure if that was all because I'm off hormones but I know I'm happier now than I was.
