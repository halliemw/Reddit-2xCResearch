My first little one is almost 12 weeks and I am loving it. We keep some powdered formula in the house for days when she just can't seem to get enough. The extra bit of food makes her happy and she only gets one bottle of it. For every other feeding, she's on my boobs. We've had some pains here and there, but I wouldn't trade that time with her for anything.
