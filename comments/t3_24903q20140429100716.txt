I'll try that during my next visit, thanks! Loestrin does have a few other generics, apparently, so if nothing else, I'll see about trying one of those. My side effects aren't terrible or anything, more like minor to major annoyances: lethargy, low libido, cramps, recently acne though I was clear-skinned for a couple years when I first switched, etc.
