I do understand how you might feel that way, but it doesn't make you any less of a woman. There are plenty of reasons a woman might not have periods; maybe she has a chromosomal abnormality, maybe she's trans, maybe she has an eating disorder or had a hysterectomy or dozens of other things. But we're all still women. <3
