I feel like a big problem with the issue of women's pay comes from the structures that determine pay in most companies. 

This is going to be a big sweeping generalization, but if a company is making job offers to a position, then they are going to be willing to offer X amount. Realistically though, there is range they are willing to spend on this employee, and they are going to offer the lowest price initially and then negotiate. This is sort of the same as an existing position, wherein the company is willing to make the same raises presented annually (or whatever they do) but will likely have a range that can be negotiated to keep that employee. 

The problem is, women don't negotiate like men do. I can't explain it, but as someone who's done hiring for a company, I've seen it in action. When I hired entry level jobs, applications from women would ask for  minimum wage or leave the rate space empty. Men would ask for even just fifty cents to a dollar over minimum wage and they would get it. Simply because they asked. At the same job I was told that I was the highest paid woman there (and therefore to not share that information) because no one else asked for more money. I had the least experience and I was being paid the most because the other women in my tier refused to request a raise. 

I can't speak for other people's jobs or what a company's policy is. Certainly there are more factors to be considered than just job title and their paycheck. Is it worth negotiating salary? Every time the answer is yes. I will say that it's probably not a great idea to say "he gets paid this much, so I want to as well." That's not just unprofessional, that's accusatory. But it's always worth speaking up and being assertive about insisting you get paid what you're worth. Even if that means leveraging another job offer to do it.
