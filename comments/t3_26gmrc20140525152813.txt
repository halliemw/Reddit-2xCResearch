If you work for a chain restaurant call HR and let them know a customer is harassing female workers on a daily basis and that the managers are not doing anything to stop him. If I were you I would tell anyone he comes in contact with to record the event on paper or with their phone or whatever they can. I'd get your coworkers to pile your evidence together and tell the mangers there will be consequences (Like going to higher management) if they don't get their act together. I would also get the make and model of his car and license plate number. You know his name, get his phone number too, and call the police. Tell them you have a customer that comes in and harasses the workers that you feel he may escalate and if they wouldn't mind just to do a drive by or come in once in a while maybe even talk to the managers. Honestly if you feel Glen will escalate then go to the police as soon as possible. If he is making drinks (from how is sounds he doesn't work there) they can have him thrown out and not allowed back in.
