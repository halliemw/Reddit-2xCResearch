The FAS changes things a bit. I would maybe give her parents a heads up that she's considering having sex and maybe work with a counselor to figure out how to best approach the issue. Also, make sure she knows the importance of safer sex practices. Due to her impulse control issues, there's likely not a lot you can do to prevent her from having sex (short of shipping her off to a nunnery,) so make sure you're doing damage control at the same time. Keep the lines of communication open.
