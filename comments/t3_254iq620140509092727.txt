In high school, I once tripped during a band concert while carrying my tuba (which was nearly as tall as me) right in the front of the stage (I was stepping up to the stage from a riser. Big step. Short person). It wasn't too embarrassing. :)

But yeah, I chose flats all the way!! And I've been practicing walking in them.
