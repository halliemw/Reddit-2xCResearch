> Pity the Cheerleaders: They're pretty, perfectly proportioned and popular.

I don't think this has much to do with them being pretty. 

I think generally people with "real" jobs look on people with "fun" jobs with disdain and don't care if they get compensated or not.  A lot of the same problems exist when it comes to comedians, artists, or musicians.  I do comedy and there is a huge problem in the stand-up comedy world with clubs not paying comics, even if they are charging an admission fee.
