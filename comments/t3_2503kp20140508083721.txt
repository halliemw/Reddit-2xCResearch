Thank you SO much for those who have commented... My focus aside from my own feelings is to primarily help her.  I did express that I'm having my disappointment and initial anger, but I know I'm on the right path that as I soaked this in, the most important thing is being a trusted person in a horrible time in her life.  Like I said, I told her "Well get through this together" is my focus aside from my feelings.  I also did tell her that I did need to work through my own initial feelings, and wrote that after a four hour ordeal with that news while breaking down, getting towed and a taxi.... but the ultimate goal is making sure she can cope. 

I thank you all for your points of view and advice... extremely helpful.  Definitely helps me keep in perspective this really is about her and nothing and nobody else, and to do what's best and right for her. 

Definitely, as some have suggested, this certainly presents an opportunity in finding a reliable method of BC that works with her hormones.  Hopefully she's open to the thought of an IUD but we shall see.

Thank you, again!
