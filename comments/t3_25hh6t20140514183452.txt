> A huge pet peeve of mine here is as a mental health professional, I think sometimes commenters are doing more harm than good, albeit unknowingly. Some of the "how should I feel" sort of posts quickly escalate into making a woman feel like she was seriously violated or abused when in reality, if she didn't feel like that before all people are doing is unnecessarily traumatizing that person.

I very much agree with this point and would even extend it.  I think this sub can easily become a damaging echo chamber of whining and external blame.  I think people mistakenly think that removing blame from a woman is effective support.  Sometimes the best support is to carefully and sensitively point out where someone participated in the negative situations.  (I am NOT talking about assault or rape or anything like that, I am talking about things like weepy break-ups and friend/work-place drama.)  Somehow the worst for me are when people come on her to complain about how self-centered and unreasonably a friend who is in a stressful but temporary situation (often preparing her wedding) is behaving. And then I see a thread full of advice about how OP needs to put her foot down with the friend, talk it out, or cut her out of her life because she is toxic.  I feel like 2XC has become for friendships and family what /r/relationships has become for romance.  All about dumping who every you are with because anything less then perfect, maybe not all that bad on its own, is a "huge red flag."  It's like the whole logical fallacy that pot is bad because it's a "gateway drug."  Whoa, this is getting long and off track.  Suffice to say, I feel 2XC has gone from a productively supportive community to one that is destructive.
