It bothers me how so many men tell us to constantly be on the look out for creepy men to avoid becoming a victim, yet when we do, they claim we're overreacting. 

It doesn't matter if *you* aren't creepy, when every man has the potential to be creepy, then you're going to be viewed with caution until we know you aren't a threat. I know it sucks for many men to know this, but guess what,  we don't like it either. It sucks that many if us can't relax or feel at ease around strangers that are men like we can with fellow women.

Sorry if this is all over the place. Wrote on my shitty phone.
