In the posters it showed the moms pulling their tops down to nurse.  I found it much easier to pull my top up, from the bottom.  This made it easier to keep the cloth away from my kid's face, and also covered up my breast...much more discrete than pulling the blouse down.  I also want to say that I extended nursed all four of my children.  I traveled on business extensively and always took my kids along.  I nursed my children anywhere we happened to be when they got hungry.  I even tandem nursed a toddler and a new born.  And I never, ever got flack for it.  Not once.
