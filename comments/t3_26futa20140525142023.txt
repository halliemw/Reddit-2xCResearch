Mormolyke isn't trying to stigmatize mental illness. I mean the shooter's parents already warned the police about his dangerous behavior, as he had been seen by multiple therapists.

It's true that stigmatization of the mentally ill is an issue, but I don't think Mormolyke was trying to say "oh he was crazy, thus this is okay, par for course, stay away from crazy people!"
