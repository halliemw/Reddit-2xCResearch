Don't worry too much about it.  Several men gave me great advice on raising a daughter, and it's more common sense than you realize.

Be strict parent when you need to be, and a loving father every other time.  She should not be specifically a "daughter" to you.  Just your child.  This way of thinking is especially helpful when you have a boy and a girl.  Don't treat them any differently just because of gender.

Kids love to know their parent's interests.  So let them participate in some of the things you enjoy.  My 3 year old girl is loving Hot Wheels, and I just bought her a modular track to race them on.  She loves it, and I get to spend time with her racing little die-cast cars.

Just be the best, loving parent you can be.
