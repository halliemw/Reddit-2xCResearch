It you are talking about trying to find larger sizes I like Lane Bryant or Torrid when I can get them on sale. Sometimes Fredrick's. However you can try Ross, Walmart, and Fashion Bug (if they still exist.) Even with smaller sizes Walmart, Ross, and TJ MAx carry basic undies. Also you guys might want to look into lingerie stores near you. If you are near Atlanta like I am there are plenty of boutiques like Livie Rae. Though personally I don't shop there any more.
