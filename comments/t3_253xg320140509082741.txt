Why not opt to go without attendants at all, and ask some friends to give readings at the wedding and others (or the same ones) just to help you out in the planning process.  Just be careful to plan a wedding you can handle without lots of help and back-up, which can definitely be done.  I have been a maid-of-honor three times, and I worked my ass off, but those weddings did not need to be nearly as elaborate as they were. In every case the problems always stemmed from the mother of the bride, directly or indirectly.  Fulfilling her vision (which the bride may or may not be buying into 100%) and helping the bride deal with the stress of dealing with her mother and fulfilling said vision was the source of all the work and stress.  Without MOB issue, I think you can make things pretty simple.
