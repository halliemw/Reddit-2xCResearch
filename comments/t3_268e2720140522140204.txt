My take: it was a nice thought on the part of the yearbook editors to include students who may have felt ostracized or alone. I don't think there were any teen moms at my high school (although one girl who went to visit grandma for a few months was rumored to be pregnant) so I can't imagine what the school climate is like for them. On the other hand, is it something that should be in the spotlight for better or for worse? I was yearbook editor-in-chief back in the day, and I remember scrambling for cheesy content to fill the pages (and full color is expensive!). At the end of the day, if it really bothers you there is nothing stopping you from tearing out those pages.
