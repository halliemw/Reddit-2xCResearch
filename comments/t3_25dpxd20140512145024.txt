Breathe through it!  I got so dizzy that I about fainted when I got mine in.  It was pretty horrible.  But I also kind of forgot to breathe.

You know how pregnant women learn about Lamaze?  That will help some.  Whether it helps because it actually changes how you feel pain or because it just gives you something else to think about, it will help.  Concentrate on your breathing.  Concentrate on anything *but* the pain.  For me, the intense pain lasted about 5 seconds (and it was *intense*), and then I had cramps all day.  Get through those 5 seconds, and the next 5-10 years will be so much better.
