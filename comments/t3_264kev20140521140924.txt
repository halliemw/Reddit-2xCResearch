This may sound like I'm telling you to toughen up, but I swear I'm not.

I have my own issues from school, I was unpoular for various reasons and had several social hangups that I still haven't completely gotten over.

Coincedentially, I ran into one of the popular jock kids years after high school and he said similar shit. About how the things said to him, and expected of him, and the pressure left him with his own hangups.

The point is, that adolescents get a shitty time of things, and are often left messed up not only because we don't listen to them, but because they keep it to themselves.

I think, instead of trying to eliminate the possibility of someone's feelings getting hurt, if we focused on teaching people to properly express themselves, and share the rotten experiences/feelings they have, we could do a lot better.

No policy is going to be 100% beneficial to everyone. Nor should it. We just need to acknowledge that there will be those on the brunt end of it, and actively help them adjust/handle the extra burden. If that makes sense.
