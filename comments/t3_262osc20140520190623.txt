I'm actually from Texas, but we had our own [obscenity law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_obscenity_statute)!  5th Circuit struck it down in 2008 though.  I wish y'all in Alabama the best with the legal challenges, and in the meantime, continue to purchase toys under the guise of "educational" or "novelty" purposes ;)
