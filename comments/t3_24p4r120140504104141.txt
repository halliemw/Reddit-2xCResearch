You're going to take it one day at a time. If you sit here and dwell on the fact you have x amount of weight to lose and at a rate of y pounds a month it's going to take you z months you're going to get discouraged. Treat every day like a new day and don't worry about tomorrow. Tell yourself, "Today, I'm going to walk one mile." Don't tell yourself, "Holy crap, in 5 months I'm going to have a run a mile! I can hardly even walk a mile! I'll never be able to do that!"

Start small. Give yourself a goal every day. Once that goal is a part of your daily life, add a new one. This is a lifestyle change that you're embarking on - don't forget that.
