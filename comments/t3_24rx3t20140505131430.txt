Hmmm..... It would seem get main issue with the cover was the complete lack of realism of the female character's body. The size of her boobs, hips, and thighs.  The impractical outfit she's wearing for the task at hand .

What got me laughing is sitting right in front of her is a male character with green skin. Because that's totally realistic. 

Super hero comics are fantasy. Pure, unadulterated fantasy.  Nobody in real life can fly,  turn invisible,  or manipulate nature on a whim. People don't have blue skin, wings, claws,  or magic powers. I would almost argue that having a realistic looking woman in such a setting would be clearly out of place.
