The term slut is HUGELY problematic. both because it is solely label women, and that its entire definition is making negative something that shouldn't be. 

   It is difficult to change it because it is a specific subset of women. someone can think they are all pro womens rights, until certain people act in a specific way.
 Often I find men have a double standard using it, in that its usually used to describe the women having sex with anyone but them. Their girlfriend may be wonderful and perfect, but she leaves and starts seeing someone else, then she's a slut.

I think the fact they are using the term slut is the whole point of the shaming, so If you can think that the term 'slut shaming' does not mean 'you are shaming slutty women' but instead "you are shaming women by labelling them sluts' then it does work on some level.
