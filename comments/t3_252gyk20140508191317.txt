I've testified before a grand jury.  It was a little nerve-wracking beforehand, but it turned out to be fine.  As others have said, the big thing is just to remember that you aren't on trial.  Just be truthful and answer the questions as best as you can remember.  And there's nothing wrong with thinking a moment before you speak, if that helps, just concentrate on answering the question.

I'm sure you will be fine.
