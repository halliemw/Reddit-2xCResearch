Violent protesting in order to silence dissent is not acceptable at a university. This was the third such debacle.  Silence and echo chambers are not the friends of an academic community.

If your position is so weak that it can not withstand debate then the marketplace of ideas will sort it out for everyone to see; be it Warren Farrel's or Dr Fiamengo's or anyone else CAFE brings in.

The students behavior is not just an indictment of feminists, but of the university.  It undermines the discussion of ideas which academia is founded upon.  

If I have to attack feminism (or any ideology) a little in order for issues to even be DISCUSSED at a university then that not fault is not on me.  We should all certainly wonder what ideology has basically taught these students to be so antithetical to the very spirit of intellectualism.  This hate was not born in a vacuum.
