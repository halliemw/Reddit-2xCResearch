We have had some art with sexual aspects. My friend, C, does comics about healthcare, and she did a comic about how diabetes can cause erectile dysfunction (which was narrated by an anthropomorphic talking penis). The comic was based more on health than sex, though. It didn't make me uncomfortable, but it isn't something I'd show a little kid, and I'd definitely consider it R-rated. No one else has really displayed anything containing graphic sex acts in it, though.
