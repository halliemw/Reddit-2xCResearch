This is just advice about the pill (the only BC I have experience with), but if most of your symptoms occur around the placebo week you could skip the placebo and go straight into the next active pill. I did that when I was on the pill and managed to completely avoid all cramps and bleeding. I've read that the placebo week is withdrawal bleeding, not a real period, and that there isn't really a reason to have a placebo week except that women in the early days of the pill found the fake period comforting. Obviously I'm not a doctor but I do know that a lot of women skip their placebos with the approval of their doctor.
