Agreed - this reeks of a situation that eveyone involved agreed on in theory, but when the time comes, you realize you weren't as sure.  I think she should go through with it and then accept the very high probability that their relationship is over with no one at fault.  She doesn't want kids any time soon and the guy thought he didn't, but now discovers that he does.  That's a major difference in opinion that's hard to overcome, much less the resentment that both will feel towards each other.
