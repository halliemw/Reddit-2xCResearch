Another anaology I've seen as useful was comparing being hit on to walking through campus where various clubs and groups are standing around with clipboards. The awkwardness and unwantedness of being approached, knowing the person 'just being nice' likely isn't actually interested in you but what they can get from you (a signature, a donation, etc), not knowing how agressive theyll be when you turn them down, etc.
