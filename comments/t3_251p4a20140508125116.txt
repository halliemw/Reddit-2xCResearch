I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not really sure why I should care about what the rest of the subreddit is doing and if the sub is "getting a bad name." That comment strikes me as a bit coercive. I don't claim to speak for everyone in this sub.

In addition, I hardly see what "hate and virtriol" I am advocating. I thought I was having reasonable discussions with other members (both old and new) of this sub about topics brought up by this post. So what if we disagree? The thing I love most about this sub is that people will voice their disagreements and have super cool discussions (shit have you seen them? People here are so effing smart).
