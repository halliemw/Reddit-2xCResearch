> Any of you grow up not knowing your dad?

*raises hand* My dad was abusive and my mom willingly cut ties. She never shit talked him. If she didn't have anything nice to say, she didn't say anything at all. I adore my mother. I was fortunate enough to have a great uncle and grandfather [on my mom's side] so I wouldn't say I missed out on the experience of having a male figure in my life, and I can say without a doubt that my life would be pretty fucked up had my actual dad been involved. 

Your ex isn't creating a loving or fulfilling environment for his child. Instead, she's going to end up with daddy issues. Even further than that, she'll have this irrational fear of people popping in and out of her life and I know that you know she deserves better than that.

I say that if he's willing to give up his rights, then do it. And allow someone else to be the man that he clearly can't be.
