I agree.  Our neighbors turned me in for disturbing the piece after I discovered a camera aimed into our backyard from their side (this was after they also stole from us) and started yelling.  I admitted to yelling (which I probably shouldn't have) but told the police why I was yelling (they already had my complaint on file, they were not happy that I was yelling, but I merely got a warning).

I shouldn't have gotten that warning.  If I had done the same thing within six months, I would have been facing misdemeanor charges.
