Ok, this was 10 years ago, but I pulled together my wedding of 90+ guests for ~$5k.  I found a great inexpensive wedding dress shop, we self-catered, we hired a community centre hall, we had a great photographer who didn't work in digital but still was incredibly professional who even gave us the negatives and everything on a disk as well, we had a limo but I'd have to say one of the things that really helped was that we had a church wedding - for $200, we got the priest, the church and the paperwork we needed (but we are both Catholic and that is what we decided we wanted).  Bridesmaids bought their own dresses, I just made sure they were ones they would be happy to wear again (and they both have!) - feel free to inbox me if you want to ask me any questions about how I cut the budget without making the wedding come across as 'cheap'.
