I'd like to see studies done on the topic, because I'm one of those who feels it doesn't cause weight gain and is just used to push the blame to out of laziness or just not paying attention to your eating/exercising habits. Maybe there has been studies done and I just haven't looked into them yet. But it doesn't make sense for one to eat a little less than daily maintaining calories, exercise, and continue to gain weight. 

*So from just some simple searching it shows that if anything it contributes to fluid retention which causes very little weight gain. So thanks for the down votes of disagreement with lack of evidence on your part.
