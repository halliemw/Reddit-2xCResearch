You don't need to ignore these things, just figure out ways to deal with it.  

Some jobs/companies are going to be worse than others, but I highly doubt every day is going to be as bad as the stories you read.  When those get to much, you really just need to take a step back and refocus.  

I'm the only programmer who also happens to be a woman at the game studio I work in.  Most days are just normal days.  Some days the microagressions get to me.  Then there are the handful of days that are really bad.  

During interviews you can get a feel of how a company is.  How your team is.  What HR is like.  You are interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you.  Ask questions.  Find a place that is a good fit.  

You do also have to understand that you aren't going to change minds overnight.  Sexism is so ingrained in our culture that it's just going to take time.  So you need to navigate it in a way that works best for you.  Will you speak up?  How will you speak up?  How would you deal with it?  These are things best to know *before* something happens.  You also need a safe place to release the feels.  The frustration, anger, sadness, et all.  I go to yoga and I probably wouldn't get through a week without it.  You need to find your thing.
