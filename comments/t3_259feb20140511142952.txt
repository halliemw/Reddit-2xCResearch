The fact that you are so aware and involved is amazing.  

I find a lot of involved dads want to treat their daughters like a princess - and have different rules for their boys. 

My father was very abusive and the only thing I learned from him is unhealthy communication/temper. I have worked very hard to undo this but it's hard. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 

My thoughts on what I wish my dad had done:

Teach me hand on skills. He was a carpenter in his home country and I wish he had shown me some skills.

Talk to me outside of screaming. 

Not beat the hell out of me for not having manners (that were never taught to me).

Taught me manners by practising them. I really believe in doing what you say. I even thank my dog each time she behaves. 

Encouraged me in academics. My father had a grade 5 education and put no value on school. I dropped out of highschool and didn't ever consider college. Again - I worked hard to change it and have graduated college and am enrolled in university part time (college and uni are different in Canada).

Most of all I wish he had shown me love and compassion.  Being a teenager sucks and I was berated for every move I made. My father died when I was 25 - I held his hand when he left - It was important to me to show him the compassion that he never gave me. 

I really can't stress how amazing it is that you want to give your daughter the best upbringing possible.  This space is great for seeing what women encounter - it's not just a place to vent about the negatives but to share in each others happiness. 

Good Luck. Your daughter is very lucky.
