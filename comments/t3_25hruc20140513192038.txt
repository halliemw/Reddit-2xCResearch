I'm turning 29 soon. I would say at most 33% of the ladies I know my age (including girls I went to grade school/high school with) are married. Most girls aren't just unmarried, but totally single. You are definitely not abnormal if you feel that way.

I read recently that the average age of marriage for a Canadian woman is early 30s.
