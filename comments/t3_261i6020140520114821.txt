Skype is a godsend. Also, what my girlfriend and I do is we share a plush doll between us; when we visit each other we bring the plush and leave it with whoever didn't bring it. It's not particularly the height of romance, but it's a sentimental thing that makes both of us feel good.

Basically, what you can't do via physical contact you need to make up for in communication. If you can't do that, you're probably not going to have a great time.
