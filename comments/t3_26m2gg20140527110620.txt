This is the exact type of response I was hoping for-- I feel like you completely understand my position and although I'm not pleased that you are in the same boat, it feels good to not be alone.

I haven't phoned my mother in so long that I can't remember our last conversation.  I do most of my communicating through my father.  I see her on holidays or during times of crisis (my father has poor health due to a lifetime of hard, physical labor).  I would like to get it down to 3x a year as you have.

If you don't mind me asking, how did you finally get to this point of acceptance?
