Curious question that I'm wondering someone can answer. If the professor has tenure can they do anything? (he might not, but I'm still curious)The way tenure is portrayed *everywhere* is that it is a professors immortality and invulnerability. If a professor was being openly sexist like that, could the university do anything?
