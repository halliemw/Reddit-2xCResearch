As a feminist (and a woman, and a friend to women and girls) I think this is absolutely crucial reading. Sexual violence is normalized far more than it ought to be, ie., not at all.

However, as an academic, I think it's a real shame that because women's issues have been so frequently dismissed, we don't really have long-term data on issues like this. Is the normalization of sexual violence *decreasing,* as society puts a focus on women's equality and becomes increasingly open about discourses on sexuality? Or is it *increasing* as media becomes more explicit? It's impossible (and totally useless) to speculate without the data, but I'd really like to see an observable trend.
