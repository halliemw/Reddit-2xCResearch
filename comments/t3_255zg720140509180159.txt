This was one of the things that I thought about until I heard an interview with a daughter whose mother had done this.  Her mother was religious, and as it turned out, the daughter wasn't, and felt bad each time she read one of the letters because she felt like she was failing her mother.  

I'm also worried because I don't want to be an anchor, or a constant reminder of sadness in their lives.  I want to be a good memory.  I really like the idea you mentioned about sharing stories.  That is awesome. 

I have already taken care of the will and everything, so that's good...I'm gonna try and pre-pay the funeral too.  Ugh. 

Thank you for the ideas!
