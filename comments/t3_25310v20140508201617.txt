If it was part of an off the clock little fun event companies throw every year then that seems ok. But as part of your training seems pretty ridiculous. 

I understand companies have standards of dress and grooming to reflect a professional atmosphere but I don't feel like makeup should be mandatory unless you work for something like vogue magazine or something. Just dont dress like a hobo or smell like one. 

Don't get me wrong, I love me some makeup and have a battlestation at the ready but it's my personal choice to use it and it's also a woman's personal choice not to use it too.
