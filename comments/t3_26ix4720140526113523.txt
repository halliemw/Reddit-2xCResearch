You're here looking for encouragement to cheat on your marriage. I'll use you  own word - despicable.
Maybe try putting as much emotional and  physical energy into the relationship with your husband as you do with the potential affair.
A difficult relationship stretch is never all one sided. Maybe your husband  senses that your investing the best part of you in someone else? I would come clean with your husband, commit to fixing it an  suggest you go to couples therapy.

Hard statements, but somebody had to say them.
