I have observed that religion is kind of like the chicken pox - people who get it when they're young usually get over the most dizzying evangelicism and can keep a moderate level of religion for the rest of their lives.  But in people who catch it at adults, mid-life, it's really disruptive and maybe even harmful.

I would have two pieces of advice for your friend.  One is to try telling the husband that she found it in her heart to pray about it, and that God told her that what her husband is doing is wrong.  It's transparent but if he's really deep in the throes of a religious "mania" it might make sense to him.  Would she be willing to "fake it" and go along just enough to try to reel him in?

And here's the "real advice": Secondly, from an outsider's perspective, anything that causes one partner to increasingly disregard the feelings and well-being (financial, physical, or otherwise) of the family is a cause for a serious re-evaluation of the future of the relationship.  It's really hard to recommend that to a close friend who doesn't *want* to lose her committed relationship, but how long can she go on like this?  How will it affect her children to keep them around this man who is not able to make good decisions regarding his family life?  I would say they should try a trial separation, especially if she has family nearby who can take her in for 3-6 months while things either settle down or escalate.
