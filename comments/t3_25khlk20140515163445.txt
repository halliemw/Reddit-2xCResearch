It's wordy-ish enough :)

But yeah, while loudness and the softer approach have their places for both men and women, work is a place where I always appreciate anyone who is diplomatic enough to soft-spokenly get their points in. (Though as an introvert I'm biased.) I also agree it's a trend (and a good one) for men to approach things from that angle as it seems to foster better relations overall in an office when that's the norm. 

But I will also always resent people who call me "loud" because I speak up at all, even though nothing about my personality in public settings is what people would call "loud". Ahem. Unless I'm on whiskey 4 or 5....
