That's the most convoluted interpretation of that result I can imagine.  Did they consider the possibility that wide hipped women may have sex more because they are approached for sex more (as apparently a wide hip/small waist ratio is more sexually attractive at least by today's standards)?  If you're approached more, you have more opportunities to say yes and on average then you're going to say yes more...  Much more straightforward than some subconscious worry about childbirth.  sheesh.

Also why do they not mention hormones?  Maybe hormone levels are correlated with hip size and sexual behavior?
