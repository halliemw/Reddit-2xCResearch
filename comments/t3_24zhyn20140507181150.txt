I think just focus on good parenting in general--like others have said, it's not gender specific. Enrich your child educationally, listen to her and get involved in her interests, etc. But beyond that I would say there are a few things to keep in mind with girls in particular. Seek out forms of media that don't portray girls and women negatively. When you see that and she's old enough to understand, point it out. Everyone in my life denied the need for feminism and basically was convinced that women are equal in our country (USA). Even though it wasn't explicitly taught to me, I grew up feeling less than because of my gender. It's great if you can take your daughter to a female dentist or have a female family friend who is a professor, etc. It's so important to have these role models so young girls can see the possibilities for them. I grew up being told, "Yes, girls, you too can be anything you want to be! You can be President!" and yet they never told the boys this because it was assumed. So this inherently introduces doubt as to what they are saying, like why do *I* need to be told this. Believe me when I tell you that we eventually notice that the "boss" is almost always a man. Make an effort to show her something different or at least point out the inequities.

Also keep in mind body image issues are huge for girls, even as young as elementary school. Praise your daughter for being smart or better yet hard-working, persistent, kind, etc. Let her know she is beautiful once in a while but it should be far from being the primary compliment.
