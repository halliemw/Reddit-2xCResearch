Dude Im in the same boat. At 5'1 187 lbs I was all "Im not even in size 14 clothes (fucking lie thanks to Old Navy and Torrid vanity sizing). I have no health problems and Im less than 200lbs." Then I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. In my head that was a fat person issue. The first sign of a health problem got my ass in gear. When I saw my first "before" picture I knew I shouldnt have waited til I neared 200. 

Ive downloaded My Fitness Pal app and track every single calorie that goes into my mouth. I went from eating probably 3000+ calories to 1500-1700. Some days I do eat as much as 2000 but I keep that VERY rare. I go to the gym and do a minimum of low impact cardio. Meaning I do not use a treadmill, but arc trainers, stationary bikes and ellipticals. I jack that resistance up and work slowly. I also started couch25k today. I can only run for 30 seconds at a time, but its better than the no seconds Ive been doing. 

I will tell you not to watch the scale. Losing weight is 80% diet and 20% exercise. You can lose 50lbs by diet alone. Most people add in exercise to fill in gaps in the skin where fat was. The first week at the gym I gained 4lbs. But three weeks later I was down 7. 

Download the app! Seriously! Also, stop drinking sodas and sweet tea. If you have to have soda, remember to log those empty calories. The more you drink the less food you get. Get a bottle of Deer Park with the sport cap and fill that bitch up 3 times a day to start with. Get used to peeing (perfectly normal and necessary) for a few days.
