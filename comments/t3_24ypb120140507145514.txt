I've never been married, so take this with as much salt as necessary: I was my cousin's MOH, and she told me the best advice she and her husband got was to accept that they weren't going to get every single thing they wanted. Rather, they each picked three things that were crucial to them and, as they were making decisions, made sure to prioritize those items. I don't recall if their things overlapped or not. But she was really happy with the strategy and their wedding was a fucking blast.
