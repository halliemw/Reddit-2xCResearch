I don't have anything to add, but the way you feel is how I felt when I found out WalMart carried $4 scripts for Viagra but NO $4 scripts for birth control. And my insurance made me pay $20 a month for mine but Viagra was 100% covered. I think some of that has changed now but still. The gender bias is SO HUGE
