Same thing happens with r/childfree. I mean, everyone thinks it's full of hate and bigots, but the people there are pretty nice, we just don't wanna breed. r/mensrights gets a bad rep on here, but the majority of people there are just regular guys that're frustrated by the fact that their issues are often ignored. There are assholes in every subreddit, but unless it's r/adviceanimals they're probably not the majority.
