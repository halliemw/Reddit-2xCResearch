So I guess the question is, to what extent are certain words used for certain genders more because people judge the genders differently, and do what extent is it just because people act differently?\*  For something like "bossy" or "pushy", I imagine most people will say that people are judging women more harshly...but do people say that about "condescending" too?  What if it turned out (as I'm sure it would) that men are more likely to be described as "aggressive" or something similar?

\* Also maybe a third possibility that for some actions, there's 2 negative words one for each gender.
