There are a lot of undeniable red flags in this story. You did nothing wrong. Even hitting him was in self defense.  Please don't give this guy a second chance to hurt you. He was abusive, and judging by the fact that his father is an alcoholic, the abuse probably runs in the family. You cannot help him, he needs to choose never to drink to that point for himself.
