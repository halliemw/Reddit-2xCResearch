I thought you pushed Diva Cups in until they didn't go in anymore. How do you know when it's in far enough? For tampons I just put my fingers on the little finger grip spot and stopped when my fingers touched my lady bits. (Which I think is what the box says to do.) Is there anything like this on the Diva Cup?
