> I figure ordering boots online carries with it a risk that they won't fit at all, actually.

Oh, well, yeah, obviously. That's true for all clothes. You can return them though, in most places at least.

My point is that you have something to wear for now, but really, it's a good idea to try and make it better, because steel toes too loose is unsafe, no matter how you put it.

I often have a similar issue with clothes - I am a dude, but with disproportionately wide hips, and so often stores won't have something for my specific set of sizes. So I often have to order online, try, and return. It takes longer, and it sure as hell doesn't support local vendors... but it results in clothes that fit. Professional gear, of course, is that much more of an important issue.

As far as vendor size though... well, if the vendor doesn't think about you (and they don't, if the steel toes they sell are for men only), why should you think about them?
