This is actually an issue that I have been thinking a lot about lately. I am a male medical student entering my final year, and I happened to have two very inspirational female mentors during my training. 

First, while that article was written in a very inflammatory manner, it is actually tapping into a real issue. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2336235/Female-doctors-NHS-tremendous-burden-married-children-want-work-time.html is a less inflammatory article from the UK on the same subject.

I am actually very excited that women are opening up a new set of beliefs that working physicians 80 hours a week for life and having them abandon their families is not acceptable. I am very fortunate that I had two female physician mentors who did manage working reasonable hours to balance time with their families. I am actively pursuing a specialty that will allow me to be more flexible, because I don't want my life to be run by my job. I want to see my children and have a meaningful existence outside of the hospital, and I couldn't care less if I make less money because of that.

Personally, I've always resented the American work ethic that forced both my mother and father to be away from home for much of my childhood. I think it is great that females are breaking into the medical field, and this new focus on balancing family life with work is (in my opinion) a very good thing. I don't have a solution for the problem of needing more doctors, and I imagine part of it will be lowering physician pay, but I'm happy to see the old ways torn down.
