I have PCOS and have been totally without a period for nearly 4 years now. I was originally on a hormonal birth control, but after I stopped having periods, I went off it at one doctor's suggestion to see if they returned, but they didn't. I had an IUD put in two and a half years ago now, and other than some spotty bleeding maybe every few months I have nothing. Also, my husband and I do not use any other form of birth control other than my IUD, and we have never had an issue, despite a very healthy sex life. 

None of my doctors were particularly alarmed, and only one (who I came to hate because she was an IDIOT who didn't take other health issues into consideration when prescribing me something) really thought it worth trying to treat since I'm not at ALL interested in having kids, ever. 

It is perfectly fine for it to vanish entirely *so long as there is no other hormonal issue* or any associated complications from retained lining. I suggest making sure you have a full hormone level check done by an Endocrinologist (NOT AN OBGYN!!!!) to make sure your levels are within normal. Mine are, mostly, and as such the long term complications of this lack of periods is likely not an issue. 

Read up on it, but don't get frightened by how nasty some of the conditions that can cause it sound. Rather, go to a good endocrine specialist, and make sure your system in is shape, then decide if you want to aggressively treat or just ignore it.
