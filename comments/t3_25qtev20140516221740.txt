> in the US or Canada you can't consent to sex when you're drunk

Every state will have a slightly different definition of rape/sexual assault, but in no state that I'm aware of is being slightly drunk alone by default sexual assault.  Usually the victim needs to be so intoxicated that they were either unconscious or unable to physically express nonconsent.
