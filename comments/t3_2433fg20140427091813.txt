Went bed shopping with my husband at one point. I paid for the bed and signed all the paperwork. My husband wasn't involved in any of it and he wasn't even on my credit card.

A month later we get a thank you card: "dear [husband's name], I hope you and your wife enjoy your new bed."

What the fuck?
