>I completely agree, and sometimes I even use it as an apology of sorts. I'm basically saying that I am very happy with the person I am with, and I am rejecting you not because I think you're a creep or unattractive, but because I value the relationship I am in.

The author is talking about something completely different, someone who isn't interested, but uses the boyfriend line because it's the only thing that will sink into a dude's thick skull.
