I was the last girl in my friend group to get my period, and eventually had to go on the pill to regulate it because I would just spot every couple months and my mom was concerned about it being irregular and shit.
Anyway, I was a freshman in high school, 15 I think, and I was in geometry. I thought I felt something weird in my panties, so I went to the bathroom and found out what had happened. I was SO HAPPY. Finally I could be a normal girl! I was so excited, I remember telling a bunch of my girl friends as soon as I got back to class, and they were all happy for me. I suddenly felt like I was part of some elite group of full grown women. It was almost empowering or something. Nobody had any pads, so I went to the nurse and had my mom come pick me up. She was pretty excited too, cuz we'd both been waiting for my "womanhood" to show up for a couple years now, since all of my friends got theirs in middle school. Anyway, soon after regulating my period, it became much less exciting and I realized the true horror of real cramps. No me gusta. 

TL;DR: Was excited when I finally got my period @ 15. Shortly regretted ever wanting it at all.
