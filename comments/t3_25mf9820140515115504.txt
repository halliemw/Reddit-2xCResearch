I'm 30, never had, nor wanted them done. My mother didn't either. I had my belly button pierced until earlier this year, but finally got bored of it (had it done at 16 so it had a good run)

My husbands only issue is, since I don't wear rings other that my wedding, and engaments rings (both plain bands, one silver one gold) and I tend not to wear braclets he's stuck buying me necklaces if he wants to buy me something sparkely - and even then I only really like plain silver necklaces, and I only have one neck.

His mother fixed this a little by buying me a charms braclet for my 30th, and I've trained him to buy me charms for that ;)
