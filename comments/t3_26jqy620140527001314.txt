You obviously know more than me but putting the water as hot as it goes and holding it under the faucet doesn't help? Just wondering. That's what I do when I wash especially stuck on food off my dishes. I just don't put my hands under the water. I do special effects makeup so I have some pins in the bathroom anyway (for when I do looks with them). I'll have to take a few out and sterilize them.
