As far as I'm concerned, the mods failed us the second they made the decision to open this sub as a default without consultation, resulting in a significant quality drop. With the steady stream of downvotes, outright trolling, "As a man..." remarks and everything in between I simply feel it's not worth the effort. Do you really believe these things will fade away in a few days and everything will return to normal? The struggle will go on for as long as this sub remains a default. Are you all going to fight it/leave for that long?

If the ship is going to go down, the mods can go down on it alone - it's their fault it ran into the fucking iceberg and they don't deserve any help.
