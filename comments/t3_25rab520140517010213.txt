Wearing makeup for bridal photography may not be such a bad idea and really make a difference.  the lighting can really wash out someone's complexion.  Just a bit of contouring can already help highlight your natural beauty for the lens. 

but for everyday, by all means go and enjoy being bare-faced.  its refreshing.  I feel the older generation are more used to seeing a "dolled-up" prim and proper look.
