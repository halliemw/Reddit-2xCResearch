Most welcome. Try your best to get past the feelings of patheticness.  For me with dickwipes like this in my past, it's far better to take your energy and forget him as he's proved he's not worth any fucks (except as a FWB if you so choose) and that your energy is better spent on looking forward to a guy that is worth your precious time and energy.

I've notice in my female colleagues they place their worth based on what others think of them. Fuck that. Base your worth on the value you put in your time and energy. He's shown he's not worthy of either.
