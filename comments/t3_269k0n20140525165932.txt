you say these exist: laws banning continual () harassment" and yet next sentence you say "you can't ban online bullying"
They are the same thing, so yeah, online bullying has been to some effect banned. 

But the limitation to all these laws is the 1st Amendment, which I already stated PROTECTS CERTAIN KINDS OF SPEECH (like the terrible political view scenario you've brought up). It's not going anywhere, and you're seriously underestimating its ability to restrict laws that restrict legitimate free speech. 

And once again, you're speculating without giving the evidence I requested. You're entitled to an argument based on your personal belief and made up scenarios (calling someone a fascist is protected political speech), but without evidence of this as an actual problem in the face of current laws, your argument is weaker and this conversation very clearly has nowhere further to go.
