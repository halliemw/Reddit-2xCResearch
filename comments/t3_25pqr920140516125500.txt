> We have an employee pay plan handed out every year. We can look up every positions' salary. It's available at HR for any employee to look at. 

If the information is basically public, I would say she just brings it up to her boss directly:  "Hey, I noticed Bob make about $20K more than me.  From the outside, it seems like we have equal responsibilities.  Am I wrong about that?  If not, what is he bringing to the company that I'm not?  I'd like to have a better understanding of how he is bringing more value to the company so I can do the same".

Then see what the response is and take it from there.
