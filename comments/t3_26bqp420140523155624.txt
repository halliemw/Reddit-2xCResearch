I mean it sounds like you're doing stuff. I don't handle our cat litter, and I certainly feel that doing it is equal to or more than some other chore.

Have you ever sat down and looked at every chore that's being done, how often it's being done, and who is doing it? That might give you a better picture of who is doing how much.

Maybe there's more that your husband is doing that you wouldn't do and are therefore not considering? I'm not a neat freak and kind of lazy so my idea of chores is dishes, laundry, pet stuff (litter and feeding), cleaning counters, and general decluttering. Compared to that list it sounds like you're doing your part, but maybe your husband does more stuff than just that and his list of chores to do would be much longer.
