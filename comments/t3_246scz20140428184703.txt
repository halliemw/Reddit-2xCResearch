>Why are you advocating the devil?

Advocating *for* the devil. It's based on the process by which the Catholic Church determines the validity of "miracles". It's actually a very enlightened approach to issues of group psychology, and worth reading about.

To answer the question, why do graduates have to *defend*, not present, their theses? Why did Lincoln create teams of rivals within his administration? Contrarianism is the only method of preventing groupthink. Frankly, you don't ever know if your ideas are of any value at all until someone of exceptional skill (the higher the better, actually) has done everything in their power to tear them down. It ain't fun, but it's about the most productive process in critical thinking.
