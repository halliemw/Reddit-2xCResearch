He was in prison before the first release when he raped someone again. He was then put into a mental institution for 18 years. While I can understand caution in this situation he went through a completely different treatment method this time. Will it be successful? I don't know, but with being in a mental institution he only gets released when they deem him ready to be, that's why a Judge needed to order it.
