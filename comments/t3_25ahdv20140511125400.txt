You know, that is interesting because I also think I could go into interviews more confidently too if I had recently heard an affirmation from a colleague about my work.

I think what bugs me a lot is that this guy didn't think to write that he assisted me. There is so much competition out there and to think that there are all these resumes out the there overstating their work, is pretty frustrating!
