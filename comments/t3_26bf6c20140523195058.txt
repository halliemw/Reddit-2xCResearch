> What do you suggest then when someone makes an unconscious sexist decision??? What should I do in that situation??

Recognize it.  Because if you get passed over for a promotion simply because you're a woman, that means that your superior *will never take you into consideration.*  Ever.  It's based on something you can't control, not on how hard you work.

So then you need to find another job.  And explain to your boss why you're quitting.  And hopefully, you were enough of an asset at your previous job that your boss recognized his/her mistake.
