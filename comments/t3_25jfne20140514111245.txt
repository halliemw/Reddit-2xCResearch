You make a good point re self-identification. I generally avoid the main areas of Reddit (my posting history is almost exclusively here and /r/femalefashionadvice), so I'm not as shy about self-identifying as a woman as I would be if I were posting in, say, /r/politics. 

Trolls are super confusing to me and I don't understand how their brains work.  If having a women-specific area would draw that kind of trolling, and if outing someone as a woman elsewhere on Reddit could be seriously problematic, then we should definitely take affirmative steps to prevent it.  If we want to verify while maintaining anonymity, maybe we could request the same sort of documentation that /r/lawyers does, but allow for blurring of names if a date/time Post-It or note card is included in the picture?
