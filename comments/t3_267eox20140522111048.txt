There is a lack of females in the industry. The article makes good points. Another issue, that is slowly eroding, but probably not slowly enough. Is a lot of the males in the industry just cant seem to behave appropriately around females. There are a lot of guys I've come across that fit the neckbeard stereotype to a T. Or guys who come off just as super creepy. So making a comfortable workplace would be a good step in the right direction, some sort of cultural awareness training or the like.

When i think back to any females i've had classes with. I can't help but remember how bad they were at programming. There were a lot of really bad guys too, but there were also good ones. 

My first programming class/language ever was QBASIC. I was definitely the best in the class, It's where I really found my calling. There was a girl in there who had *no* idea what was going on. I ended up helping her on every assignment. This was high school, so she just took it as an elective so it wasn't something she wanted to be good at. 

This trend continued into college, You would always see guys giving limitless help to the few females that were around. At this point it probably was a passion for them, but they didn't get to learn.
