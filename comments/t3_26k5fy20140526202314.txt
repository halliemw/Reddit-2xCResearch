Of course they blame women and not the lack of resources invested in training physicians. It's ridiculous that what we're scheming to do is make existing doctors work as many hours as possible instead of talking about how to reduce the shortages and make it a more humane career in general. The issues are all too massive and interconnected to even cover in a single comment.
