Ha ha, good point! I have a good pile of "period" underwear. They used to be so cute ;_;

As for the difference, I actually feel a big difference between the cardboard and the plastic ones... the smoothness of the plastic is a lot more comfortable! The cardboard one just always felt a bit weird.

The other day, I just found a 'pro-fit' version from OB which seems to have a slightly smoother outside, and they're super comfy to insert!
