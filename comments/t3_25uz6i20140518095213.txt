This is pretty accurate. My parter and I were at different stages of sexual maturity before we had sex the first time. She was inexperienced, I was not. We spent the better part of 5 months learning about what worked for us before PIV sex. So if you see this as well OP, dont rush. Just enjoy the ride ;)

PS: you might not feel anything with sex the first time. Just keep trying!
