My bf and I are very much into it. Toys, mouth, fingers, he fucks mine with his dick, I fuck his with toys. We have a double ended dildo and we just kinda scissor with it up our asses. 

Story: current bf is the most sexually adventurous guy I have ever been with. He is more experienced and teaches me how to do it the way he likes. Every day I am learning. 

Fears: poop. But if you fear the poop too much don't do it. There will be poop. 

Beliefs: I believe in sodomy and deviant sexual behavior. 

Techniques: coconut oil, extra virgin. It has antimicrobial properties and is a fabulous lubricant. Gradually teasing to relax and stretch the hole, and clean short fingernails. Cleaning/sterilizing toys after every use or using condoms with toys. 

Communication is essential. We each own half the island and get one vote. If one of us isn't feeling it, we move on to some other activity. We talk about things, we don't let them sit.
