I have found an apartment off a different website, and my current roommate I found on Craigslist. Both experiences were very positive. 

Like others have said, take someone with you when you go to look at the room/house/whatever. Met the person and everyone else living in the house before you decide to move in. If you get weird vibes, don't go back. Also, it's not inappropriate to ask that a criminal background check be done. I've had one done, and while it's not free, it's worth the cost for peace of mind.
