Hi. I have a large number of clients taking taking Welbutrin. It will take a few weeks to fully be in your blood stream and it is very common to have insomnia as a side effect. This is due to the chemical structure which is slightly similar to stimulants. If you don't take it before bedtime this should help, however, if you were instructed to take it at a certain time consult your medication prescriber.
