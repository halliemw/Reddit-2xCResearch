Since high school I've been involved in a lot of different things that required me to be a confident, young professional.  Here are my two cents:

* Dress the part.  This varies according to your workplace, of course, but in my experience having a well-fitting black suit, conservative heels, pantyhose, and a crisply starched white button down shirt always makes me feel *powerful* and confident in my abilities as a young, professional woman.  (Sounds like you've already got this one down!)  
* The best advice my legal competition coach once gave me was: "Fake it until you make it."  So you're shy, quiet, and soft spoken?  So was I.  But gaining the confidence to stand in front of my elders or superiors and act like I belonged came from first convincing myself that I deserved to be there.  One trick that helped me build confidence was to stand in front of a mirror and practice my speeches.  In your case, stand in front of a mirror and talk about work (projects, hypothetical problems, etc.) and work on your assertiveness and volume.  Also, practice making eye contact with yourself!  Being able to keep steady eye contact is so important for conveying your confidence!
* This sort of piggybacks off the last piece of advice, but another great tip I've gotten is to use the "power triangle" with my hands when speaking in front of or to others.  Body language reflects a person's confidence level a lot, and what you do with yours hands even more so.  [Here's](http://imgur.com/fWAwcrr) an example of a woman who rocks the shit out of the power triangle.  Also, always keep your posture in mind.    
* Now this piece of advice is a little difficult to put in to practice, but start striking up conversations with random people around you.  The cashier at the grocery store, the server at a restaurant, some rando you meet at a bar, etc.  Putting yourself completely out of your comfort zone will force you to become a more assertive person in the appropriate circumstances and make you feel more comfortable at work.  For example, when I went through recruitment in college (to be in a sorority) I had to speak to at least sixteen random girls from each organization for 30-60 mins. each.  I was TOTALLY out of my comfort zone but after that week long experience and the subsequent years I had to be the one on the other side, I can literally talk to a brick wall.  It's all about gaining the experience.  

Confidence isn't going to magically appear out of the air after reading this advice, though.  You have to work at it and practice the things I recommended above.  But you can do it!  Good luck.
