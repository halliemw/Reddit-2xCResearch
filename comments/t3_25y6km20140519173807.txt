salvadoran female here. This issue is real. Every day several woman are jailed for having an abortion, even if the baby they carried was endangering their life. In my opinion its sad to live in such culture in which abortion is seen as a crime. 

Don't get me wrong, i respect people who strongly believe in the sin abortion is, but i think its sad to make it a crime that can take you to jail.
