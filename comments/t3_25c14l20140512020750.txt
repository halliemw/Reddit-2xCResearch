You must not have read my first comment. I explained how you were assigning blame. You said what OP did "doesn't seem like what friends do". That's blame right there. 

EDIT: Never mind. According to your post history "I've been diagnosed as a sociopath by my psychiatrist so I don't really feel much emotion, positive or negative." Trying to explain emotions to you is going to be like trying to knock over a brick wall with cotton balls.

Also "Please stop making things up, I've already asked you once". You said that to someone else not me. This is the first time you've said this to me. You're not so good at emotions or reading comprehension either it seems
