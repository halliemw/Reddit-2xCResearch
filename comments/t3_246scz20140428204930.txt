She _is_ named. We just aren't privy to her given name (in Part 1). We do have her code name (Black Mambo) and uh...nickname (? I'm not sure what "the Bride" would be considered).

EDIT: Oh! I just remembered...good lip readers knew her given name in the first one. There was a flashback scene where someone (Bill?) says her name in view of the camera, but the sound is bleeped out. Not to mention, she's called "Kiddo" a few times by Bill, but it's made to seem like it's a nickname ("kiddo").
