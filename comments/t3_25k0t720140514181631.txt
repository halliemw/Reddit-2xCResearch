I once heard a teenage girl say to another in a conversation I was not involved in (and thus I didn't correct her) that you don't actually need to take all the birth control pills that come in the pack and that you could "miss like 2 or 3 a month and as long as you don't miss more than one in a row you're still ok"

I'm a male who's never had to take birth control pills and even I know that you not only have to take them all but you should take them at the same time every day because even a few hours difference can lead to them being ineffective.
