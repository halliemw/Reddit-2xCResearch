Have you tried a hydrogen peroxide douche? I know douching is not usually a great idea, but it always helps me when dealing with BV. Use a ratio of 1 to 1 water and hydrogen peroxide. If you can't find florastor then you can also use regular probiotic pills. I take them orally but have a friend who inserts them vaginally to help her with BV or yeast.
