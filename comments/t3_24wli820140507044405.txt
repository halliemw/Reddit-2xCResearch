I know nobody will agree with me, but I don't think they did anything wrong. 

The gist of the joke was this: some geek girls try to make looking geeky sexy, and they fail.  What's offensive about that?  Are we never ever supposed to ever make fun of women, ever?  

The article says that the reason people were outraged is that: 

> the implication that being more like the woman on the left is somehow better or more desirable than being like the woman on the right (Mayim Bialik as Amy in “The Big Bang Theory”). 

I don't think the ad implies that at all.  The ad just pokes fun at women who want to objectify themselves by trying to look "sexy," when they are really just a woman wearing a geek outfit.  It's no different than if you made fun of a man who wanted to look like a badass by wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, but really just looked like a guy wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt.
