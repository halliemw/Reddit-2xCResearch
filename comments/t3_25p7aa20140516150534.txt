As as slight correction, the [just listen thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2526zx/new_sidebar_rule_request_in_light_of_being/) wasn't made by a mod, even thought the title was phrased that way. 

I agree with you. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25oc17/i_f22_had_sex_with_a_woman_for_the_first_time/chj67yn) is an example of a post that was on the wrong side of some line, and is currently at  -40 (52|94). 

It seems that a sizeable (or vocal) portion of twox has felt threatened, and has doubled down on their stances. 

Since I haven't gotten any creepy PMs (I don't post often), and all of the comments at the bottom of the post have been deleted, the only change I've seen in twox recently is that it has become more polarized.
