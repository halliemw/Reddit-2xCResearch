I feel like this guy just isn't worth your time. I think you are correct in assessing that he realized you were amazing in bed and he cut the cord on a good thing too soon. Since you were bringing the excellent sexual chemistry I'm sure you could find that again with another guy. Maybe someone who is worth more then FWB even? Either way, he seems like he is replaceable and not worth the wondering or worrying when the next time he might try and bail out on booty calls because he randomly decided you are "too college" ...whatever the fuck that means. Next time it could be some different cryptic bullshit. I say cut ties and move on to a smarter and hotter piece of ass.
