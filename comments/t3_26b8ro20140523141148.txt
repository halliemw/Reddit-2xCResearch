We also have a link in the sidebar. The rule is about allowing links to other subreddits - right now, it's very strict. I understand it's irritating, but it is necessary. The vice versa applies.

Linking to other subreddits with less than 100,000 subscribers is not allowed right now. This rule is firm.

ETA: You can still say "check out these subs, X and Y", the link itself just can't be there.
