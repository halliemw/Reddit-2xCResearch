In this instance, you can actually have the cops come by. Clean house first. But be QUICK!

They usually have the actual cops working in the mornings (no offence, but night cops are crooked here), and they are more than willing to break out the dogs and hunt a dude down for women.

We had something VERY similar happen, a cracked out dude breaking in randomly at 5:30am, we called the cops some hours later and they insisted if we called them, with having so many women living in our place (5br house, all women), that they'd have brought the dogs over and would have been able to pick them up.

Just a suggestion.
