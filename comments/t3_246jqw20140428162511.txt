You are asking if a (very) lazy person can become (very) active. Instead, how about if you can become "less lazy". 

Set really really tiny goals for yourself. I don't know where you live, but the weather is going from really crappy to really nice near here. Perfect to say "I'm going to go for a 5 minute walk". Just take a 5 minute walk every day......if you like it, go for 10, 15, etc. Set really tiny goals in your house. Today, I'm going to organize this 1 shelf. Today I'm going through this 1 pile of papers. Today I'm going to clean the microwave. I know I'm guilty of setting these goals and not following through, but they are much easier and much more likely to get completed than "today I am going to exercise" or "today I'm going to clean my house". As you do it more often, maybe you can add to it.
