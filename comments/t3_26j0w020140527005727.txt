You know, this whole case sort of reminds me about the case of ABB here in Norway -- who slaughtered 77 teenagers and adults back in '11 because of a paranoid, insane world-view that he held.

The main point of the trial there was whether or not he was criminally or legally insane. The question was never if he was sane or not, but if he was *criminally* so, which would have meant psychiatric treatment rather than the prison. Now the entire process is something of a clusterfuck but in the end he was judged legally insane and fit to be judged as a sane person. 

The point I was trying to make, though, was that no one was denying him of being insane. That was evident by his actions alone, a sane person does not kill 77  teenagers belonging to a political camp without mercy just because he think he's some Knight Templar Reborn and was preventing a Muslim Invasion. 

Fact is that all the racism, the paranoia, the fear, the delusion of grandeur and so on; it requires a mind with absolute lack of empathy, a lack of understanding consequence and valuing human life. And it's not an excuse, it's a very valid, very central piece of it all.
