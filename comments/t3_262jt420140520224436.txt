I didn't click on this to come preach at you about abortion, I promise. But I feel like you don't even want to do this... you said, "I don't want to kill my child..."  If you feel this bad about it now, chances are you're gonna feel worse after the abortion.

If you believe (as I happen to) that abortion is killing a child, maybe you can find another option? You're early in the pregnancy and you have time to consider some other options. 

Either way, I'll stop and say a prayer that you will have peace.
