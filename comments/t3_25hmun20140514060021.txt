The logic for that is you woman are more useful in the long run and that's why if WW3 broke out I would likely get conscripted and you wouldn't, it takes one man and what ever amount of woman to have children but 1 woman and what ever amount of men = 1 child, and after a major disaster that could wipe out a large proportion of the population your going to want to have the means for the population to grow again. At least that is my interpretation for reason for those sorts of rules/laws
