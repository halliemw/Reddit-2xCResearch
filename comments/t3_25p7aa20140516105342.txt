I actually think some of the posters here are instigators pretending to be "intellectual feminists," of some kind. MOSTLY because the influx of "check your privelege" type posts. I almost NEVER saw that phrase before 2x changed to a default and now I see things like that regularly. I think some people are having a great time diminishing the conversation on this subreddit now that they can pretend to be a liberated woman.
