Nioxin isn't like rogain, where it's just a topical. I use one of their systems, which is a shampoo/conditioner/spray. The S/C is awesome in it's own right, it fixed my dandruff and my SO's super super dry scalp. It's also made for fine hair, so I can use the conditioner on my scalp/roots and it doesn't weigh my hair down. The spray I leave in the shower and I spray and rub around in my roots before I wrap my hair up and give it time to soak into my scalp. I think they have other products now, but I just use the basic ones. My SO is already going balding, he takes propicia and he started nioxin when I met him and the nioxin stopped his hair loss even further. I have been bad and haven't used it in the past year(I've been at cosmetology school and trying different things), but my hair is getting back to the way too fine stage, my braid is just pitiful, and I am starting to use it again. Nioxin is sadly expensive, but there is an offbrand at Sally's that is supposed to be a direct dupe. I'll probably be trying that next.
