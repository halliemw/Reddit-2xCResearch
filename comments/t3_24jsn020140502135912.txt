Oh, I didn't know we had dress codes in place because otherwise there would be a rash of rapes in high schools all over the country! /s

Stop reaching for the far end of plausibility to what rape culture is, and how you can wedge school dress codes into being responsible for creating said culture.

Do you believe there is an inherent level of sexual attraction as a part of the human condition, based largely on visual stimuli?  Do believe a sexual attraction can be distracting, especially if there is a visual stimuli present?  Do you believe that finding somebody attractive automatically relegates them to object status?  Can you understand why a high school full of adolescent students would want to limit the amount of sexual attraction that builds during the school day, when and where learning occurs?  Can you accept that it actually is in the best interest of a educational environment to remove distractions when they prevent effective learning?

I know you won't, but I want you to answer those 5 questions, and only then move onto this next one.

Is endeavoring to limit the source of a distraction, caused by sexual attraction, through limiting visual stimuli, by implementation of a dress code an appropriate function of a school??

If you answered 'no' to any of those questions above, you may have to reconsider how you frame rape culture, human sexuality, sexual attraction, and the role of educational bodies.

None of that is related at all to rape.  It is a simple function of humanity's reaction to sexuality, and the responsibility of a educational body to limit distractions.
