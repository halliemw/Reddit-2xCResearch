I don't know of any bc pills that will INCREASE your sex drive. I'm using TriSprintec (generic ortho tricyclen) and I have felt most like my normal, higher libido with that. I had my lowest libido when I tried depo, which is progestin only. 

Definitely try different pills or methods if you're not happy with the side effects.  It defeats the purpose if you take the pills but never have sex!
