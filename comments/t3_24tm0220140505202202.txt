That's a great idea! A few of my friends are not in the city (university co-op to other countries or in other cities) so this isn't possible at the moment, but we should be able to do this in a few months! I do invite my boyfriend out with my friends from time to time. He was already friends with a few of them before we met. I know of (but haven't officially met) some of his friends, and he never invited me to hang out with them (like I mentioned, even when his friends are bringing their girlfriends).
