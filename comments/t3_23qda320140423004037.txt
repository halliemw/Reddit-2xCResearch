Thanks so much! So glad I posted here, I was reacting very immaturely but I didn't quite know how to get over myself.  I could feel myself growing more and more bitter towards him and our relationship. I'm sorry that your relationship didn't work out, but I hope I'll be able to take your advice and use it to help out mine. 

While it may be sore for a while, I think it'll turn out ok. :)
