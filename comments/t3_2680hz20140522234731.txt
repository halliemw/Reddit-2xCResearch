Ok I'm not sure how to do a pm, and please don't think I'm searching for some pity. Your post just made me think of that for the first time in years.
Honestly I've been single for awhile so my feelings have faded pretty good, I'm more like a robot now, kinda just going through the motions in life.
Sorry but this timer thingy makes me wait forever to type messages on here.
