I have been a gamer all my life, mostly MMO's. I never had a problem in MMO's to be honest apart from the occasional crush someone developed on me because they liked my voice. I found the ratio of men to women playing was better and the guilds that I joined were always respectful.

These days I play DOTA2 pretty hardcore. It is a completely different story. I never ever ever identify as a woman if I can possibly avoid it. If I do talk for some reason there is always someone on my team ready to shout 'OMG ARE YOU A GIRL??'  It frustrates my partner and my friends probably more than me because I am used to it, so they tend to rage on my behalf when someone types shit like 'oh your voice is making me melt' or 'you sound so hot'.

I just ignore it and try to always type not talk. The worst is if I talk accidentally and we are losing because all of a sudden (no matter how well I am playing) we are losing because there is a girl on the team.
