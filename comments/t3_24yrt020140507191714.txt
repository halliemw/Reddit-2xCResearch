Oh come on - I've been on 2XC for *years*, and if there's one common error that's *absolutely* characteristic of this community it's the patented 2XC:

>> Someone makes a perfectly reasonable *general* statement with obvious implied (or even flat-out *stated*) caveats

> Someone follows up with a moral-high-ground-seizing "Nuh-uh! *I'm* a <person> and I <don't conform to the generalisation>. Stop dismissing my existence!".

We're a great community here, but if I see one more non-controversial statement like "women are generally shorter and have larger breasts than men" followed up by a *completely irrelevant* "Nuh-uh! I'm a seven-foot amazon with a double mastectomy! Stop silencing my voice!" I swear I'm going to scream.

ScrubTutor was not diluting or adding anything new to this sub - if anything he was inadvertently parroting something that's *absolutely characteristic* of it:

* An almost total blindness to obvious implied (or even *flat-out baldly stated*) caveats, and
* The mistaken belief that you can disprove a general statement about overall preponderances and statistical averages with one single, statistically-irrelevant counterexample.

I love this community, but **god damn** do we have a collective blind spot with that particular little logical fallacy.
