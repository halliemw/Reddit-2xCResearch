people here are either completely missing your point or they think that some women should still be called 'sluts'. this implies that they believe that promiscuity needs to be judged negatively (why else have the word?), which is pretty misogynistic, as you observe.

the word 'slut' is meant to condemn something that isn't bad and doesn't need judging. the word has no use in modern society. it's like using the word "heathen" to describe an atheist. there is no need to 'take the word back' or try to use it positively. it's simply an obsolete word that's not used by people with class.
