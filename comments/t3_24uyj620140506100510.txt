I actually agree that you should say something. Normally, I wouldn't, but to be honest, who cares about burning bridges in this case? Not because of revenge, but because it's not like this woman is going to be a reference for you regardless. So, I'd (professionally) tell HR everything, and if you have proof - bring it.
