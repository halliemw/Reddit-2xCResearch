I graduated college last year with a genetics degree. All of my biology and chemistry classes were at least 60% female students. I had an equal number of men and women professors, equal number of men and women TAs, and two of the three professors whose labs I interned in over the years were women. I took an honors biodiversity studies class senior year that only accepted 12 students... 10 of them including me were women. 

The only guy I met who was very vocal about his "hurrrrrr women aren't hard wired to be good at science" beliefs, didn't make it through his second year in the same program I was in. 

You probably have absolutely nothing to worry about.
