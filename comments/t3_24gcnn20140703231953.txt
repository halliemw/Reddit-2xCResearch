I love stories about how books work their way into your heart. My mother read the first book to me when I was little. She wanted to promote a love of reading and a very strong sense of self (both of which I now have, well done mom) and we both loved this book. I will have to read them again as an adult. I find when you read these kinds of books as an adult they mean so much more.

I must recommend Anne Bishop's Black Jewel Trilogy to you. It is my all time favourite fantasy series and has very strong characters. For me this series is absolutely pivotal. It is adult fiction however, so just be warned if you are especially sensitive to violence. But it is well worth a read (or several).
