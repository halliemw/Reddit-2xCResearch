Just to offer another side to this. It's not always jealousy even though it can REALLY look that way. I worked with a group of women for a long time and things were always good. We all got along fine, everyone fit in. Then came Jen. She was beautiful. I mean really beautiful and nice! She was friendly and liked to chat quite a bit. She had trouble staying on task. The problem began when it started to effect our work. A
Rep would come in for product knowledge meetings. We needed these meeting to go over pricing issues, claims, etc. These were generally older guys that loved Jen and the her flirty ways. Fine, but we had pending issues to discuss. When I (or another woman) would interrupt them chatting about whatever club she went to and say " Ok, Mr. G I really need to discuss these price lists with you..." I would get an eye roll from the Rep and hear some comment like "ok killjoy". 
One day she was rushing to finish a job when a male co worker asked her what she was up to. She said " Trying to get this done. I was given a deadline" he said to her "Oh don't worry about the deadline. The old hens are just ruffled over the new chick". Whaaat? We had work that was due and couldn't be completed until hers was finished. It had NOTHING to do with jealousy at all. Months of this, day after day, naturally led to resentment. She ended up quitting because she didn't "fit in". Said we all visited but got mad when she did. The difference was we finished our work and didn't make other wait on us. Every outside person was convinced we were jealous and pushed out the pretty young girl. The fact was the pretty young girl had much maturing to do and wasn't ready for that environment. It still bothers me a bit to that people thought that. Outside of work she was wonderful, just not a good co-worker.
