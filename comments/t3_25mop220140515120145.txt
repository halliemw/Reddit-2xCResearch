I can appreciate and relate to your desire to be everything for him -- because you love him so much and want to be the one to make him feel better -- but you cannot put that all on yourself.  In the long term, this can really sour a relationship.  Trust me.

There is some huge stigma about seeing a therapist, it seems, and it is such a shame.  Even people who say they're cool with other people seeking therapy sometimes avoid seeking therapy themselves.  One negative experience seeing a psychiatrist or a behavioral therapist can prejudice a person against the entire field, and it shouldn't.

Finding the right therapist can take some trial and error.  If you don't like a therapist up front, you can stop and try another.  And keep trying until you find someone you feel comfortable opening up to.

Alas, you can't make someone seek help if they don't want to.  But perhaps you can decriminalize the field for him.  Couples therapy could be good.  I know that "couples therapy" might have a worse stigma than individual therapy, but I think that's because most couples see it as a last resort.  It shouldn't be.  Your boyfriend obviously takes care of his physical health at the gym, he should want to maintain his mental health as well.  Seeing a therapist is like going to the gym: it's not just for emergency cases.  It's about maintaining health.

If you go the couples therapy route, you could explain that it's more about your issues.  He would be helping YOU by going and being your support.  That might take the weight off of "You need help".
