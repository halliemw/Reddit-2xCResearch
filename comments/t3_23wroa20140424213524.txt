I have been through this exact same thing with my parents/family! Also 21 and never had a bf... (although my hair is long!) But I am very passionate about LGBTQ rights -- apparently this means I must be lesbian! It was actually awful to go through. "Why would you care so much about gay rights if you're not gay," my mom would ask. Gee, I dunno Mom, maybe because I'm a DECENT PERSON?!?!
My brother would tease me about being lesbian, my parents would give each other knowing looks -- at one point we were going to be having four lesbian women for dinner, which I thought was a neat coincidence, so I mentioned it to my mom. "Are you sure there won't be five," she said (referring to me). It was absolutely awful -- not because I was uncomfortable people thought I was lesbian, but just because my parents thought I was lying and refused to believe the truth about my sexuality. No matter how many times I told them I was straight! But this was all about 1-2 years ago, and it's since died down.
I'm trying to remember how for you -- I think they just kind of got bored of questioning me, because I persisted in telling them I was straight. And I told then it hurt my feelings that they didn't believe me and that I found it frustrating, and that they could ask me a billion times if I was gay and a billion times the answer would be no. So it's pretty much in the past for me now. Hopefully your family, too, will get sick of pestering you when you keep affirming your position. I wish I had better advice for you! Mostly, I just want you to know that I have been through this too and I understand how frustrating and rage-inducing it is! Best of luck.
