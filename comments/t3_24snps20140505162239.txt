This is why I generally hate labels and grouping people into identities. I think I am probably the "butchest" woman behaviorally. I do have a relatively feminine appearance naturally... but if I were a guy - I'd probably also wear my hair long in braids, don a t-shirt and jeans. I guess the only difference would be that I would grow a beard and then braid that too. Totally viking...anyway _ I am straight. You probably won't catch me in a dress, but I am perfectly content to be a woman. Although peeing standing up and growing a beard would be cool.
