FUCK THAT. I currently don't want kids. I'm taking a screen shot of this and sending it to my SO so that if things change we will be reminded why we should just buy one. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK all of that. 

And to any judgmental baby lovers out there who may try to vilify me I know that I am selfish and that me wanting to hold onto my figure and sleep and sanity isn't what a mother would do. That is why I choose to not have children. So shut up before you even start with me.
