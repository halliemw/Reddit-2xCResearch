This is a tough one, because it is really about how the woman sees herself, and not what you see. You could make sure you give compliments without them being asked for. The minute she walks into the room you say (something like) Wow, you look really beautiful today, or I love how soft your hair is, or whatever. I've found though, that if someone is convinced they're ugly, there's not much you can do.  A simple "I think you're beautiful" might help, but the truth is, it is so much more about how she feels, than what you tell her.
