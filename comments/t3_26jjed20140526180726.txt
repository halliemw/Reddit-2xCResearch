If you have the time, I would take Krav Maga lessons. Just knowing that you can incapacitate somebody else may make you feel safer. It's hard, but it's something good to know. My mother has a lot of issues (ehlers-danlos, rheumatoid arthritis), and she took a lot of lessons. If you live near a studio, they might give you one or two lessons for Free. I know you said you have issues waking up, but if you spray them with pepper spray, and they keep going, it's something to fall back on.
