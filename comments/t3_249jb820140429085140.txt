Wanna know why this woman is full of shit?

Because damn near EVERY survey of this issue turns up the same numbers. 

The most recent report cites a single study (because you have to cite something) but PILES and PILES and PILES of work backs it up. 

Hell, I did a study in grad school (early 90s) where we asked college women two questions.  1) Have you ever been raped? and 2) Have you ever had sex with someone because you were afraid of the threat of physical violence?  Over 20% of women said yes to at least one of these questions. We got more women, and asked them, too. Over 20%. Did it another year, with more women. Over 20%.  

1 in 5. Yup.
