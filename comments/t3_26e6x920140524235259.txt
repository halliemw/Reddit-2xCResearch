As an adult I feel that we should be mature enough to cope with feelings. It seems extreme to ostracize someone for having an infatuation.

People were already trickling out of the party room. I chose to leave as he left since I was his only original acquaintance at the gathering. I thought it would be polite to thank him for coming and say goodbye rather then wave him off across the room.

Alcohol was present, sure, but not in obscene amounts. You are making it seem like we stumbled out shitfaced and groping at eachother. Relax. We walked out the door at the same time and walked in the same direction. This man is, in a way, my superior in my proffession, and I admit that I did not know it would come to this, nor that his emotions were this strong. I can't read minds.

Stop assuming the worse of everything. You are making your own facts about an evening you were not present at. I may have avoided the situation, sure. But I did not expect limits to be crossed. Should I always be accompagnied now, in case any random male decides now is the moment to confess his love? That's absurd.

I should have been more guarded, okay, I can handle that. But he should have shown respect and restraint.

The situation is over and all parties have moved on. I need time and space for him to sort out his feelings, and I am not planning on spending alone time with him. 

I came here for emotional support for the initial shock. Not slut-shaming drivel.
