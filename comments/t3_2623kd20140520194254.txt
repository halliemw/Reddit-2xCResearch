A couple things to note:

1. In the future, motivational speeches are best delivered in relevant situations. I was talking about impostor syndrome, you were talking about...I don't even know what.

2. The motivational speech of "no one gives a shit about you so you have to do it all for yourself" is just a bad speech. It's not tough love. It's mean. And if internships were really like that, there'd be no returning employees ever. 

3. Interns are not hired to do a job. They are hired to learn so that they can someday do a job. The idea that I should come to work and "do my job" with "minimal handholding" is ridiculous, that's more a rule for salaried people who already have experience.
