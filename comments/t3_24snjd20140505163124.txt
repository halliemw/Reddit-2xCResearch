Bipolar doesn't exactly...go anywhere. It doesn't go into remission. You get times of stability sometimes, but you're always either up, down, or on the way there. 


Other things you mentioned sound to me like he is in a period of mania. Mania is usually more dangerous that depression. He should see a therapist.
