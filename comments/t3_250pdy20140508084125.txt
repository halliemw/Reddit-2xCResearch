I had a friend who was struggling very much like this. I too felt like I was running out of suggestions and turned to the internet for tips on coping. Anyway it took a much bigger toll on me than I realised. It affected my job as I would always sneak off with my phone to check up on her and make sure she was ok with an uplifting text. One day I just broke down in front of my parents and told them about it all. They were really concerned and told me that I couldnt be responsible for others.

Things have improved a lot now, and I think my support did help a lot at the time. I always keep a watchful eye to make sure everything is fine, however I still panic if I cant get hold of her or she hasnt text in a while. It definitely has a big effect on the person who is trying to offer the support too.
