I think the problem is that so many people seem to want to have a laser focus on all the problems and what could possibly be offensive in the tweets... And in the meantime, have little to nothing to say about the overall problem that's being talked about. If all you have to say about a frank, open discussion about the violence and sexism that women face is "hey some of these tweets are offensive" then you're missing the bigger picture.
