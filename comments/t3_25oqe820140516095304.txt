> My advice to women who are worried about rape or worried about a new guy they are interested in, is to try and find a straight guy who you trust to check them out. I can find out anything about a guy if I get drunk with him.

this is so true it could save your life. Douche dudes are the first ones to state their intention to mistreat a woman to another dude. Part of why they do it in the first place is so they can brag about it later, just got to convince them to brag about it before it even happens and bam! predator identified and no one had to get hurt.
