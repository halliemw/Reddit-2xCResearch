I've done this - taken a selfie with my sleeping friends. Different context - usually in the car or plane during long trips to show them how funny they look sleeping. Also, sober. AND never posting online or sending to other people. It depends on the relationship you have with the other person. It's only been very close friends, I'd never do it to an acquaintance or someone who I didn't feel entirely comfortable with. The friendships where you just know you can do these things in. If you wake the friend up to gain consent it ruins the shot ;)

This situation - it's hard to tell. Possibly these 4 friends do it to each other all the time, and have a mutual understanding of it. 
Even more likely, though, is that they were drunk and thought it would be hilarious to take a selfie with your mate and post it on the internet with some ridiculous hashtags (my faith in drunk young people is rather poor). I think you did the right thing, but I also believe that it's a grey area.
