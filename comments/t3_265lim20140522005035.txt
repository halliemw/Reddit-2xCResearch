So you are on a shady street, and this highly violent and known felon approaches you and puts a paternalistic but firm hand on your shoulder. He smiles knowingly and says "may I have a loan? I would **greatly** appreciate it. If you cannot help me it would **HURT** me so bad." You know what happens when people say no to this guy. 

Do you say no? Do you hand over the wallet? If you hand over the wallet, did you give him a loan? Or was your wallet stolen?



Jesus Christ people getting shit under coercion or implied threat is not some foreign concept.
