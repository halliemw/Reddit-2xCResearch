I just checked back here after seeing it became default (I'm male and contribute occasionally and enjoy the sub) not sure about a lot of stuff but it does sound like a lot of trolls are spoiling the bunch. 

But I mean remove downvotes only for posts? Or for comments as well?  

I'd be afraid that if downvotes for comments was disabled we'd get harmful advice getting views seriously. 

As well as visitors seeing comments that don't represent the sub very well having a positive score?
