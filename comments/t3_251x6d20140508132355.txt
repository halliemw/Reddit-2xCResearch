I don't want to come off as critical OP, but i think you're overreacting a little bit. I say "a little bit" because this likely would've been a non issue if your BF had communicated his intent with you ahead of time. 

Either way, I'm a guy who has been and seen relationships crumble between two coworkers when they would've otherwise been fine if the two people didn't work together. Your bf might have logical explanation for it but I completely understand the need to rant.
