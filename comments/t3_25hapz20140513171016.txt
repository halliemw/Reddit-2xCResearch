Did he know that the anniversary was important to you?  Did you get him a card?  Had you talked about it beforehand?  Maybe he didn't realize it was important to you.

I think you need to sit him down and talk about this.  Where do you want the relationship to be in a year?  5 years?  What role would you like the car hobby to play in those timeframes?  Would you like to be spending weekends with him down the road?  Will you be able to marry someone who you won't spend weekends with?  You should answer these questions for yourself before talking to him.  And of course, don't frame it as something he's doing wrong.  You're just trying to figure out how to live around the hobby.

As for how much is too much, that's something only you can answer.  It's okay if it's too much now and that's a dealbreaker for you.
