Yeah I felt like I was pretty prepared for stuff like this but then when it happened I totally just froze up. I definitely know what you mean about it being a cultural thing though, since a lot of middle eastern men I've worked with have run into problems with making people uncomfortable in our work space. Most of them are also very rich and here just to get the degree before going back home and I don't think they're used to having anyone find fault with them.
