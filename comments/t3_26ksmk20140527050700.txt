I would love to be 150 lbs again. I eat right and exercise and am still chubby. The only way I can be "skinny" is to starve and abuse diet pills. 200 years ago my body type was ideal. Go figure (pun intended).
What's "ideal" and what's healthy are two different things. Depending on your height 150 may very well be within your normal BMI range.
