Mansplaining isn't a general "anytime men comment" sort of thing. it happens when, for instance, a group of women are discussing, say, street harassment. And they're talking about it, sharing experiences, and then a guy pops in and starts explaining why their experiences are wrong, erroneous, not reflective of "real life", etc. occasionally it occurs when a man is being condescending and expecting that a woman, or women, know less than him on a subject just by them being women (my chemistry major friend did this when some scientific topics came up in discussion, not aware that the other girl at the table had 5 years lab experience and was a year away from a doctorate when he has an undergrad...they both clearly knew stuff, but she was talking down to her something fierce and she kep trying to correct him at times or just engage in discussion, but he's just shut her down again and again in an attempt to 'educate' her).

Thus, mansplaining sometimes happens in areas like academia, but happens fairly often with experience-based discussions led by women.
