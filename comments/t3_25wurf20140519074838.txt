You may come off as cold or you may have the same problem my boyfriend had when he first met my friends: people are wary of salesmen. You mentioned that you're normally shy but you trained for your job at conventions. Be honest- do you take off that salesmen persona when you're with new potential friends? People can (even if just subconsciously) tell when you're focusing on holding yourself just right and saying just the right thing. Maybe try relaxing and being a bit less polished. You'll be less of the "lady" that your SO loves but you might be happier I'm the long run.
