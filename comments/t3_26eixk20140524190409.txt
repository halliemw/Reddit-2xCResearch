From one person in particular ***[WARNING: HORRIBLE MISREPRESENTATION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE, VICTIM BLAMING]***:

> Men are raped by matriarchal dominance

> Men are physically dominant because of millions of years of evolution

> Defending feminism is throwing out all known facts of life, and letting women play a victim role instead of facing their responsibilities

This is what I mean when I say "typical redpill stuff". I have seen other people espousing the same views, though I don't have screenshots of that. I'm angry enough that this kind of garbage exists, and having it propagate beyond fringe communities just make it worse.
