As you were told in modmail, we aren't removing dissent. There is tons of posts expressing dissent, we are reading it all and responding to a lot of it.

We are, however, removing posts from dudes complaining about the period posts. We always talk about about our periods here, we're women. Maybe not normally to this degree, but there have always been incredibly disgusting, informative, and hilarious bodily fluid discussions on this subreddit. It's fun and we're having fun right now for IFF, see the CSS sticky.
