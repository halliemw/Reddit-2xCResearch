Criminals get released every day. We kinda have to trust the system that it makes the right choice. Surely he's been evaluated several times and could possibly be on chemical castration. There are people who commit crimes, get out, and then live a normal life with out hurting anyone again. It says he committed those crimes 30+ years ago. It's good to know that he was released and to be wary of him. I hope they keep a close eye on him but I feel that it is possible that he is actually rehabilitated. That is the point of the justice system.
