Hehe, what a fun reading exercise- it is neat! I love old ads like this... where did you find it? I love how candidly they speak about all of it too... not like in the US, where everything was and is always hush-hush when it comes to periods/vaginas.

I actually am native English speaking, but I am learning German and I've lived in Germany for a few years :D

thanks!
