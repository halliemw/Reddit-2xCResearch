I have a similar problem - I'm only 5'9 but I have a very long torso. I found a one piece a few years ago that fit perfectly because it was low cut so it didn't need to be pulled up quite as much. It's great if you don't mind your boobs showing a bit. I'm so scared for the day I wear mine out. I hateeee bikinis
