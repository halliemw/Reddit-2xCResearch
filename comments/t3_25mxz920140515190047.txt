Let's be honest. 

If you do this, enjoy it and sadly nothing comes of it, you have an experience under your belt and can live without the regret. You'll have no 'what ifs' and you'll be certain on a path towards a safe and secure income having tried your best at least once- who knows, possible opportunities might come from it years down the line!

If it goes well, you'll gain something even more substantial and you'll be happy you did it.

Don't do it and sure, you'll have the money you saved, but you'll also have the 'what ifs' and possible regrets.

DO IT, YOU DRAW BEAUTIFULLY.
