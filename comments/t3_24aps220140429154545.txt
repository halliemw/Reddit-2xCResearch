Jeez. That doesn't sound like an equal relationship at all. What I'm getting out of this is: 1) have sex for his pleasure not yours 2) let him be a lazy ass and not take out the trash or do the chores he has to do because he works all day for your "ungrateful ass" 3) let your husband make fun of you and trash your house with his friends, because you're the super cool and hot wife.
