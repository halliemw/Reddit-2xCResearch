That's a good point. Repunzel seems flawed for having short hair because it was magical hair when long making her ordinary after cutting it. Although, I don't really think Mulan was flawed when she cuts her hair. She was looking for an identity and found she is a strong leader and a soldier. Her cutting her hair helped her find who she really was, even though it was less feminine, I wouldn't consider it flawed. 

Other than that, it seems all of the princesses have that classic long flowing, usually fair colored hair. I remember wanting blonde hair as a kid so I could look more like a princess and always kept my hair long. I was such a tomboy in personality looking like a girl kept people from thinking I was a little boy.
