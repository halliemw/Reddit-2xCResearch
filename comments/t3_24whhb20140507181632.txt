Ya, you don't have a good point here at all. He's not being manipulative, nor is he forcing her to go through with the abortion. His body is his damn body. And if her actions makes him feel sick being around her, why should she be able to force him to stay around her? He is telling her the truth. If she got an abortion, he would be angry enough at her to break up with her. I'd do the same thing personally. Its not melodramatic? How is being upset that what he considers his child is going to be killed melodramatic or emotionally immature? Tons of people would be upset over this, including other women. Why should he have to compromise over something he is so strongly against? This is like saying, why can't she compromise and just sign away her rights? 

It may have nothing to do with his body, but it definitely affects his life in a large way. Honestly, you're coming off more radical and sexist now, when you were more logical before.
