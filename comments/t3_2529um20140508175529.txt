Oh boy, it's really brutal reading your description of the event. In my opinion, that's partially because it's tinged with your current hindsight on it. It sounds like inside of your head it's been blown out of proportion. So, first, here's the narrative that I picked up:

- You became emotionally involved with someone
- When you met, he wasn't attracted to you
- You didn't pick up on that fact, you two had sex, and you generally exposed yourself emotionally
- Eventually, when you asked him, he admitted that he wasn't attracted to you.

Try reading that summary over as if it weren't about you. I hope that helps deflate it a little bit for you.

As someone who has seriously embarrassed myself before (often!), I can confidently say that I've done similar, and more embarrassing, things. So, second, here's how I look at things that are embarrassing: they always feel way worse to you than they appear to anyone else; thinking about them always puts that rock in your stomach; but confronting that sickening feeling of mortification is a way to build strength. For people who are particularly sensitive to embarrassment, there's almost nothing more liberating than facing mortification and saying "well, this is as bad as it's gonna get. ever."

So now on to the actual event. You really beat yourself up by saying that you didn't send him the right photos, that it's your fault for not Skyping with him, etc. I'm thinking that this is a load of crap. There's a saying--buyer beware. If he is hung up on looks, it's up to him to ensure that you're his "type". So no matter what, don't feel as though you're to blame.

I'm not really getting how he could spend so much time getting to know you, and growing to like/love you, and then be turned off by you physically. In my experience, for guys, the longer and deeper our relationship with a girl, the less hung up we are on looks. It says a lot about his own security that even after developing a deep relationship with you he still connected looks with attraction.

And was he really repulsed? I don't think so. I think he found himself in a situation where his (HIS) expectations weren't met. What he said, "I'm just not attracted to you" is probably the full truth of it: this one guy, whose inability to see past looks even with someone he knew and cared about, didn't find himself attracted to you when you first met. Most guys I know stop emphasizing looks when they find something deeper to hold on to in someone. So, please don't let yourself feel broken because of this encounter.

Sorry for the rambling.
