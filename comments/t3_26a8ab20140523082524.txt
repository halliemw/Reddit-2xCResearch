> The myth that drunk men "accidentally" go over the line with women has been thoroughly debunked by multiple studies.

I think if this was stressed to men that they do not need to fear "accidentally" raping women than a better conversation could take place on how to prevent sexual assault. The defensive nature of most conversations on rape could be prevented by making it clear that activists aren't trying to turn rape into something that you can be tricked into because of technical legal details.
