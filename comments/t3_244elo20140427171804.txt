Lo Loestrin is the lowest dose combined pill on the market. It's monophasic, so you can use it to skip periods (but you don't have to). I haven't had any problems with it. It has *half* the amount of estrogen as the next lowest pill. 

Downside: there is no generic.

By the way, no one gets their period on the pill. You get something called "withdrawal bleeding" from the drop in hormones, but it's not a menstrual period and it does nothing beneficial for you. You don't need to have it, and you aren't going to harm your fertility by skipping periods.
