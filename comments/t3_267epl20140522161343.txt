> No, if you choose to have sex with someone, knowing that you have no power over whether or not they abort, you know that that's your risk level. 

So if you're a woman in places where abortion is illegal, you shouldn't have sex because you "know your risk level".

Also, since OP seems to know what her sexual partner will say, then they must have talked about this in the past.  Most couples talk about a worst case scenario.  Me and my boyfriend(I'm a girl) agree we want an abortion if I get pregnant.  If I got pregnant and had a child, I'd have the legal right to force him to pay, but I feel doing that is morally wrong since he expressed he does not wish to do that and I'm using violence(by proxy of government) to coerce him into something against his will.  This type of "financial rape" has terrible monetary and emotional consequences for many people who go through it.

> Why should she get 100% of the consequences? 

I don't understand the "consequences" you speak of?  I'm assuming her partner will help her with an abortion.  If she chooses to have a child, that seems to me like SHE'S the one choosing an outcome for herself, not that she's "left with consequences".

Your outlook on this situation seems to wholly undermine female agency, as though she was the passive member of sexual intercourse and not the active participant.
