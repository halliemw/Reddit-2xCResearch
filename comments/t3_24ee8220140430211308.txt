This post makes me feel really really happy. I can relate because I often have depressive moments and high levels of anxiety and it just gets so hard to deal with sometimes. I'm still young (teenager) and I've been doing so much.. This just reminded me to stay positive. I really needed something like this today. Stay strong and all the luck to you!
