Oh absolutely. You didn't mention that in your original post, but yes, I'm 95% sure that's why you're experiencing completely different PMS symptoms. My suggestion would be to talk to your doctor if your BC gives you migraines as a PMS symptom, because there are other types out there that probably won't cause that, and that sounds horrendous.
