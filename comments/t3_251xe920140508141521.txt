People keep objecting to the word 'make'.

Please note that I am not advising that OP tie her husband up, throw him in the car, and hold a gun to his head to talk to the therapist.

As I've noted many times in this thread, many people resist the notion of therapy at first, because they buy into the stigma that therapy acknowledges that their relationship is irrevocably broken and headed towards divorce, not realizing that it also exists to mend issues in relatively strong relationships, or provide tools to couples struggling to communicate for whatever reason.

When I say 'make', I mean ask hubbie nicely to try it once, explaining what you hope to get out of it. And tell him that if he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to continue to go. That's it.
