I've read on the internet (so it must be true) that in many cases it's difficult to keep the developmentally disabled from having sex with each other, and that when it happens there's almost never protection. With the same basic hormones they will typically have the same basic drives, but that doesn't mean they know how to act on them safely. 

Add in the fact that they may have been sexually abused by someone at some point (as an easy target) and it's entirely possible to have rampant STDs and pregnancy. Not exactly an ideal scenario.
