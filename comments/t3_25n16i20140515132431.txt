Thank you for your post. I feel like I have, over and over again, and it'll seem like it's getting somewhere when we talk about her options, but she just doesn't want to take the plunge. She doesn't want to ask her boss for a livable wage and  isn't really searching for a new one, she won't room with anyone from craigslist or anyone she doesn't already know... She put up a post on facebook at one point searching for roommates, but took it down quickly after a day. I make sure she knows she has tons of options, I point out our friends who might want/know someone who needs a roommate, and my parents would probably even let her board if she *really* needed out and had nowhere else to go. She just doesn't want to jump.

>Tell her that you won't have this guy at your wedding or hanging out with you, and you won't attend her wedding if she marries him - that that is how strongly you feel about not wanting her to get into an even deeper hole with this guy. 

I think you're completely right on this. It's sure not going to be fun to say, but after all that this isn't okay for *me* anymore.
