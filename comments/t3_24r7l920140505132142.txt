Your gynecologist got angry at you?? What the hell? That is inexcusable. You are so young, were in obvious discomfort, and were in about the most vulnerable position you could be in at a doctor's office. He needs to find a new career if he can't maintain a professional, helpful demeanor and take his patients' concerns seriously. Jesus. I would be absolutely furious if I were treated that way.
