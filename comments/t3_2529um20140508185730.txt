She's not looking for a reason, she's asking how *she* can get over it. Nothing at all with the guy doing anything wrong. You're not getting it at all.

So to recap: OP is looking for how to build her confidence back up, *not explanations* as to why it happened. She knows why it happened. She's upset that she didn't notice the issue, not that he was some big jerk.
