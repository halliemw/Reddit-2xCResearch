Dont worry to much about it in the mean time. Its quite likley that you are stressing out over nothing. Cycles can be strange and vary for all sorts of reasons. Its just a good idea to rule out pregnancy since its so easy to test for. 

(pro tip: take the test, if you can, on your first pee of the day as the HCG that the test measures to give a +ve result will be at its most concentrated then)
