1.) When you live in your parents' home, you live according to their belief system. If your parents are very conservative, you know what that means and you live accordingly. Your cousin should have given you a heads-up about the policy in her home. (She may not have been aware that it would be a problem for you.)

2.) I have come to believe that some monitoring of your offsprings' electronic communications is not only acceptable, but in fact expectable parental protection in this day and age. True, OP's cousin is 18; but she has led a very sheltered life. Not only is monitoring part of her family's value system, it could protect her from being horribly exploited. 

3.) If you fail to reach out to your cousin because now this is all about YOU and what happened to YOU, then you are reacting very poorly, IMO. She is still an 18-year-old having a hard time. Have your upset (although the "they violated my privacy!" thing is a little much, under the circumstances. At 26 do you not understand that electronic privacy communication does not exist, particularly in conservative homes?), get over being upset, have a conversation with your aunt and uncle about it like a big girl, and continue to support your cousin however you can. If your aunt and uncle prohibit her from communicating with you because of all this, that is their decision (naturally I think it would be a terrible mistake, but it would be their decision).
