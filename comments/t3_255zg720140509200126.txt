I'm definitely doing stuff for my son as well - I have some letters for him, and some other writing. :)  I was asking about my daughter specifically because of the audience here, and because I was raised with only brothers (I'm the oldest).  

I'm relatively comfortable with how and what I'm talking to him about, but I am much more in the dark about what to tell my daughter when.  I also am comfortable with knowing my brothers will be there to help my son with a lot of the questions he has (especially regarding sex, although I have already had the first talk with him).  I am less comfortable with who will be there for my daughter, although I have spoken to close family friends and asked them to be there for her (in addition to my wife and her sister) as she needs. 

I'm so jealous of you getting to see your daughter as she enters her teens.  I can see these glimpses of the woman my daughter will one day be, and I so want to be there to see it (as I want to see the man my son will become one day).  

I hear co-workers complain about their teens and it makes me crazy: I would give anything to deal with sullenness, the anger, the emotional ups and downs of teens, if only to see them as they truly begin to discover themselves. 

Do me a favor and give them both a hug out of nowhere today, and tell them you love them.
