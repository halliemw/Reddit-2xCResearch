That is honestly truly awful. I completely understand why you feel uncomfortable—I have no idea what I'd do in a situation like that, because what the fuck, who does a thing like that. 

You and your classmates might just be students, but for a tutor the classroom is their workplace. Nobody should be subjected to something like that when they're just trying to do their job. Please do raise it with your professor, student services personnel, or department head. They should be aware that shit like that is going on in their classrooms. 

As for your classmates—you *should* think less of them, because it's a really disgusting thing to do. Just steer clear of those people at all costs, and don't instigate anything with them. The university should handle it.
