> Did I mention kid #1 didn't sleep? I mean Didn't sleep. Would sleep 2 hours in a 24 hour period...

Not to backseat parent, but I didn't sleep through the night until I was 18 months old, and it turns out I had two sleep disorders (apnea and periodic limb movement disorder). 

I never really slept much (around 3-4 hours a night, usually) until I was sixteen years old and got diagnosed, but once I was a few years old, my parents didn't *know* I still wasn't sleeping. You might want to think about having a sleep study done on the kid, it really changed my life for the better.
