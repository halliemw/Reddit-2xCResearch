Maybe because the victims are 18-22, have no experience working with a legal system, and have been encouraged by every authority around them (their RA, their residence dean, the on campus counseling staff) to go through campus authorities? Because they trusted the university to handle the matter and involve the police if necessary?

A freshman is MUCH more likely to turn to her RA as the first step. If she gets bad advice at that point, I don't see how it's her fault.
