I was 19, and it was with my second long term boyfriend.  I don't remember much about it to be honest. (I'm 33 now)  If you're worried about regretting losing it with this guy, I would look at what it is that's making you think you might, and use that as a guide.  If it's just that you're worried it won't be perfect, well... it's never perfect!  But if there's something about the guy- perhaps a strong reason why you'd never be more than FWB with him- then maybe it'd be better for you to wait.  Good luck!
