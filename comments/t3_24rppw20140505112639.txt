Everybody in this thread should be ashamed of themselves.  This is just like a Christian fanatic looking pictures of a gay marriage and saying things like its "weird" or "creepy."  Look, this is those people's culture.  They have a different view of sexual morality than you do. As long as they don't impose it on you, why don't you stop judging and belitting them?
