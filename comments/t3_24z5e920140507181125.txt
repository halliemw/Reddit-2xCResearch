As someone who is 37 and is always mistaken for being much younger (short, slight stature, chubby cheeks, baby face, high voice), I've found that it's really important to believe in your own value and your own expertise. It sounds cheesy, but it's true. You have to "sell" the vision of yourself you want people to see. You need to believe it in order to sell it. 

Dressing a little more conservatively can help age you up a bit, but I'd focus on your demeanor more. Some ideas:

Do you stand up straight or do you slouch? Be physically big, if you can. Stand tall and keep your body language open and confident (no crossing arms, hunching over, head down, fiddling with hair/ clothes). It's not something people consciously pick up on, but it's a way to convey that you feel capable in your workplace. 

Do you use a lot of "uh" "um" "like" "you know" or any other sort of valley girlish filler words? This is definitely something that makes people think you are younger or less confident in what you are saying. Also check for ending statements with an uptilt in your voice (makes them sound like questions). Try to weed these words/ tics out of your work vocabulary. It's better to be silent for a minute and gather your thoughts than say, "Well, it's like, you know, the spreadsheet was supposed to be delivered on, uh, Thursday?"
