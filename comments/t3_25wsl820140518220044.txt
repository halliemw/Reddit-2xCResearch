Ugh, thank you so much. I'm really hoping that it's just last month's period making an appearance, but it was just a surprise and I'm a worrier.  I don't think it could be a sex injury since it's been over a month since I've had sex? But maybe. I'm glad you didn't mention cervical cancer haha. (I admit: I googled)
