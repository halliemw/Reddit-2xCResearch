It's a bit harder in Germany. "Cyberlaws" are not so well refined here and he did nothing really illegal as far as I know.

He only opened a "wishlist" on Amazon in my name and not an actual account. It was such a weird feature that Amazon used as a type of advertisement for its wishlist service when you for instance search for someone on http://www.yasni.de (which he did, I could reverse engineer his steps). 

When you search for someone over there that has no "open" Amazon account and wishlist (my Amazon account wisely uses a pseudonym and can't actually be Googled) Amazon apparently let's you create such a fake wishlist to nudge the person into creating a real one. It was quite weird. But exactly his style.

He then emailed me a third time in the same day (after research email and Amazon whishlist creation) to tell me - and here it comes - to better "guard my online presence" because if he can find my email addresses so easily "what bad person also could?!".

AHAHAHAHAHAHA. PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFR.

He is the *worst* online experience I have. And he tries to tell *me* to better be on guard for online predators. He, the one who cannot respect a professional research call, is trying to tell me to withdraw myself even more from the online world (which I'm painstakingly doing for years now - you almost can't Google me which is actually a bad idea if you want to work in the field of *online communication* in the future like I do). Is he fricken kidding me? He is pissing me off so much, people.
