When we talked in hypotheticals he was supportive of an abortion if I felt I couldn't be a parent. But when it actually happened he felt differently. I don't understand it myself, but feelings are pretty volatile so I'm trying to respect his while still having mine. 

Before this he was incredibly supportive and kind. I think he's just blindsided by emotions right now.
