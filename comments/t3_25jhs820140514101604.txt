That liking girlie things made me weaker as a person. Not just that others would judge me and think they knew all about me because I was adhering to gender stereotypes, but that it would make me weaker as an individual. 

I'm 28 now and have started to embrace that wearing make up or having pretty gel nails shouldn't change who I am. Nor should it cause people to dramatically alter their opinion of me.

Still a struggle though!
