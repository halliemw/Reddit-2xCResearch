It might, but if you view you against your boss as a competition, you're always going to be the loser (well, 99% of the time anyway).  The best thing you can do is find a job where you like your boss.  If your boss discriminates against you or you don't like your boss, you're going to end up hating your job and it will wear on you and even if you do 'win' you still won't really win.
