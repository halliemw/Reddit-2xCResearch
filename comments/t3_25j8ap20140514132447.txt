1. Generally it's a pro-choice place here. It doesn't mean that we're pro-abortion, but rather if a woman chooses to continue her pregnancy or not, we are supportive of her choice, and her right to make that choice. 

2. Civility is good.

3. Abortion is such a weighted issue. Generally when we think of women going for abortions we imagine accidents (through missed or inactive pills, faulty birth control) or recklessness, but it's a much wider issue. 

As many have already pointed out, not every pregnancy is a result of a woman choosing to have sex - rape is a good instance. 

Second, abortion and the right to an abortion doesn't just cover feasible feotuses - removing the right to abortion also affects women who require a non-feasible feotus to be removed, such as in the cases of incredible disformity which mean it would not survive outside of the uterus, or even dead feotuses. Take [this case](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741) as an example, which ultimately lead to the mother's death. The right to abort a child legally saves lives. 

Third, abortions will happen [anyway](http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/magnitude/en/) regardless of the legality of the practice. Isn't it better to safeguard women who for whatever reason do not want a child, and protect their lives?

But personally I agree with many of the sentiments offered already, that if I take reasonable precautions I have already chosen to not have a child as a result of sex, so your argument is moot. However, that does not mean that if I became pregnant I would choose an abortion - I would weigh up that decision if it arose, and I don't believe in forcing my opinion on others and wouldn't judge others (regardless of my personal beliefs) if they chose an abortion or to give the child up for adoption or raise it themselves. That's their choice as adult women.
