>  I have seen it many times where people either get drunk or say something they shouldn't have, or pretty much "take over" the bridal shower, and the other guests are unhappy with it, and that person gets uninvited to the wedding.


If you're going to do that, you need to have the guts to inform the person (tactfully, of course) why he or she has not been invited to the wedding.

> If she wants to assume she was sent an invitation that got list in the mail, then she doesn't actually need a formal invitation and the phone call is unnecessary.

So what is she supposed to do as an RSVP without a response card? Does she wait until the bride is pissed off that OP hasn't RSVPed yet and it's now 10 days until the wedding and the venue or caterer needs the final numbers for each meal selection?
