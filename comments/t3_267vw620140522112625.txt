I'm not on it, but I've been thinking about going on it and just went to the gyno on Friday to discuss it. She told me that every woman has a different experience with the implant as far as their periods go. 2 out of 10 will have constant spotting/breakthrough bleeding, and the other 8 really vary. She said some will be regular, some will stop getting their period altogether, and some will get it sporadically every few months. By gifts, do you mean full on period 3 times a month? Or spotting?

I'm not 100% decided yet on getting it because I was on a progesterone-only birth control (Erinn) and it gave me really terrible hormonal acne (as progest-only BC's can do). I went on Gianvi and Microgestin before to clear up my skin, and they did do that but after 4 months on each of them I began to get really bad hives. That's why I've been considering the implant. I have a friend who is on it and she said she doesn't get her period at all, so I figured that would probably help with my acne problem because I only break out the week before/after my period.
