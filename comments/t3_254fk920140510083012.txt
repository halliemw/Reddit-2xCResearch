Nope, this one: http://www.collectobil.com/catalogue/catalogue.html Click "Doll house", sorry I can't directly link to it. The funny thing is, that catalog doesn't even have all the info, as complete as it is. They don't show the original "Children's Bedroom" set that we had. Ours was in completely different colors (the bunk bed was blue, the girl wore a white and navy outfit, the train set was in primary colors) and there was no wardrobe and chair. It did come with a baby, baby cradle, nurse maid, and changing table/bathtub. The hobby horse was a brown rocking horse and it didn't come with the pram, only a doll. They also don't show in on that website that you could actually get an entire extra floor for the dollhouse, nor do they show how awesome it was on the inside.


*Edit: I'm talking about the first image in the set, not the second one. There's a mix of modern and old sets in that portion of the catalog, we had the sets that were released in the early nineties.
