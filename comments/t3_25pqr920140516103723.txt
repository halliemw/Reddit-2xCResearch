The way to take legal action is to go speak to an employment attorney.  That meeting is confidential and would not be known to her employer.  At that meeting, the attorney would advise whether or not this is an actionable situation.  If the lawyer decides it isn't, or they simply don't want the case, then she didn't risk her job at all because her employer wouldn't know about the meeting.

If the attorney does think it is actionable, then her company would find out and her job would be in a more precarious position.  That choice is hers obviously, but she needs to weigh those risks herself.

All in all though, if she wants a true legal opinion, it would be private and not risky.
