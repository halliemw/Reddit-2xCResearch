I quite like being alone and can comfortablely answer the question, "what did you do this weekend", with "nothing, it was great" (big smile).  "Nothing" isn't exactly true but most people don't really want to hear the minutia of my bike ride or experiments in the kitchen, the all night conversation I had with my best friend who lives far away, the tv shows I binged on, the half started projects that will never get finished, or reading a good book.

My job is pretty isolating too.  My boss is damn lucky to have found me because I don't think many people could survive in the conditions I work in.  It's pretty ideal for me though.  I rely heavily on my parents, my best friend, and a couple other long distance friends for interaction and most of that is just phone calls or texting.  I don't start to get really stir crazy until a couple of weeks or so without talking to someone.

Edit:  A word.
