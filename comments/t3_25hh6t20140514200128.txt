Yeah, my experience was similar (although actually, the "perp" in question did way less than the perp in your story).  I had a "maybe" in my response similar to yours - it did not go well.  

Neither of us was trying to defend the alleged evil-doer, but to inject some reasonable suggestions into the discussion.  

I'd need to have been there, furthermore (to see what the "butt-touching" really consisted of - given the explainer's admitted possible black-out/memory problems.  It was one of the things that amazed me most about drunk people, once I met some:  they remembered things so differently than I thought I'd seen.  We all can have imperfect memories, but over the years, I've grown to trust sober people's memories (and trained professionals) over drunk people.  

To me, advising women to avoid circumstances that endanger them is no different than telling people to wear good shoes with traction while climbing Half Dome.  It's supportive.  It's a good thing to do.  But it is also increasingly perceived as victim blame.  Usually, within feminist/women's communities that I've been in, both positions are tolerated.

When it comes to the smaller "assaults" (dissing someone's hairstyle, showing some weird bias against something that someone else likes), I think it's important to cut other people the slack we'd want for ourselves.  No one manages to avoid offending all other people.  Being able to shrug some stuff off (and set appropriate, usually polite, boundaries with others) is a good thing.  

I'm not much into faulting or blaming unless I'm on a jury or appointed to hear a grievance.  I hear complaints all day long (and it's amazing how widely different witnesses to the same event hear things).  I don't like playing judge or jury unless I have to, but I do think proactive assertiveness and judicious boundary setting are learned skills - ones we could discuss productively here.
