Maybe so. The other thing is we're probably not the target audience either - we were looking for adult merch and more elaborate stuff, not plastic trinkets (which we didn't see much of either though). Things like glass figurines and tree ornaments of which there were plenty with like Cinderella and Aurora but not much else...
