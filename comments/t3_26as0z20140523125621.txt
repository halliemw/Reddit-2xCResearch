Thanks. Maybe I should look into it again. I feel all kinds of conflicted about labor rights' issues, chemicals & the environment, immigration, and so-called pink ghettos. The kind of companies that can make me feel okay on all those issues tend to be pretty spendy. (no judgement implied. I just have issues lol) Edit: Same reason I don't own too many dry clean only clothes, the only dry cleaner that "works" for me is super expensive. #firstworldproblems
