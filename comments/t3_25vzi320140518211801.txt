If you're on good terms and can talk about this, try talking to your mom. I was going through a similar situation recently and I explained it to her and she was able to point me in the right direction without going to the doctor (Out of state for college, and not going to the untrustworthy campus center! The woes.).

But I took a one-day suppository and it cleared up right away. I used Monistat, and it's (maybe TMI) kinda like inserting a tampon but kinda grosser. You put it in before bed, wear a pantiliner in the event of leakage, and shower in the morning to clean up. Worked fine for me.

They make five- and seven-day ones too, and those are usually cheaper. They also sell them on amazon, too, so you don't have to be the awkward person buying yeast infection medicine in a store (That was my biggest concern).
