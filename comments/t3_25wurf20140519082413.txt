I have a similar problem but its kind of the opposite. I'm very selective in the people I choose to be close friends with. I'm friendly with everyone and I never push anybody away but I do keep a distance.

The reason is that people these days that grew up around social media is all about having many friends in quantity instead of quality.

I'm a person who would rather prefer one really good friend over several shallow friends.

That distinction is very clear to me. I know some people don't mind that which is fine but rise of Facebook has really pushed the spectrum towards that one side.
