AND .... got my first hate message from someone who doesn't think "feminist crap" belongs on Reddit and that I should just keep my legs closed. He must have an incredibly small brain, be 15 years old, and is NEVER getting any.

Edit: and should add -- I first went on BC in my late 20s to preserve my fertility/ovaries/health. I had dermoid tumors (the kind with teeth and hair) -- one that was splitting my right ovary in half, and two on the left side that neither an ultrasound or pelvic exam detected. Going on Depo at the time to prevent ovulation = preventing more dermoids. At this point, I also am looking at BC as a way to deal with this crappy perimenopausal stuff that is going on, too. So to the idiot that sent that message, too bad you are so ignorant as to not know there are other reasons to take BC.
