I don't think people get this, about being bi. If you are with a guy, you are seen as straight. If you are with a girl, you are seen as gay. If you are with an opposite gender person, you are excluded from the gay community and if you are with a same gender person, you are excluded from the straight community. Now that I'm married, I feel like I don't belong in the LGBT community anymore.
