I've been on the Mirena for over a year now. My periods, for the first 4-5 months after I got it put in, were very irregular (less than a month between them, then almost two, that sort of thing), though not longer/heavier than before (I used to get a fairly long and heavy period before the Mirena, though). Towards the end of the first 6 months, I started getting barely any period, then it disappeared entirely. I don't think two months is long enough to see how your body reacts to the Mirena. I'd suggest that, unless you experience any really unusual symptoms, to give it 6-12 months to really settle in.
