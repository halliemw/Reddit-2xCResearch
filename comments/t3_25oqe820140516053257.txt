That's a large component in what feminism generally terms rape culture.  The cultural belief that rape should be laughed at (see the horrifying number of rape jokes and prison rape jokes), ignored, minimized, dismissed, apologized for and excused.  What were you wearing?  Have you ever had sex before?  Was it rape rape or just kind of rape?  You just regretted having sex and tried to call it rape, right?  Feh.

Rape culture is real and a major component of our culture, and one of the most depressing things is how outraged, defensive, and dismissive people get when they even hear the term.
