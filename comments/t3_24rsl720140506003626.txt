I "should have" lost my "virginity" to the guy I was dating at 16, but we broke up and never had PIV sex. I actually had PIV sex for the first time with a friend when I was 18. The sex sucked, but that was independent of the fact that it was my first time. It was just bad sex, no real romantic connection. I did it for all the wrong reasons - mainly because I was curious to see if PIV sex was "all that" and if I was missing out. Some of it was because I had been having oral & manual sex for years and was sick of being called a "virgin". 

Anyway, fast forward. I did end up having sex with that guy I dated at 16. It took until my 20's, but it happened. And you know what? It *felt* like my first time. It felt like the sex we never had before. Even though I had years of sexual experience at that point, even though he did too... "loosing your virginity" is a state of mind. This probably makes no sense to anyone else, but for me it was like being in a time machine. 

Every single time you have sex has the potential to be amazing, intimate, and life changing. Or it can just be sex. There is NOTHING inherently special or different about your first time. There is also nothing inherently different between PIV sex and oral or manual sex. They all come with different degrees of intimacy. 

I think that if you want it, you should go for it. The sex you have in the future with a man you love will still be amazing.
