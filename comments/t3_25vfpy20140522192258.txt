You're comparing getting an abortion to having to wear a uniform every day at work. The situation is different because it's not the surrogates decision to make, and that's spelled out in her contract. 

Let me try to put it another way. What if you take your dog to the vet to be put down. It's injured and in pain. The vet signs a contract saying that they'll do the humane thing and put the dog to sleep. Then without your permission they give the dog to someone else. The dog has to live being partially crippled and in pain. Wasn't it your decision to make to put the dog, YOUR dog, down? Would you defend the vet because it was his right to choose whether the dog lives or dies? Especially after he signed a contract promising to abide by your wishes?
