Unfortunately this director's boss (a global VP) has been heavily engaged in some acquisition stuff for the past year, so he is largely hands-off. My guess is that the director's behavior has not been observed by the VP, and that no one has been willing to report the director yet. Time to get the VP's attention. I have a good relationship with the VP and know he will hear me and take me seriously - and take action. 

If he doesn't, I will honestly be very surprised. And will be looking for another job pronto. I can't advance my career at the company I'm at while this sr director has the job that he does.
