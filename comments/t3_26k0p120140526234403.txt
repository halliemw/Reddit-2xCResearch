I'm so sorry. This sounds so much like my ex, who later confessed he hadn't really been in love with me for years. He would never answer his phone when at his friends' and I was never invited to come along. I also found out close to our wedding that a woman in that group had fallen in love with him and none of his friends would be there because she was so upset. So, Nome of his friends were even in the wedding, that he later told me he regretted. 

I hope your situation turns out much better!
