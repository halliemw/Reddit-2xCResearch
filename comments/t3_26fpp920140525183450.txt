Make sure you are lubricated amply before allowing penetration. My boyfriend is well-girthed and we had a bit of trouble with it (the stinging/ripping feeling sounds about right). Also make sure the angle isn't an issue. I'm more sensitive around the lower opening and we had to adjust to that because of his girth. I hope it's as easy as that, but good luck fixing the issue! I know how frustrating and upsetting unsuccessful sex can be.
