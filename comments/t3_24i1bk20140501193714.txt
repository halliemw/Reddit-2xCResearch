You know honestly, I had to look for it. Not for too long but like "huh, she said she had a mole on her face, where is... oh, there." It's definitely not distracting. I even think it's kind of cute! The thing is that what other people see when they look at you is really different from what you see when you look in the mirror, for all kinds of reasons. That said, I think if you want to have it removed you should do so. We can't know what it will look like but it sounds like you might rather be referred to as "that girl with the scar on her chin" than "that girl with the mole on her chin." Are there any other risks to consider? Would this be the kind of surgery that would require GA, for example?
