Coming from a guy who for some reason started reading posts on this subreddit, I can try to give my terrible advice. Try to initiate conversation if you run into somebody who seems like your type. It seems like too often guys are expected to start up a conversation, but sometimes all I want is for that girl to come up to me and tell me my sandals are nice(they're not) or my car is cool (it isn't). Not sure if its the best, or even decent advice, but there you are.
