Do you not pluck usually?

I find it so interesting when people say it hurts so bad they cry. My face is numb to all tweeting now, but even in the beginning it wasn't awful. 

When I do the eyebrow manscaping for my friends they're eyes weep. I just assumed it was they did it so infrequently. I've never heard a woman complain.
