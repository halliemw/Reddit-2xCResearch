Just got off NuvaRing myself. Was on it for like half a year. Now, I have no idea if it was because of Nuva, but I had two breakdowns that scared even myself. I was a crying mess, and since I've gotten off of birth control in general, I haven't had a hysterical crying episode since. 10/10, would quit birth control again ;)
