If you can, also try and find a doctor/clinic online that specifically says it specializes in dealing with vaginal pain disorders.  The reason being is that pain during sex can be caused by sooo many different things and there are a lot of gynos out there who try and treat it generically.

My university's gyno, for example, tried to treat it with an antidepressant, which is considered a very generic/first line treatment.  I eventually decided to drive an hour away to see a gyno that specialized in these conditions.  SO worth it.  She discovered my pain is the result of too much muscle tension, something that would be managed but not fully treated with antidepressants.  Now, under her orders, I see a special physical therapist and have made huge advancements toward pain-free sex.

Good luck!
