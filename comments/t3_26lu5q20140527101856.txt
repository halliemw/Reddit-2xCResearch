The struggle is always going to be there though, the pressure will always be around you no matter at what size.  You should prioritize happiness most of all.  It isn't a failure at all if you're satisfied and happy with your life. 

Would you be willing to give yourself a test run, on how much it would take to get to where you want to go?   I was 20 lbs heavier at one point, which is a lot on someone that is 5'0, but I decided that I would rather lose the weight since I'd get much more enjoyment out of being thinner.  Once the weight was gone (according to Google, I am a touch under 7 stone), the maintenance was easy, so long as you're moderately active (marathonning not needed) and don't end up going on massive buffet benders.  I eat well (e.g. I still eat chips, fries, and all that other bad stuff) but I am consciously exercising or balancing with lighter meals after big meals, and that's all it takes for me personally!
