Seriously, a rapist isn't going to fight fair.  They're also not going to go to the cops if you tase them.  Barracuda stun guns are awesome.  They're small enough that you can conceal them in your hand pretty easily, make a loud warning noise, have the ability to drop people in just a 4 second touch, and have a bracelet that disables the taser if it gets taken away from you during an altercation.

Also, don't stab someone with your keys.  They have these cat things.

It won't fuck up your hand like keys.
