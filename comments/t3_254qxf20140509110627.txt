Genitals and the skin around them tend to be a different color than the skin on the rest of our bodies. If you're noticing a change in color or texture of your skin, it would probably be good to visit a doc and see what's going on. Probably just something normal like hyperpigmentation or irritation of the skin. 

Also keep in mind that if you're like most people, 99.9% of the people you know will NEVER see the inner part of your butt cheeks. Frankly, most of them don't care what the inside of your butt looks like. Hopefully that can help you put the appearance of that part of your body in perspective :)
