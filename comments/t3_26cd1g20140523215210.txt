That last bit may be reassuring. While I will never have my own children, I have delightfully spoiled nieces and nephews that I can tell.

I have stories of my Gram's gram as well to pass along, stories my Gram has told me. I really wish she would have written them down for me before all this. I want to make sure that I get all of the names right.
