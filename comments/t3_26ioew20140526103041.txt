I've asked my favorite soul singer, Sharon Jones, a similar question during her AMA (how I, an 18 year old, could become as strong as she is), and this was her answer:

> "Just respect yourself. You have to love yourself, have faith in yourself and that way you won't take mess from no one else. A lot of these young girls get manipulated by these young guys by them just telling them "you aren't this or that" and controlling them. Just love yourself and know your worth. Don't settle for less. Some kids may not be raised around someone who's strong. My father was abusive to my mother, but my mother left him. My mother showed me her strength. I knew she was a strong woman raising 6 kids by herself. As far as self-respect and being strong, it was her."

I hope this will inspire you as much as it inspired me! :) 

edit: I've just figured out how to quote something, yay
