I mean take dating completely off the table until you sort things out, even if you find someone interesting.  Not that you are in anyway unloveable, but you are not in a good place to get in a healthy relationship.  This is the kind of state that will push good people away and attract bad people.  

Are there other counseling options?  NHS?  Can your current one give referrals?  Counseling can make you feel worse in the short time as they try to get to deeper roots of the issues.  

Things you can think about - moving your locus of control to inside instead of the outside.  Connecting with yourself and actually learning to love yourself in a way that jerks like your friend, who was not really your friend, can't tear down.  Cutting out the negative self-talk.  

Writing down a list of things that you like about yourself and adding to it every day is a good start.  Set some reasonable goals every day/week.  Exercise releases happy chemicals in the brain.  Get enough sleep.  Mindfulness meditation and yoga helped me out immensely.
