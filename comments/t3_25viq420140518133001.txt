My half sister and I look so alike people ask if we are twins. I don't know why it would be a problem that sisters look alike either. Also, I don't know why it always disturbs me when so much is put into "evil" Disney. I just watch those damn movies because they are cute and visually stunning a lot of the times. And good music. Maybe it just never influenced me.
