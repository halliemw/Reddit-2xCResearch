Is he sexist in general or just to you? If you can figure out his motivations then you'll be in better stead to respond effectively.
Edit: for those downvoting, I'm not advocating his behaviour in any way, but the fact is that if he is only sexist to OP, and not to other women, then there is some other issue that could possibly be addressed, improving the situation for everybody. If he is sexist in general then it is unlikely that he will change his attitude, so, for example, reasonable explanations of why he's wrong wont be effective. OP will have an easier time of combatting him if she understands his motivations.
