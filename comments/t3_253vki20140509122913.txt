yep, this. 

i was once on a bus where the guy in front of me was harassing the woman in front of him. she was trying to ignore him, he was being aggressive and sexual and racist(?!?). i'm a short girl and not at all physically intimidating. so i went up and reported gross guy to the (big, black, dude) bus driver. he was kicked off, the bus driver ended up calling the cops bc of how he reacted to being kicked off, and the rest of us were all happy to have him gone.
