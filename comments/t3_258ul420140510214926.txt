Man, that is so different from where I live, we learned about sexual reproduction in grade school. In Middle school we went in to detail, they showed us how to properly use condoms, they stressed safe sex, the scared us with pictures of STD's and such, my health final in 8th grade was to take care of a realistic baby dole. They were programmed to cry and you had to do things like rock them and feed them. It was a baby simulation, they gave it to us for 2 days and it recorded how well we took care of it's needs. We also had a program called, S.T.A.R.S, students today aren't ready for sex. They preached abstinence but not in a bad way it was more to reinforce that wait til after High school when you are ready, a kind if you are not mature enough to raise a child than you are probably not mature enough to practice safe sex. They wanted us to be responsible and they wanted us to know that sex is not bad or dirty it's a natural Human experience. They even handed out condoms in the health office.
