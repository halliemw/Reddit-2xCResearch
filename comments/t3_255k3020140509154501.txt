Tend Skin is where it's at. Also, [Amlactin lotion](http://pics1.ds-static.com/prodimg/16752/300.jpg) is good for Keratosis Pilaris if that's making your ingrown hairs worse. Anecdotally, I've heard that exfoliating a little *less often* can help - like every three days instead of every day, though YMMV. If you have an ingrown, if you can get it out from under the skin, "free" it, but don't tweeze it for a couple days until the surrounding skin has had a chance to heal.

Also, if you're a popper/picker/squeezer/tweezer... definitely don't check out /r/popping....... (and actually don't check it out if you have a weak stomach).
