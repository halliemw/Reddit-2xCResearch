>Imagine that in another context. "No, not all blacks are engaged in street crime, but all whites have to navigate a world where those who are look the same as those who aren't."

No, it's more like "Not cops are trying to ticket/imprison you for profit, but all minorities have to navigate a world where those who are look the same as those who don't."

You have failed to understand that men still have the upper hand in society and that there is a physical power difference. So in your example, if the black men were given more credibilty than whites and if they were physically bigger and stronger than whites on average, then you'd have a point. 

>Oh look, downvotes. What was that about people needing to listen more and to not be defensive? Oh wait, that's just for men hearing women's arguments. Not vice versa.

I'm sorry you feel marginalized, but do you realize that's how women feel pretty much EVERYWHERE else on Reddit, not to mention real life? And you might not have realized your analogy was completely wrong and didn't add to the discussion but instead invalidated the experiences of women. But it was and it did. 

Women know not all men are rapists. But that doesn't change the fact that we're regularly sexually harrassed, sexually assulted, and everyone knows women who have been raped. Just because some men are decent humans, doesn't change the discussion pertaining to those that aren't. And often, those that would never dream of doing such a thing, assist or add to the culture that it's okay. I recently talked to someone who was mentioning a friend of theirs that drugged women in bars. He's an intelligent man, but did not put it together that his friend was RAPING these women.
