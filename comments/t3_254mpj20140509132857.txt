Oh, I'm so sorry that happened.

When I had my kids by c-section and was recovering in hospital (I was there for five days; anaemia), they had these big square mattress pads that they just put under my butt. I had a catheter too until the drugs had worn off enough for me to get up by myself, so the pad absorbed everything else. And the nurses were so kind and aware of the embarrassment! It's so unfair that nurses of all people were so insensitive for you.
