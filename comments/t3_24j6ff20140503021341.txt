My mom was a strong, successful businesswoman who reached the highest ranks at her male-dominated company. I can't even begin tell you what a positive influence it's had on my life, my goals, and my conception of what women are capable of/deserving of in this world, even from the time that I was a child. Having a strong woman as a role model is so important. Kudos to you and your husband.
