I have plenty of festival experience and this really depends on the atmosphere and the type of people attending. I personally have been fine after dark walking by myself, even completely fucked up. But then again, most of my festival experiences have been at hippy festivals and a lot of people are looking out for each other. The worst that ever happened was super fucked up guys crawling into the wrong tent at night. But then being thrown out without too much of a fuss being made. 

I'd say you really have to gauge how it is once you get there. Probably better to err on the side of caution though, all it takes is one scumbag.
