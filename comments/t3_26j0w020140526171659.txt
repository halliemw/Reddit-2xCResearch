I think that your sentiment is beautiful and eloquent. But in light of what your commenting on, it's in pretty bad taste. Yes, people should show more empathy for one another. No one should be a jerk, or humiliate people on a whim. 

But in a way, your comment is saying that you can understand why he was driven to this. You are saying that when women are cruel in their rejections, that you can see how this might drive someone to mass murder. 

I understand completely that you are not saying that you would do this. But you are saying that when women are cruel towards their suitors, this might be expected. 

I'd like to clarify by saying that I understand that women should try to be empathetic and kind when they reasonably can, when they are rejecting potential suitors, and people in genral should be kind to one another. But your claiming that there should be "repercussions" for a woman, if she calls a man who shows interest in her a "loser" is incredibly worrying, to say the least.
