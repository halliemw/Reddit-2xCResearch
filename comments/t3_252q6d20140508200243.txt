>We are reading all of the community input. 

I have heard this. Repeatedly. I'm saying for me this statement is not enough without some visible action.

>We are doing our best to address individual concerns as best we can.

How? In detail. Something more substantive than replying to individual posts.

I'll say this again: Address the poll that was already taken. More than 10,000 votes against 2X as a default and a 10:5:1 ratio against:neutral:favorable. Your comment above seems to imply you're dismissing that as an unfair vote.

>Meanwhile people who are satisfied with the changes or simply don't care, don't comment.

Actually I've seen multiple threads in favor of the change. This is why I think you should have had a more organized debate. Or, perhaps more relevant, that you should have an organized debate in 1-2 weeks time.
