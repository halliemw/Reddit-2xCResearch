Please please please bring this up with her. I started mine at 9, too. 

I was super under prepared for it. I didn't know that tampons existed. I didn't know the difference between pads and panty-liners. 

It's good that she already has a general idea of it, but *please* start talking to her about it now so she's not scared or freaked out when it does happen. 

It'd also be a good thing to make sure she knows that not everyone is the same when it comes to periods. Hers might end up being shorter, or longer than someone else's. Clotting is also something you'll want to tell her, because the first time I noticed it, I thought I was dying. Same for when I had the brown, not quite blood, stuff.
