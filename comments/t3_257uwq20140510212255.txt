Edit:  I don't think it's smart to start using the thought process that "if a problem affects one gender, it's solely that gender's issue to deal with."

It may be his problem, but the school has a responsibility to improve the test scores of all of its students, including him.  If dress codes disproportionately affect the test scores of one gender, the school still has a responsibility to do what it can to improve those scores.  Fundamentally, education is a higher priority than freedom of expression in schools, including expression through fashion.

That said, I doubt yoga pants actually have much of an effect of anything in reality, so I don't think banning them would have a material affect on test scores.
