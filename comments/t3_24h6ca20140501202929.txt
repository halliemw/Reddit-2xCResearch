For whatever it is worth, my IUD was a lot cheaper than my pill, which I was paying upwards of $60 for every month.  My IUD cost me $15.00 for five years of birth control.  It did stop my period, too.  However I can understand the fear of the unknown.  

Thanks to the ACA I think most insurance now covers the IUD at 100%
