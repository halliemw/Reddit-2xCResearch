> And trying to online date is a nightmare, seeing the "horror stories" people post about ending up on dates with fat people have just made me just too scared to even admit when I'm attracted to someone. I don't want to be someone's "horror story".

These "horror stories" usually happen because the person flat out lied about their body size, and took really deceiving pictures. Don't do this. If you're really worried about this, make sure you have full body shots up.
