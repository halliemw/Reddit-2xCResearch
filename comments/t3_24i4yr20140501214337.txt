Wow I have the opposite opinion. I love moving !! Exploring new places, a new community, a new vibe. Redecorating, waking up to new sights and smells. It's one of my favorite things!! 

All the feelings you have are normal but this is a new chapter and that is freaking exciting no matter how you look at it ! You can still go for walks, to parks, find new routes. Introduce yourself to neighbors! Find a new local grocery store! Haha I'm excited for you :)
