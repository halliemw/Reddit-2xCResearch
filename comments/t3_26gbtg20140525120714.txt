You should never feel coerced into having sex. I dunno legalities but from a moral standpoint, coercing a girl into sleeping with you when she otherwise wouldn't...that sounds like anti-choice to me. 

Why the fuck would a guy wanna sleep with a girl when he knows she's not feeling him? That seems rapey to me... 

Stay away from that dude. You're better than that, girl!
