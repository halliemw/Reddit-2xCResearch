I don't think "I'm tired" and crying are on the same level though. "I'm tired" is often uttered by men and women, and being in a relationship I've often found the partner to then turn the ship around with a relaxing massage etc. that leads to more... or not, as it can really mean "too tired", full stop. Being aware of the feelings of the other, the context, the situation, and being sensible to that is the key here.

What OP described however sounded completely different. If someone cries and the other person continues, that's just crazy, and the active partner was completely ignoring the feeling. It's mind-blowing.
