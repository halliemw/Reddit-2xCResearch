The guy was an entitled and megalomaniacal dickbag.  His rants took the form of misogyny, but the core traits here are those.  He felt the world owed him something and felt that he was more important/better than the other people around him.

If you listen to his rants, he's not just pissed at women for not fucking him.  He's pissed at the guys who ARE having sex because they're obviously less worthy of attention than he is.  Everything he ranted about indicates that he had an over-inflated sense of self-worth and an ego the size of Manhattan.

His "sickness" isn't misogyny though, and it's shamefully opportunistic of Laci to use this tragedy to push her cause.  He could have just as easily been pissed about rich people, or pissed that he wasn't making enough money, or pissed that no one recognized his intelligence.
