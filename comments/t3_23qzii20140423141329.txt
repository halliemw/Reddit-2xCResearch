I wonder if there are other things going wrong in his life? Maybe he's depressed either due to not wanting to continue the relationship or something else that's making him deal with things badly by burning bridges and binge drinking.

Either way, as hard as it is, if he's choosing to act this way, you're not going to be able to "fix" him, particularly if he's not looking for help. You're better off going your separate ways. You do not need him to live or be happy. Keep your chin up.
