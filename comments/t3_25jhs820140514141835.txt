Could you recommend any self-help books that worked for you? I remember getting a lot of "JUST BE BETTER" types of "self-help" literature when I was in my teens from well-meaning family members. They annoyed me and made me want to act out even more than I already was. Now that I'm older and conscious of that un-learning process you mentioned, I'd love to get my hands on some good self-help books.

I'm so glad you found a way to do you, go on and get it girl!
