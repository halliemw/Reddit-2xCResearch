Heck yeah, if you can get someone to do it for you, more power to ya. BTW you don't really need physical strength to get the lug nuts off of the wheel. Position the lug wrench handle on the left side of the nut and just *stand* on it, it will usually come loose. If not then just kinda bounce up and down. The actual hard part is getting the jack positioned properly and getting the car's weight off of the tire. 

I just realized that I drive a car that has no spare tire. So if I get a flat I'm screwed regardless.
