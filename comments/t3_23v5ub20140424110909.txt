Honestly, in some ways I am grateful for how awful T and W have been to me because it's affirmed that I made the right choice. They're definitely out of my life, other than a lunch on the day I graduated I haven't seen or spoken to W much since she and T started dating, and #2 didn't like that I was still friendly with T when our relationship began so I had cut of contact with him a long time ago.

There are a couple of reasons I am trying to keep my job searching local to what I call "home" which is really both my home town where I'll be moving in with my parents, as well as my university town that's about an hour away from home town. One is that I did reach out to an old friend who I wasn't allowed to talk to while dating #2 and found out that the group of friends I stopped hanging out with after splitting with T were totally on my side in regards to all of that, and I want to force myself to be more social and get back into the group that I was, if nothing else, able to really have a good time with. Two is because I have no savings whatsoever. Three is because I do have some long term plans to apply to graduate programs quite far away from home that I would hopefully be starting Fall of next year, if I were to get accepted. 

It's like I'm teetering on the brink of not giving a fuck and living my life, but I can't get over the last bit. The competitive feelings of knowing that W just defended her thesis for her masters and is already accepted into a terminal degree program of the same sort I want to apply for soon, plus is engaged to marry the dude I married already and is all set up to have her perfect happy life. Getting over the fact that none of that matters to me is hard.
