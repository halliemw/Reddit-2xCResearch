As a guy, I've noticed this. It seems to happen most with women like OP, who admitted that she doesn't really "get" guy conversations, so when she tries to interject she may not be contributing to the conversation. Male friends and I have done this to women and while we don't discuss it, I notice it and assume the other guys do as well, and I've had women do the same to me when it's a group talking and I'm the only guy. Or sometimes women (and men) have trouble finding the appropriate time to contribute.
