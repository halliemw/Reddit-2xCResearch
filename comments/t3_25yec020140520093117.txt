Okay, Grandma here.  My friend invites me to a party for her daughter who has recently graduated from college.  I take time from my life to attend the party, after having bought a card and included a nice cash gift.  I am happy for my friend.  I am happy for her daughter.  I arrive at the party, have a little food, have a glass of wine, try to make polite conversation with the graduate and BAM! I find myself in the middle of a lecture.  I try to bring the conversation back to the social level with an anecdote and a joke and she's off again.  I am wondering how I can escape and why I bothered with a gift. Then, I remember the passion and the newness of knowledge and try to be tolerant.  I also realize that the English graduate should have spent less time on outrage and more on grammar and wonder what on earth she's going to do to earn a living.  Maybe my check should have been larger.
