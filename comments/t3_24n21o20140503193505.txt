But why oh why would you be patronizing to somebody who came in and, instead of just asking for further clarification on what constitutes sexual harassment (or fucking googling it), had to go a step further and tell us that calling your coworkers whores and detailing their alleged sexual acts with customers is TOTALLY not sexual harassment and is ONLY being a jerk...

/s, obvs.
