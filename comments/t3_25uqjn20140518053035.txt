Yuck. What is wrong with some men? Some seem to think there is a power dynamic in play and they can act inappropriately when they are a customer and you are there to help them. 

I would get a cheap cz ring to wear at work so it looks like you are engaged which should cut down on some of the harassment. 

I wouldn't laugh, esp with the creepers even though it can be hard not to. As women we are conditioned to think of other peoples feelings and not wanting to make things awkward. An unamused stare and reverting back to the job at hand should shut them down. If it does't then a simple "I am here to work. I don't discuss my personal details with strangers/customers".

It is gross and embarrassing when men do this while you are at work. It is always the total knob ends that do it as well. You have my full sympathy.

One place I worked none of the female employees would have any phone numbers on their business cards due to the problems it caused with customers harassing them. Not a problem for the guys.
