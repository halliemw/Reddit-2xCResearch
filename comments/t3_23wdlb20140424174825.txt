I feel like that article totally missed the medical issue help that women are being denied in America. While the American issues raised by the writer seem trivial next to the Global issues raised, choosing to ignore that there are being laws passed that deny women the right to simple things like abortion, contraceptives, and without the latest from Tenessee. 

I'm British, so I can't really comment properly on this, but it seems you American Ladies have some truly serious issues going on that aren't "gendered toys from McD's."
