I hear ya. I don't want to be dismissive about his concerns, which is why I came to an unbiased source to see if I'm just being stubborn about this whole thing. 

To be perfectly honest, I don't give two shits whether or not he's personally bothered by my idea to add another tattoo to my body. If he wanted to get a back piece of Reptar, I couldn't and wouldn't care less. 

However, if his concerns for me having a hard time getting hired somewhere for having said tattoo, then that concerns me as well. I want to be able to contribute to and provide for our family after my stay in the military, and if something as simple as a tattoo will prevent me from doing so, I don't want to go through with it.
