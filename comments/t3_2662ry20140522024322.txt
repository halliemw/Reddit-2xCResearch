Completely normal. My first high school gf bled--a lot the first month or so since she lost her virginity. I think the second time we had sex I still had my white shirt on and by the time we finished the lower part of the front of my shirt was fully red. It was also very painful to her (and do to our varying physiology almost always painful the first few minutes of sex even after extensive foreplay).

Pro-tip: once you get the penis inserted and it's still painful but tolerable try having your bf not move, just let him be inside you for a few minutes (do thing like kiss or kegels) and very slow start going at it--it may help like it helped my ex.
