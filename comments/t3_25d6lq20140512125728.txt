Great! I feel like a missionary for that book, haha, but it really is helpful. I am currently rereading it. I hope you get as much out of it as I have!

I saw your replies to others about the proposal; sorry I didn't see them before I posted. Despite my less climactic proposal, I think the surprise-traditional ones can be super adorable too! It sounds like you both have really communicated what you want, which is the awesomest kind of sweet in my book.

The engagement/wedding process is full of feels, both highs and lows; don't be afraid to experience all of them. Just remember there isn't one right way for things to be, and however it happens with you and your boyfriend is exactly the way it should be for you! Let other people have their experiences, but primarily honor your own. Because that's all you got!
