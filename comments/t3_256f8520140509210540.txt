Something by Margaret Atwood!!! The Handmaid's Tale is fantastic. It's more Real Literature.

The Abhorsen series by Garth Nix is a fantasy fiction trilogy that's significantly longer than the Hunger Game trilogy.

There's also the Divergent trilogy, which is also being made into movies now, so that's fun. I'd say little reread potential there, though. And the Song of the Lionness series by Tamora Pierce, which is all kinds of awesome.
