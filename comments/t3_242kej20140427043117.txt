I watch a lot of Netflix. 

I try to see friends about 2-3 times a week, and aim to do something social for one day on the weekend. I also like going to museums and art galleries, and taking photos around the city (London). I'm thinking about starting drawing classes as well. I'm a teacher, so that keeps me very busy during the week, and I'm often quite tired at night during the week!
