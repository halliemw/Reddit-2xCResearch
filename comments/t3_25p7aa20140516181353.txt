I worked at planned parenthood and at a women's health clinic. Many of our patients couldn't afford to see any other doctors but we worked on a sliding scale and pro bono in extreme cases. So those resources are out there and I'm sorry but I would never trust any one in here with my health. 

It's like playing Russian roulette with you health. Sure a poster may have a question about an irregular period and users will calm her with anecdotes of their irregular periods. But she could potentially have something very serious going on that requires immediate medical attention. 

So my question is, how confident are you in your medical knowledge? Can you differentiate between a yeast infection and a serious medical problem? Can you identify peau d'orange and what it's a sign of? If not, then you definitely have no business giving out medical advice. Plain and simple.
