I think MeloJelo may be referring to a study that was publicized in various papers last year (?) that found that found that men who joke about rape are less likely to define some behaviors as rape or sexual assault (in essence, guys who joke about this are more likely to not see sexually aggressive behavior as wrong). I don't think I could find any articles about this off the top of my head, but they probably came up on TwoX at some point.
