Thank you so much. You're totally right. I usually appreciate her honesty, but this was just too much, especially considering that I was already so stressed out! 

Truthfully, I'm not a ruffles girl either - never thought I would EVER wear a dress with ruffles, but I felt that it worked with this particular style, so I went with it. Perhaps that's why I'm still feeling a little uncomfortable with it? Oh well!
