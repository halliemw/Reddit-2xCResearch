Really? Because I'm a woman and none of those things, are a major part of my life. 

I frankly don't care what you talk about but this subreddit is basically rape, vagina questions better left for a doctor instead of the goddamn Internet, what feminism means, period complaints, abortion, and and endless stream of relationship questions that should be in r/relationships.

It's the same 6 topics being shuffled and repeated constantly. Which I guess these are the only things being a woman is about since it's all everyone talks about in here.
