I'm into power-lifting. It's done wonders for my self esteem. Also whether you realize it or not, telling me "To be honest, it sounds as if you have no bones in your body whatsoever" is fucking mean, and I want to make you aware of that. 

Like I said in the post before, I'm great in social situations but I freeze and don't know what to do in unwanted "flirting" situations, simply because I have almost NEVER been flirted with in the past. Yeah, I have low self esteem, but i'm not completely void of it. I'm just seriously lacking in this area due to inexperience. The situation I described was further compounded by me being at work, so I was reaching out for advice from fellow women. 

Telling me "To be honest, it sounds as if you have no bones in your body whatsoever" and then asking me to get some self esteem is really counter intuitive. I LOVE that you mentioned taking martial arts. That is a fantastic idea. You have wisdom to offer this subreddit, so I feel like you should know, if you lead with a scathing insult, it's going to make it hard for people to take your good advice, and that's a shame, because it is good.
