I got one when I was 28, but I will say that it was not until about this year that it finally started feeling comfortable. (never had children, so I guess it took a few extra years for my hips to widen) Therefore, my recommendation is that if you are <30 and haven't had kids, to get the smaller size.

It does take some experimentation to figure out how to seal it, so it won't leak. I'd try the first time on the weekend when you aren't planning on going out, so you can reset it, if need be. Otherwise I also still use panty liners, just in case.

THAT SAID: they are awesome! I used to have to go to the bathroom every 3-4 hours on Day 1 of my cycle. Not anymore! I don't need to empty it until I get home from work. It's so totally liberating.
