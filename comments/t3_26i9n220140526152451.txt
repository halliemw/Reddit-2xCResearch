That's fair. But if that's the case, then you should know better than to say with certainty that it "is not abuse or neglect." It's an undoubtedly complicated situation, but I think that's it's prudent to err on the side of caution rather than dismiss the issue entirely. We're only hearing one side of the story, but what we're hearing displays extremely questionable behavior on the mother's part, and I don't think it's unreasonable to question the level of care that her child is receiving.
