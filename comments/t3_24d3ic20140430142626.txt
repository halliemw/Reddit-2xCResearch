Seeking genetic counciling sounds like a smart move. As for mammograms, maybe she should take the GP's concerns seriously too since there is a large and important literature that overtesting in general, and mammograms in particular, do more harm then good in low risk populations. That is why the screening recommendations have been changing. [This page](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/mammograms) from the NCI outlines some of these concerns. They mention specifically that the rate of false positives is higher for women with a family history. 24 is very young, even for those that have BRCA1 - the Stanford BRCA risk calculator doesn't even have a category that young http://brcatool.stanford.edu/brca.html

[This wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_paradox) explains the statistical phenomenon at work when screening tests are used on a population with a low incidence of occurence for a disease.
