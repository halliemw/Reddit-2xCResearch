This sounds like when I got a UTI that the doctor wouldn't treat because there weren't enough bacteria in my pee sample. It progressed to the late stages of a bladder infection, and started heading for my kidneys. I had the most awful pain in my back. Tell me, if you lightly punch your kidneys (your lower back) does it hurt a lot? That's one of the signs.

Either way, please go to a doctor right away.
