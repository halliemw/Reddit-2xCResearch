Actually you bring up a very good point. I actually shouldn't have used the word "victim" at all because from recent dialogues about sexual assault and rape, it seems that the generally preferred and politically correct term  is actually "survivor." I think the reason for this is exactly what you said about not letting the experience define you. However, I feel as if it can be difficult to strike a balance between not letting the experience define you and also, learning to not blame the survivor/victim of the experience. I don't want to seem as if I am wallowing in self-pity but I also want to be able to process this correctly.

If I'm being honest, he had truly convinced me that I was a bad girlfriend. He used to tell me that I was a really rude, inconsiderate person all the time and I had never really seen how unhealthy the way he treated me was until this recent experience starting with the nightmare. I have a lot of problems with blaming myself for guys sexually harassing me because I may sometimes dance/dress/act sexy but I need to learn to stop doing that.

To answer your last question, I hadn't really thought about which is worse but I feel as if I may have been thinking less about the gropings just because that wasn't the part in my dream, I guess. I think in the moment, the gropings felt more violating, though.
