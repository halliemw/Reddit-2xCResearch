I never had very heavy periods to begin with. But I found when I started taking the pill it greatly reduced how heavy my period was. On the pill I never got cramps and I had basically NO acne what so ever. I stopped taking the pill a couple years ago because I get migraines (so doctors won't prescribe it because of increasing the risk of stroke). My periods have definitely become much more heavy since stopping (it took my body a few months to adjust after stopping the pill). 

I only one had an issue with the pill I was initially put on - within the first 3-4 months I had a really bad break through bleeding that last about 4 hours (went through super tampons like crazy). The first 3-4 months my boobs swelled up, but that's about it. But I do know lots of my friends have had issues and had to switch brands until finding one that had the right levels of each hormone for them.

Edit: remembered a break through bleeding.
