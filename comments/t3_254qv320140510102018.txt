> I think all that actually tells us is that our news organizations are shitty, because no one heard about it. It's not that we all knew and no one batted an eye.

Thats not actually true.  But sure the difference is no one read the news and decided it was a big enough deal to put on tv.

etc.  I mean it goes on.  You can find it in a google search.  I think it was covered by every major news organization.

> If you want a story on dead people and people who have been shot, you have plenty of them in your own country I'm sure, and many of them are also white so it's that much more shocking for all the bigots out there.

Well white is half of the equation to make shocking news, but its not the whole equation.  [this is referred to as the missing white woman syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_white_woman_syndrome)  its a verifiable phenomenon.  Theres no such thing as the missing boy syndrome or the boy burnt alive syndrome or anything like that.

> So what kind of lives do you think those girls will have in a country that is still heavily religious? How many people do you think will be willing to marry the ex-sex slaves, especially when the region is still very much steeped in a fairly extreme version of a religion that places a lot of value on women's virginity and that provides women with few opportunities to support themselves financially? How well do you think they'll cope with everything that has been done to them? What good is it to be alive when you're likely to be shunned for the rest of your life because of things that were done to you, especially when I can guarantee you that there are people there, just like there's a fringe element anywhere, who will believe that these girls caused their own abductions and slavery by wanting an education?

Im sure its a terrible life, but seriously.. they are still ALIVE, they were not BURNED to death.  Thats the most painful way to die.  Like the girls, the boys just wanted an education.  This isnt a women's rights issue.  Its bullshit to just sweep the charred remains of boys under the rug so that we can grandstand and make it into a women's issue.  This is a HUMAN RIGHTS issue.

> I also don't think that hashtag is bigoted, because in this situation, we're talking about men selling girls.

The perpetrators in this case are black muslims so with that in mind.  Would you be in favor of a more inclusive hashtag?  

such as ##realblackmendontburnboysaliveandsellgirlstoslavery ?

or ##realmuslimsdontcommitterroristactsagainstschoolchildren ?

or still ##realwomendontignoreboysbeingburnedalive ?

Its bigoted.  This is exactly what bigotry looks like.
