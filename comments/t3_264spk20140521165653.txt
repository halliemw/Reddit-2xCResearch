On the other hand, therapy usually only works if you're willing to accept it. I was stubborn and angry when my mom took me to therapy and refused to believe it would do anything, so since I thought it was a waste of time, it was. BUT, it's significantly better than some people I know who were raised being told that therapy is weak, bad, or only for "crazy people."
