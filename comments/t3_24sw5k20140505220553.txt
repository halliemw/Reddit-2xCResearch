I too had a relationship that ended after about 7 years. It is a long time. The experience is a significant part of what makes me the way I am today (better, I like to think). You, him and your relationship must have had a lot of good in them to have lasted so long but everything and everyone has their faults. You have learned, and you will continue to learn from it, as you think about what happened in the years to come.

Was your judgement off? Or did he change? People do change, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. At best, you know what people do and say, not what they think and feel, no matter how close you are to them. To an extent, your love is of a fantasy, built around your experience of the other person but also reflecting your understanding, expectations and desires.

When you began to love him, you didn't know he was capable of this. Once established, love doesn't give up easily. Maybe you should have realized it a bit sooner. You say you had suspicions. But relationships require trust, risk and a positive, constructive approach to problems. You did well to give him the benefit of the doubt while there was doubt. Don't be too hard on yourself for not seeing it sooner.

Remember how this relationship enriched your life and move on to find other relationships and experiences.
