Girl, I am in the exact same position as you right now. Abusive ex, sweet and serious long-term current partner, sex should be amazing with the dude but it's not.

Honestly, though, the thing that's helped with my partner has been a lot of talking. We eventually--after four years--derived a solution that works FOR US. He hates it if I'm not "all there" when we have sex, so after a lot of discussion he decided (because I'm still happy to have chore sex with him) that he'd be most comfortable if I was the only person to instigate sexual actions and if I stopped the second I started to feel like it was a chore. For example, if I feel the urge to perform oral sex on him, I do so, up to the point where I can tell I'm going to freak out (and it really is a wall, isn't it? Kind of like a roaring blankness for me), at which point I quit and, uh, give him a little privacy. It's been painfully slow so far, but I'm much more comfortable being emotionally intimate with him while I'm being physically intimate now.

Edit: PM me if you need someone who's been there to listen.
