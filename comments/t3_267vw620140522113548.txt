Hi there sorry to hear you're having a bad experience with the implant :( I tried out the implant last year because I wanted an alternative to the pill after stupidly forgetting to take it with me on holiday once. I think I had a similar experience to you because my libido went through the roof and I had constant break through bleeding for nearly 6 months! After those horrible first 6 months my libido did return to normal and the bleeding settled down to being regular again. So hopefully if you stick with it things will settle down for you soon :)
