a lot of people struggle to understand this.  let me try to explain.

the comments are mean.  the decision to make them is sexist.

everything you say is a product of a choice you make.  consciously or subconsciously, you evaluate the value and repercussions of voicing a thought and decide whether or not to utter it.

in this case, these guys decided that they valued lionization and backslapping by their male peers over not insulting their female friend.  i think that is a sexist choice, enabled by sexist social structures.  i don't care enough about my "social value" among other men to insult women i know behind their back.  these other guys did.
