My economics teacher says that "unequal pay based on gender is a myth". He says that with the same *experience and education*, pay-grades are the same, regardless of gender.

Was Mrs. Abramson really discriminated against? Was education and experience a factor in the Times' decision on the salaries of Bill Keller and Jill Abramson? I saw this story and decided to investigate myself.

**Education:** 

Bill Keller: graduated from Pomono College in 1970. No special graduate degree or anything, just your typical 4 year college. 

Jill Abramson: Received a BA in History and Literature from Harvard University/ Radcliffe College in 1976. Same thing here, no special graduate degrees or masters programs, just a four-year undergraduate degree.

Education Edge: We'll give the slight edge to Abramson, because Harvard.

**Experience:** 

Bill Keller started working after graduation at the *Oregonian* in 1970 and worked as a reporter until 1979. I'm unsure what he did from 1979-1984, but it is probable that he worked as a reporter at another paper, because in 1984, he became a reporter at the *Times*. He had a long career at the *Times*, becoming bureau chief in '88, and executive editor in 2003 until 2011 (with Abramson filling this position in 2011).

Jill Abramson worked at her university paper, and also at the *Times* while in college from '73-'76. This was probably on a part-time, internship basis, but I'll still include it in her 'experience'. Afterwards, she spend a decade as a senior staff reporter for *The American Lawyer*. From 1988-1997, she was a senior reporter for *The Wall Street Journal*. She joined the *Times* in 1997, becoming the Washington Bureau chief in 2000, and finally replaced Bill Keller as executive editor in 2011.

**Recap:**

**Education Recap:** *Equal* (slight edge to Jill Abramson because she went to Harvard)

**Experience Recap:** 

Years experience in career-field: Bill Keller: 41 years ('70-'11) ; Jill Abramson: 40 years ('73-'13). ***Slight edge***, Bill Keller by a few years. Even including Jill's 3 year, part time, college internship at the Times, Bill still has the slight edge.

Years experience at the New York Times: Bill Keller: 27 years ('84-'11). Jill Abramson: 19 years. ('73-76 & '97-'13). ***8 year edge goes to Bill Keller, even including Jill's college experience with the Times.***

Years experience in *NYT* executive editor position: Bill Keller: 8 years (2003-2011); Jill Abramson: <2 years (June 2011 to May 2013). ***Profound edge to Mr. Keller.***

My findings show that their backgrounds were *not* the same, and that the *Times* had every right to have paid Mr. Keller a higher wage than Mrs. Abramson, based on his longer experience in journalism, at the Times, and in his former position. If Mrs. Abramson wanted to legitimize her "unequal pay" argument, (if this is indeed what she did), she would need more years experience, or something to make her stand out, like say, the Pulitzer Prize that Bill Keller won in 1988. I guess my economics teacher was right. Unequal pay based on gender is a myth.
