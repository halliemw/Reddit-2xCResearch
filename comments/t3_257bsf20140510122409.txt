Well done to you for being a good friend, for buying planb, and for highlighting the horrific culture of ownership of women.  It's a pity your friend could not overcome her own shame, but it just shows you what horrible stigma is attached to being responsible! 

I agree with your description of the whacked logic...it makes no sense! 

Keep it up, you guys give me hope for the next generation x
