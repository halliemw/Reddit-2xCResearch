I'll have a streak of fairly regular periods*, then suddenly I'll go months without any sign of blood until the night of the b horror movie special effects. My god. It's almost like Goku saving up for a spirit bomb.

*fairly regular meaning only like 1-2 week variation in start times, but sometimes I'll have two in like a two week time.
