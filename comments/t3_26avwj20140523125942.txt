Is it possible for you to call his office today? Is your doctor a GP or and GYN? The biggest risk for your boyfriend is passing the high risk strain to another person, it won't affect you since you already have it.

Statistically, this will go away on its own with no problems except extra doctors visits. You do need to take steps to get it checked out just in case, though.

I really think the cervical pain is something different, however.
