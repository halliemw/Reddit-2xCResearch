\#NotAllMen is a shaming tactic directed at any men that want to talk about male issues.

> Quit being rapey

I'd have to start, first.

> and then it means not you

I never said it was about me.  It's about *men*.

Let's imagine I said that women inhabit a "culture of bitchiness."  Then, when you complain I could say: "I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about the bitchy women."

It's not about me, it's the portrayal of men in general, and the associating men as a group with a mentally ill spree shooter.
