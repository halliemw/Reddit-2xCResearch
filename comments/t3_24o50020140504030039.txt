I have one of those in my group. His most recent offense was posting a crude sexual comment on a photo of me I uploaded to Facebook. It was a comment referring to certain sex acts that he asked if I did with my boyfriend (of almost a decade! - this other guy should know better). I deleted it before anyone (especially my boyfriend) saw it, but holy hell, FILTER yourself sometimes. 

Essentially, I leave him on that fringe. He's invited to events, though he doesn't really show up too often. I agree with the idea to ask him to explain why his comments are funny, because that puts *him* on the spot unexpectedly. Some learn to empathize in that moment.
