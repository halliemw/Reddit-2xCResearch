> In a world that focuses on what we're wearing instead of what we've achieved? That's definitely not equal. 

I know this is a problem I have and I don't know how to fix it, so I'm asking here (female btw). Whenever a woman appears on camera, I can't stop focusing on her appearance and attractiveness, make up, or the appropriateness of her clothes. It's almost automatic, even when I try to focus on what she's saying I can't pay as much attention as when a guy is saying the same thing.  It's worse if she's explaining something complex, like science or politics. WTF should I do? I don't want to contribute to this problem, I don't say anything out loud, I even criticise people who mention her appearance but I still do it in my head.
