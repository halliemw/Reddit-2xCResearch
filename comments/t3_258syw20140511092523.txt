Actually, you're right, I apologize for not reading past the words "legal definition". 

There's still a problem here though. 

Your big claim is that these guys admitted to it "JUST AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE THE WORD 'RAPE'" implying that they 
#1. Don't think what they did could be considered rape.  


#2. Possibly committed the rape because they didn't think it was actually rape in their minds. 

#3. Don't think what they did was wrong. 

And you also strongly imply that this is a strictly male issue.

This study doesn't support those implications as far as I can see.
