Don't apologize! I figured you tried to email/text but sometimes the simple things are overlooked. I'm glad all the photos were erased from FB. It does seem as though the damage has been done and you're not getting the phone back. I hope the police will cooperate but I also understand that if they tried to find every stolen phone, that's all they'd be doing. I live in a city and one time my coworkers phone got stolen. He was the asst. manager at the drug store we worked at. He kept calling and finally they answered. They set up a meet in a public place downtown. The thief said she'd be wearing jeans and a red tee shirt or something along those lines. He said he'd be in a blue jacket and khaki pants. Well he got near the spot, called her, said he had the money for the exchange, found the woman matching her description talking on the phone and actually stole the phone out of her hand because he wasn't wearing what he said. So while this method isn't safe, I'm just saying thiefs aren't the smartest people. Check Craigslist and eBay often. Keep calling the number. Even if it dies, they may have shut it off. Hopefully they'll turn it back on. And if your face wasn't in the photos then hopefully you could be spared when it comes to FB? Especially if your husband was hacked.
