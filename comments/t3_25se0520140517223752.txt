Bariatric Surgery is the catch-all term weight loss surgeries. :)

Gastric Bypass refers to RNY surgery:  http://www.wlscenter.com/ResearchArticles/RNY_article.htm

Duodenal Switch is similar, but different in some very important ways:  http://www.dsfacts.com/duodenal-switch-procedure.html#.U3gqp_ldVvk

Comparison of the two:  http://www.dsfacts.com/Comparison-of-DS-and-RNY.html#.U3gqwvldVvk

The RNY is less expensive and less complicated.  The DS is superior long-term.  It's really important to find a qualified, vetted surgeon in either case!  PM me if you'd like to know more. :)

P.S., the LapBand isn't that great.
