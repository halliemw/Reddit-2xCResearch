Yes, I know that medically, it isn't a big deal. But oh, the stigma. It's especially frustrating for me because I don't know with certainty whether or not I have it. It's also making me co-dependent on my boyfriend. I feel dependent upon him emotionally now. He's completely fine with it either way, but I'm not. I feel like he's the only one who will accept me, and it's a terrible way to think and feel.
