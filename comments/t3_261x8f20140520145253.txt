Brave post, shafonfa. :P

Some of these make some really good points. While I dislike the "non-violent" phrase as word choice, I agree about the sentiments behind #1-3 + #7. I think most other pro-choice women would also agree that we absolutely need affordable pre-natal and peri-natal care for women, and particularly both medical and psychological care. If you've got the choice between inexpensive abortion and expensive no-support pregnancy / adoption, it barely even registers as a choice. 

I personally would take issue with #5, because pregnancy care centers  don't necessarily seem to provide many of the other services that PP provides, including pro-life friendly options like birth control, STD testing and gyno exams. I'm not familiar with the strict definition of pregnancy care centers, so please let me know if I've got a misconception.

I also find #6 to be distasteful in the same way that the "real women" phrase leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

#4 also seems to contradict many of the posts I've seen. Some women never think again about their abortion, other women do find the memory quite painful. Others fall somewhere in between.
