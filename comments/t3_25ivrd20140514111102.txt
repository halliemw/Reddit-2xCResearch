This is exactly like my ex. When I broke up with him, I tried to stay in touch but he would just whine on the phone to me constantly about how I broke his heart and was the best thing ever. What am I supposed to do with that? I'm your ex! Sorry I crushed your heart. I had to cut him off and when I did he ended up calling my best friend and talking to her about it. She was fine with it at first because he was so sad and I just felt so bad for him but the calls were constant and he always said the same things and finally she had to cut him off too. It was a nightmare and still is.
