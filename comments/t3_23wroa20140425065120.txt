I feel like a logical follow up to this would be: "I support equal treatment of people, this includes equal treatment regardless of race. Does this make me (insert race other than your own here)?"; or "I support equal treatment of people, this includes equal treatment regardless of gender. Does this make me (insert opposite gender here)." or whatever else you can come up with.

It's so strange the way people's brains work.

On the other side of things, I'm also straight and massive supporter of LGBTQ rights. I have been accused twice in the last few years of having a problem with lesbians (one accuser was a coworker and the other a stranger) and my response both times was to burst out into laughter.
