Are minipills generally kinda unreliable, side-effect-wise? I tried it a few years back, and it gave me the opposite problem: no period. Which seemed cool at first. I didn't have a period for like... 5 months. 

After 3 months, I asked my Kaiser GP if this was normal, and she was like, "Meh... it happens." 

Around the five month line, my breasts started feeling tender and achey, but still no period. I took pregnancy tests, which came back negative. I contacted my OBGYN, and she flipped and said that my body must not be handling the pill well, and that my breast tissue is basically storing the progestin.

So... back to the regular pill I went, and back I stayed.
