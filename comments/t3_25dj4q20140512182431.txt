I once was put in the same situation.  I am one of a few straight males in a largely gay circle of friends.  At a party one friend-of-a-friend I had never met before followed me around trying to convince me to kiss him/go home with him.  Wouldn't take no for an answer.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so I took my leave of the party by bidding my friends goodnight to get away from this guy.  All of my friends apologized when they found out and never invited said guy to another event.  Gay culture isn't really a thing like your friends seem to believe.  Decent people are good to be around.  Creepy, untrustworthy people are not.  Once you find out which is which, stick to your guns.  At least you got your boyfriend to come around.
