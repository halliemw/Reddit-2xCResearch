You're right. Not the best title. I kind of realized it after the fact. 

I did feel very frustrated when I initially began writing it, which explains why it is what it is, kind of just a spur-of-the-moment release of emotions. However I couldn't really think of another way to put it, considering it was mostly just a rant about my frustration with not being able to win with men, or achieve the desired outcome with them without either looking like an ungrateful bitch or a tease. It's just a very complicated internal struggle.

I was just kind of hoping that people read the content of my post instead of the title to make their judgement.
