I just want to piggyback/compliment this.

OP, you are probably going to receive many PMs for choosing an abortion. They may try to dissuade you for "moral reasons". Often people who are anti-abortion/anti-choice enough to PM you will be completely uneducated about abortion, pregnancy, and the rights you will or will not have during pregnancy and while you are a mother. The things they will tell you sound almost believable, but know that they are lies and myths. I would encourage you to talk to an abortionist about what abortion really entails, especially if you are past the cut-off for the abortion pill (**this is not the same as Plan B or emergency contraception**). If I remember correctly from the previous post about seeking an abortion, there is a subreddit called r/prochoice. You may find the support and resources you need there.

I hope that you get all the care and support you need for this. Don't be afraid to seek counseling after the abortion, should you choose to do it. You don't have to do this alone, and worst case scenario, there are many of us here who would love to be a source of comfort for you.
