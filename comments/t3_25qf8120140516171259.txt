I'm truly sorry you went through all of that, and I agree that the college was wrong to laugh you off. While I haven't been assaulted while I slept, I was harassed and verbally and psychologically abused by my college suitemates. Again, like you, administration laughed me off, told me I needed to "talk to them and make up." Like that was going to stop them.

Thank you for sharing your story, hold your head high against the hate. Know that you are so much better than the hateful people that put you down. Surround yourself with friends you can confide in, if possible, even if they are online friends. My online friends got me through my situation.  

It's going to get better. Promise.
