Look at it this way, you've reached a point where you can still fix this before it became a massive (sorry for the pun) health problem. And that's something to be admired! Some people literally go through their whole lives without changing a thing.

Definitely agree with everyone who says to start small. Reducing portions or cutting out snacks is an easy first step. This should see a couple pounds drop without any exercise if you have been used to a diet of large portions. And once the first pounds go, trust me, you will feel so motivated to kick it up a notch that you could even incorporate exercise and physical activity into your routine to see even more come off. 

Totally relate to your family of big eaters. Seriously, just stand your ground. It's hard and your family and friends will be hurt by it and maybe even bully you but just remember why you are saying no. Focus on that and explain it to them if they won't let it go.
