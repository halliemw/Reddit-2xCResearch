I can't believe no one has mentioned tea tree oil yet! That stuff is my saviour when it comes to bv and yeast infections. I dab a little bit all over my vulva and some inside my vagina and then I'll sleep without undies. Works like a charm. 
I'm also a fan of yogurt (just be sure it's completely plain and has nothing added in like sugar) and garlic.
