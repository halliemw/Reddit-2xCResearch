I'm saying we actually don't know what causes the disparities, and we need to look into it more, but I think that it's entirely possible that the differential amounts of attention that preschool and elementary school teachers give boys and girls, not to mention the differential ways we socialize boys and girls from birth, does cause girls to "try harder", or at least to be more approval-seeking as a measure of their personal worth.
