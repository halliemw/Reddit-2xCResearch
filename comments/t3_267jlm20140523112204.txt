I'm sorry you had to deal with that. That sounds just like my brother : (  He's off truck driving somewhere currently, won't get help. He's not talking to me or my parents and they're worried sick. I wish people like this could just understand that no, they're not normal and that they need some kind of help. Jesus hasn't fixed you yet on your own. (not that he thinks there's anything wrong with him, it's everyone else of course) Ugh. So sad. So hard to deal with when it's your family member. At least for me I'm almost lucky in a way it's my brother and not a parent/child.
