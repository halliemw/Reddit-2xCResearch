Well, when we broke up, he wanted to make sure I wasn't holding him back. He still wanted to explore, and I heartbroken but figured alright these things happen. A month and a half later after we both tried things out on our own, I still loved him, he came begging to get back together with me, and we've been even more in love ever since. It really opened up our eyes that we weren't holding each other back, and our future was something to really look forward to. I hope it works out with you! Just remember, if it's meant to be it'll be :)
