Don't pull out!  If you are taking the pill properly, and profess such good habits on taking it regularly, and for the length that you have been on the pill, there's no need to pull out (you're a great girl friend).  Had a girl friend for 5 years who took the pill regularly, and we each made sure to hammer it home every time.
