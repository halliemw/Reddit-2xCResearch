Funny you mention Korats. He looks enough like one that we thought he might be as a kitten, but his adult fur grew in double-layered.  He meets all the other breed descriptors (including the ringed eyes changing colour, ringed tail and light stripes as a kitten, tipped fur, temperament, number of toes, etc), but that is a big one.

I guess it's possible (but pretty unlikely) that he is half-Korat.  This little guy was found in an abandoned warehouse with 30 other kittens (feral cat colony den).  Korats are rare enough, and expensive enough, that they're unlikely to be wandering around and interacting with feral cats.  Far more likely he's just a regular ole domestic short hair that happens to have some Korat characteristics.
