Just one minor point that stood out to me: 

> We've been having rough talks lately and it came to a head last night when something in him finally clicked and he got the notion that our relationship is a trial, and Satan knows him so well and has tempted him with me and my dis-belief (he loves me so incredibly much that he considered for a teeny tiny second, abandoning his faith/turning his back on God), and all the sudden it is so very clear to him that he cannot marry and have a life with me if I do not believe. 

I know you said that this only a small piece of the puzzle, but considering that you're completely supportive of his belief (even if you don't share it - and you definitely should not even think about faking it!) and he still thinks you might be a "satanic temptation"... can you imagine what might happen if your relationship reaches a point where you're a little less supportive (or even opposed to some part of his faith)? I feel this could get really ugly really quick. And from what you described, if that situation ever came about, it sounds like he is definitely more invested in his faith than in you. **If he ever has to choose, he won't choose you.** That seems like an unhealthy basis for a serious relationship, to say the least.

That sucks and it's not a nice thing to think about, but... maybe it's better to realize this now before a marriage or kids make things much more complicated.

> Should I try to become a believer by surrounding myself with it, and just see what happens?

No.
