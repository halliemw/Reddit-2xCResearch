My down votes came after a while - after the points were visible.  I'm trying to just lurk and get in there and upvote people whose views are unusual, because I think it's needed here.  But it's difficult to refrain from posting, as I do have points of view.  

(I just got down voted on another thread, apparently for suggesting anti-depressants to someone who is suicidal and for whom talk therapy isn't working).  Right now, I'm the only one who can see that down vote - but in half an hour, I'm sure I'll get more.  

Baby-Beluga's post (a few more posts down) is excellent (although on many threads, saying that you're a professional in something can put you on perilous ground - or at least, that's what I've observed).  She's making a fairly subtle point, but it applies to many threads here.  (Upvote her!)  I'd comment on her post, but I have to wait ten minutes and it's late.  

(Sorry for assuming she's a she, but given the thread, I think she probably is - I'm just picking a pronoun, folks, that's all).
