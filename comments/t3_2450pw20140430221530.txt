I gave him my number after one conversation online and we texted constantly for a week. We also snapchatted a bit and it made it seem like I was talking to an actual person. If they don't want to meet in a public place RUN AWAY and never talk to them again. Originally my boyfriend wanted me to walk across campus to his room the first time we met, but I expressed concern about walking home late at night and he was super nice about it, he ended up coming to my room at a time when friends were in the connecting room...they came in to say hi (and to make their presence known). Physical chemistry may surprise you...we knew we liked eachother but I couldn't help but kiss him before he left that night. Best first kiss ever.
