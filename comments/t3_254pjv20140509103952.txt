Funny I was just thinking about this. I think my moms great, she and I fought a good bit when I was a teenager but since I went to boarding school at age 16 and as I've gained more and more independence (now 23) I think the relationship has gotten better and we connect more now because we're not around each other enough to fight really. 

So I have a medical procedure coming up, and my moms coming to take care of me and drive me there and such. And I'm really wondering how it'll go. My mom is a coddling type, and tends a bit towards hypochondria. She was always super responsive to my every symptom and quick to suggest calling the doctor. But with this, I really want to push myself to get back on my feet. I don't even go under general anesthesia. But I'm wondering if by being with my mom I'll be pulled into over analyzing every little symptom and slowing my recovery.
