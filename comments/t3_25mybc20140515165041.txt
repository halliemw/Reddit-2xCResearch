When I was a teenager, my periods were completely unreliable. I would go months without having one, and when I would get it, I'd get the most awful cramps that would leave me stuck in bed, crying from pain (and I have a high pain tolerance). The pain would only go away after I threw up a few times, but I'd still have cramps after that. 

Long story short, bc pills have seriously helped me so much. I know *exactly* when my period is gonna start, and I still get cramps, but nothing close to what I experienced before.

Yes, you have to remember to take it everyday, but it's not that big of a deal. Just set an alarm on your phone. There are other options out there, but I highly doubt your gyno will give you an iud just because of your age. You might have to experiment a bit and find the method that works for you, but it'll be worth it :)
