I've been told to smile once and it caught me off guard, but even crazier was when I had the *opposite* happen. I was walking home after work and passed by a cafe with outdoor seating. An older man was sitting by himself, looks over at me, and yells "FUCK YOU!" For some reason my automatic reaction was to yell, "Have a great day!"
