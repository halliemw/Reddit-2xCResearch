Explain to him it bothers you & why, but don't do it just after he's used the word, it'll likely make him defensive, and lead to an argument.

Then ask him to stop, it's fair to expect him to cut this from every day usage, but he'll likely always slip up from time to time. Please be understanding of this, it's a word that been in his regular vocabulary for a long time and he'll likely slip up occasionally forever.
