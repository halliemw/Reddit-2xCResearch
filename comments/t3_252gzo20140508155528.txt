It's so weird that several of these restaurants think that being female friendly means that women want to see sexy girls in skimpy clothing. Isn't that exactly what places like Hooters or the Tilted Kilt do to be more attractive to male customers? It seems to me that if anything that would alienate women from going somewhere.
