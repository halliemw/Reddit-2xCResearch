First off, I want to tell you that it is absolutely okay to feel sad about this. Some women can go through this and not regret it but you absolutely do not have to be 100% okay with this. Whether it's hormones or something deeper, you're allowed to feel that way

Secondly, you should talk to your boyfriend about how you feel. Hiding it isn't going to make anything any better. If you can mourn this baby together things might be better. He needs to support you through this. I would also suggest maybe lighting one of those paper lanterns and letting it fly away to signify letting go of the baby.

I really hope you can get through this. You can also try counselling just for someone to talk to.
