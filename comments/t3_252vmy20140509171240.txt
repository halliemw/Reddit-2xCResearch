Deep down this is exactly what I am hoping for, that we would find each other again at some point down the road. And from the beginning, I have been completely open and excited to move wherever he was once I was done with my PhD. But I am trying so hard not to put too much hope into that, because it would be years away and who knows what happens in that much time? Who knows if he'd still be single (or if I would). But I guess that's where it ultimately is out of our hands. If it's meant to be...it will be.
