Hi! Hope these kind of posts are welcome, because I need a bit of advice! 

Unnecessary backstory because I need to vent a bit (skip past this paragraph for actual question): 

Summer is coming quickly and soon it's gonna be too hot to wear jeans. Here's the thing: I'm 16, and I've never shaved. There's a couple reasons for that. Firstly, I'm a bit of a late bloomer and my body hair really isn't that thick. This ties into the bigger reason, which is that my mom doesn't support me shaving. She's awfully traditional and European, she never wears makeup, she's never had her nails done, and she certainly doesn't want her baby daughter to start shaving! It took until last summer for me to convince her to at least buy me some waxing strips or something. She's fine with waxing, but I'm kinda tired of it and just want to shave like everybody else. That's why I'm turning to you gals for some motherly advice! 

I've bought myself a Venus Embrace razor and it came with one cartridge. It wasn't the cheapest thing, but I wanted to get myself something that I hope is high quality. Now what I have no clue about is how many times can I use the cartridge? Is it usable only once? From what I gather, you can reuse it a few times, but I'm worried about overusing it. 

In addition, my friends have talked about how washing your legs with conditioner before shaving does wonders. How exactly does that work? Do I wash my legs, then dry them off, then just shave? Or do I shave my legs with the conditioner still on? And do I put moisturiser on afterwards?

Sorry for the silly post, but I had no idea where else to go. :)
