Hi!  I'm 30f, and was finally diagnosed with endometriosis (operative lapropscopy) two years ago after hellish periods ever since I was 12.  The surgeon removed all the endo that was visible, however it had very little effect on the pain I experience every month.  

I'm booked to see the surgeon again in a month, and I'm sure he's going to try and push me down the Mirena IUD path.  I'm really, really hesitant about any hormonal treatments, as I've had terrible times on OCP (various types), and straight progesterone pills every time I've tried.

I'd love to hear about any non-hormonal endometriosis treatment that has worked for people!
