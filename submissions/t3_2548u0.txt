MOST of the time I don't mind catcalling. Sometimes I find it fun, sometimes I find it irritating and obnoxious. I always feel able to respond to it with either a smile or a curse. I find it a whole lot less troubling than the abuse I receive as a cyclist. 

Anyway, I read this [article](http://www.vice.com/read/i-love-wolf-whistles-and-catcalls-am-i-a-bad-feminist) about another feminist who actually likes catcalling, but I still feel like a bad feminist for not hating it.

 How do you feel about catcalling?
