I feel attractive with a bra on, when it comes off I look awful and it's hard to enjoy sex. Sadly I have very saggy tits and I can't afford surgery until I'm in my thirties at least. 

Is there a way to forget about what I look like without a bra on so that I can feel attractive without a bra on? 

None of my partners have ever liked my boobs either, although I hated them before I let other people see them.

And please don't post the normal breasts gallery, I know they're 'normal', I just have a problem with how ugly and unsexy they are.
