Please read our sidebar! We can only be as good of a community as our community is vigilant about respect, rules, and reporting. Please, *please report posts and comments violating the sidebar guidelines*. The mods do an excellent job of getting eyeballs on what is reported.

Please be *welcoming*. No, we aren't a teeny tiny treehouse anymore, but it can be a great thing to have a forum dedicated to women's voices and discussion of the female experience. 

Please don't feed trolls! Remember what kind of state someone has to be in just to get their gaggles up over internet trolling. Don't engage! Simply **report**, and move on. The 2X mod squad is ON IT. Because they are the best, and want this to continue to be a place where girls and women can feel solidarity and community. 

Thanks for being there, 2X!
