I know there are probably quite a few people here that may be 'anti-porn' anything, but I think Kelly's message is empowering to women, it gives insight to the behind the scenes of a porn mag, and basically shows what a headstrong and beautiful woman (of any size) can do when she decides she wants to do it. 

The interview is honest, real, insightful, and funny. If you want to, you can read the interview [here](http://www.nerve.com/features/talking-with-kelly-shibari-the-first-plus-size-woman-ever-on-the-cover-of-penthouse-forum).
