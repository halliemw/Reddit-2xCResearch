The past last year I was struggling with yeast infection all the time and it never went away. Now it's better but I still get infections all the time. Now I have athlete's foot and the same thing on my hands and I can't go anywhere to get help. I'm probably infecting everything I touch and I'm having frequently panic attacks.

The healthcare system is shit here and they don't help me and I don't have money for medication or private care. Nothing works, nothing helps, nothing eases anything up. Addition to that I have depression and an ED and I'm considering to just stopping everything, because I can't take life anymore in such a deficit body. 

This is not a plea for help, I just needed to tell somewhere because it's such an embarrassing issue that can never be spoken of. Too bad this place isn't safe anymore either and I'll probably be bombarded with insults and hatemonger.
