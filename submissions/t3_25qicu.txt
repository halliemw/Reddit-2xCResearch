Hello Women of Reddit! (And the men and trolls listening too.) I wanted to ask what your thoughts are on the men who come here due to hearing about the influx of trolls once this became a default. Do you dislike them for trying to help out? Angry at them for being here? I want to start a serious discussion, that includes the women AND men. Let's talk about this calmly and rationally! Do you want the men who came here to fight the trolls or support the women to stay or leave? I've gotten a few pieces of advice i like, such as not apologizing for the jerk-ish men, not calling yourself a nice guy, etc. Any advice for the men who risked the wrath to come here and see what was up? 
Edit: After so many negative comments, after a simple request for a discussion, i'm out of this sub. Too many trigger happy people shooting anything that moves. Good luck 2x. I hope it all works out for you. I'm deleting pretty much every post from here, but I'm leaving this one in the hopes somebody learns a lesson from it. I know I did.
