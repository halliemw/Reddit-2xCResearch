We've all been there, you are on your period and have to change your feminine product at another person's house. Its kind of mortifying to think they'll see it when they take their trash out, so I have a somewhat more secure way of hiding it in the trash. This isn't fool proof because you need there to be one of those empty cardboard toilet rolls already in the trash. If there is one though, roll your tampon or pad or what have you in a little toilet paper and  stuff that thing in the middle of the empty roll, then put a little more toilet paper on either side of it to act as stoppers. They'll never know.
