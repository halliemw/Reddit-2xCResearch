Throw away because I'm sure he's on reddit, we're both nerds and I don't want him to really come across this.

So I'm not *quite* seeing this guy, but it seems to be heading in that direction. We had sex for the first time last night and he's definitely smaller than most guys I've been with. I enjoyed the sex as much as I could mainly because I like him and it was an enjoyable evening, but it was definitely missing some sparks.

Now, I'm chalking part of this up to me having "whisky clit" (is that a thing?) since I drank a bit and was sobering up in the process which tends to kill my libido. But there's also the part I can't really do anything about.

I can read articles and stuff all I want, but I was looking for advice from people who've been in this situation and how they made it work.
