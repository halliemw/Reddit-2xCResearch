I have messed up big time. 

I wanted to get rid of the pink that was in my hair. It was faded and I though it was faded enough. So I dyed it blonde thinking that it would completely lift and I was totally wrong. my roots are a really nasty blonde/yellow. The rest is bright red/pink.

So far I am on my second round of head and shoulders. But is there anyway to resolve this?

Edit
Ok after the second round the bright red is now a pink.

The dye was garnier nutriese camomile 100

My hair was not pre-bleached before hand and it is usually dirty blonde. I don't mind going a darker color. I only have till monday morning to sort this out before work haha.
