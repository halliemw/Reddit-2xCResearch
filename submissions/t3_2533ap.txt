I told my colleagues that I'm having my bum-length hair all cut off so I can donate it to Little Princess Trust so they can turn it into wigs for sick children and one of my colleagues (same age as me) just said 'I don't like girls with short hair'.

My immediate reply was 'I have a boyfriend already who loves me for who I am and not what I look like. But thanks for the offer.'

I just thought after, while this lad is otherwise lovely and sweet and funny etc, who says that? In one sentence he reduced my charitable action into a personal preference.... Just... What?

P.S Wasn't allowed to put the charity donation link to my event. :( boo.  But also kudos to very active and vigilant mods!

Edit: went to bed and woah! Over 200 comments! Thanks for all the support and well wishes. To those who think I was fishing for compliments, on reading it back I can see why you would think that but the reason I was raising it in work was that I didn't know if we had a rule about staff's hair (I know we have to have it up) and it was while asking this that my colleague replied in this way.

On another note, if anyone would like to donate still, my link is still up on a post in /r/charity, just go through my username to find my post in /r/charity. Even if you think I'm a knobend, the cause is a worthy cause and even if you donate pennies (or cents) then it's still very much appreciated. Thanks lovely people!
