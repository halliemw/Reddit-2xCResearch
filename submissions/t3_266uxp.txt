Friday of last week I proposed to my girlfriend of a year and a half. I love her wholeheartedly and want to encourage her to live a life that she is proud of. Saturday through today have been full of mood swings from her BPD and I don't know how to help her. Tonight I had to leave because she was yelling at me, and we needed distance. Later she called but would not answer what was up. I asked he if it was okay if I let her go and she said yes. When I said goodnight, she hung up without responding. I love this girl, and when she is doing well she is the most wonderful person to be around. I do want to spend the rest of my life with this girl hence why I proposed. I can't condone the behavior when she rages and I don't know how to constructively address it. 

P.S. as a disclaimer I am not perfect I know this, my issues come into play as well.

edit*: If I should post this to /r/relationshipadvice please let me know. I posted here because I know that proportionately females are diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and wished to get at least some input specifically from those with BPD. I will remove and post over there if that is the correct action.
