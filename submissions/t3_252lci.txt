TwoX-ers who don't like this change,
One of the things I especially liked about this sub was the feeling of a close-knit community. I am a regular poster under another username and this was the only sub I ever really frequented on reddit. 

Has the idea of setting up a new sub been discussed or set up yet? There are countless posts about this new change each with hundreds of comments so it's hard to filter through. I was just wondering if any user actually intends on making a new sub?
