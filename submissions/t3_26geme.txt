So last night after the BBQ that I went to, I had a quite unpleasant experience. 

I am friends with a married couple. The wife was my professor in undergrad. She and her husband are people I like a lot. They're both about 9 and 12 years older than me respectively. I've been living at home since I moved back after getting my Masters and their place has been mostly a welcoming refuge. 

Last night however, my professor friend went to bed early. I and her husband were finishing out drinks in the kitchen. He is like an older brother to me. We were talking about I don't even remember what and he comes out with "So, why have you gotten fat?"

**Why have you gotten fat?**

Typically I appreciate blunt talk. This guy specializes in blunt forthrightness. But goddamn he might as well have stabbed me. I have gained a lot of weight in the past few years, for a variety of reasons. I feel absolutely horrible about myself and extremely ashamed of what I've become. To have him say something like this, even though I don't think he meant to hurt me, was like a confirmation that I am indeed as disgusting looking as I thought.

I wanted to leave on the spot but I had had a few drinks and had already planned to stay at their house in the guest room. He started asking why I let myself get so fat, what my hangup was, etc etc. I just felt totally ambushed. I wanted to die and have the earth swallow me up. I sat out on the back porch for awhile and contemplated just hopping the fence and running away. Instead I slept in the guest room and when I woke up about 6am I made my bed, grabbed my stuff and beat it out of there. I didn't wanna see either of them.

I don't even know how to feel. His words are echoing on a constant loop in my head. I'm supposed to be hanging out with them and another girlfriend tomorrow. Now I'm not even sure that I want to go.

Maybe I'm being foolish. I just wanted to share.
