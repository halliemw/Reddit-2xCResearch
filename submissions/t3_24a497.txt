I wanted to try something with you TwoX, the above statement can be a positive or a negative, you can address it to whoever you want. Just a little bit of backstory as to why I'm sharing this with you.

My older sister and I have a very warm and frigid relationship, she's two years older than me and never stood up for me when I was teased in school, and I carry resentment around for that, is that childish? Possibly, but all I want is for her to acknowledge that it hurts me, because I have always had her back, I will always defend her because she's my sister and that's what we're supposed to do for each other.

I have yet to share my own with her, but filling out the statement has really helped me pin down where my frustrations with her lie the most. 

So this is my statement to my sister: "When you disregard my feelings, it makes me feel insignificant."

My is obviously a negative, but yours can be a positive. My hope is that maybe it will help you have a conversation with someone that is long overdue like mine is with my sister. Much love and internet hugs.
