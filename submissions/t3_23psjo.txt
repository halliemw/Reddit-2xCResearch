I found out yesterday that I am pregnant and I'm still in shock. I've been with my boyfriend for three years and we've never once had a serious scare so this completely took us by surprise. 
I am very close with my friends and family but I have a feeling that I would experience disappointment and judgement from them if I told them what I was doing, even though I'm certain most of them are pro-choice.
The struggle is that I am 23, in a stable relationship, and finished school so it seems like I am someone who could potentially raise a child. But I'm not in a position in the least to be a mother. I have no money, my boyfriend has massive amounts of debt, we're both pursuing artistic careers and having a child would shatter us.
My boyfriend has been really supportive and has been my shoulder to cry on (multiple times) since I found out. I guess why I'm posting though is that I still feel lonely, nervous and especially am fearing how this will affect me for the rest of my life.
Any words of encouragement, or personal experiences would be so appreciated.
