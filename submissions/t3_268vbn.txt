Does anyone else have crippling anxiety about dating/sex things? I [21 F] have dated and slept with a handful of guys, but it hasn't really changed the amount of anxiety i have about dating someone or sleeping with someone new. I lie about having plans to avoid spending a lot of time with them, even when I'm really into them. I am terrified about sleeping with them, even though I've had a decent amount of experience with that. I'm afraid that it makes me come off as disinterested in physical things because I accidentally avoid it a bit. Once I eventually get comfortable with them, it's less of a big deal, but they have to put up with a whole lot of crazy before then.
I just recently started seeing this guy that I really like, and am looking for advice to not screw things up :)
Thanks, guys!
