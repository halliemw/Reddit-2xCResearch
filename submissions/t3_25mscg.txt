I've had heavy/long periods my entire life....was on Pill for many years, now off of it

Two questions:

1. Is there anything to do to lessen heavy flow? Jesus Christ I bled all over my bathroom this morning, it was like a slasher movie was being filmed. 

2. Does an IUD help to lessen flow over time? (I already have one DS, and would like another in the future)
