Male Pharmacy Student here trying to get some perspective:
I am studying different forms of contraception right now and I'm just looking for some insight on experiences with birth control pills:

* What made you pick pill vs patch vs nuva ring vs IUD?
* If you picked the pill, why not the weekly patch or the 3 week nuva ring? (To me it seems like an easier option)
* Any super bad effects from the type that you used?


Thanks in advance for the help!
