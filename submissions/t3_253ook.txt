Hi--
I am trying to combat the issue I read on here all of the time, the issue of "I'm an adult woman in a relationship, not looking for dating, but trying to make some friends".  The idea that I had was to start a book club.  I plan to have people meet in a public area the first few meetings, but does anyone have ideas for great ways to make a new book club successful?  I'd appreciate book ideas, meeting ideas, marketing ideas, anything.
