Hello all. I'm pretty sure this is the wrong sub for this question, but I can't think of anything more appropriate. 
It's my birthday tomorrow. I'm gonna be 24. I don't normally do anything special for birthdays but I wanted to do something for it this year. But here's the problem. I'm in a small university town in Scotland, I don't really have any friends here to spend the day with and I'm very low on funds. I was just wondering if any of you had any ideas as to what I could do by myself to make it seem less like a regular day, and more like a birthday. So far on my list is: 
1. Watch Fridays Agents of Shield. 
2. Watch Avengers. 
3. Read the magazine I've been saving. 
So something along those lines would be good, nothing fancy or expensive, but something a bit more...exciting? Anything's better than sitting inside all day watching movies alone on my laptop.
