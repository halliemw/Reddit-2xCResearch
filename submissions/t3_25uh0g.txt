Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm 28 (F) and I recently have found myself attracted to a 24 (M) gay co-worker. I am in a happy, committed relationship with my boyfriend of 6 years.

Co-worker (CW) and I get along really well in general. We have similar personalities, and we are always on the same wavelength. I can't say I find myself physically attracted to him, but very much emotionally. I find myself thinking about him a lot - and want to just BE near him. Not only does this make me think "oh my god, am I not emotionally satisfied in my currently relationship?" but also "why am I thinking this way about someone who would never be attracted to me that way?" 

I am basically just extremely, extremely confused. I have a history of craving male attention (not actively getting it, but always wanting it). I love my boyfriend very much and would never cheat, and I really am satisfied emotionally and physically in our relationship (or so I think??)

Am I just really liking CW as a friend, and wanting to get to know him more? Any advice/help/experiences would be appreciated!
