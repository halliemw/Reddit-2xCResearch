The older I get the more I realize how much bullshit us women have to go through, on a practically daily basis. I'm not saying men don't go through things (we know you do). I am simply stating that I don't know any women who haven't experienced a form of sexism or sexual assault and I am wondering if other women feel the same.

Examples of my own experience include:

- Being laughed at by male counterparts during a meeting in which I was presenting an idea
- Being surrounded by a group of men who told me they wanted to "do bad things to me and get in that pu$$y".
- Having my tits grabbed more than once by random guys
- Having my ass slapped or grabbed in a bar
- Being told by an ex that I (and most women) look like shit without makeup on
- Being called a bitch or a c*nt for not smiling at a guy when he asks me to

And the list goes on. 

EDIT: Oh my goodness! Thank you all so much for your responses. I'm going to work on slowly responding to each of you. My best friend came into town last night and we went out...I didn't think much about this post, but woke up to all of your thoughtful, inspiring stories. 

The older I get the less numb I become. It's very eye opening to see how many of us have experienced various forms of sexism and sexual assault.
