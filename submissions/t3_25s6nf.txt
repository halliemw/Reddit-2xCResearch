Most of my physical experiences with guys have almost always lead to sex and I want to try it a different way. I am talking to a guy that seems genuinely interested in getting to know me and I we have plans for next week for a date. I want to know how you can stop a make out session or anything else without making the guy feel like you are disinterested. Is it awkward to say something about it at the moment? I don't want to stop kissing, get up, and be like 'OK Cya later!' Seems a little cold. What have you done in the past?
