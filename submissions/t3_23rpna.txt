Someone showed me this scale yesterday - http://faculty.wwu.edu/djack/resources/STSS_Scale.pdf and it seems like I max out many of these items. I understand logically that I do not have to feel this way. It causes me extra stress and leads to neglect for my own self-care. 

I [24F] am a graduate student so there's a lot on my plate with that. I recently (~2 months) got into a relationship with a great guy and don't want to fall into the same patterns.

Does or has anyone else felt like this before? 
Did anyone used to be like this, but changed? If so, what steps did you take?
