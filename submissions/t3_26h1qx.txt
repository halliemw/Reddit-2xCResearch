Are there any?  I'm looking for some simple, non-nylon, no frills, no lace underwear in a size XS.  I've done all the googling and I can't find any!  I'm not looking for granny panties, and I'm not looking for lingerie.  I just want something that is comfortable, not embarrassing if someone sees it, and in my size.  Preferably in black?  Please help.  I can never find anything in my size and if there is anyone else out there who is petite and has found the holy grail of panties then please share your secrets!

Also, I'm just looking for solid colors, preferably black.  I can't stand all those gaudy designs they put on underwear these days.
