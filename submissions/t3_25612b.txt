I read in a previous thread from this subreddit outlining this basic premise

1) Scumbag Stacy and Good Girl Gina stories are based on [seemingly biased] events on 'girl-to-guy' relations, typically involving the poster's reaction to a sexual thing. (ie, She performed a sexual favor vs She didn't perform a sexual favor.)

2) Scumbag Steve stories are NOT based on 'guy-to-girl' relations, and less frequently including sexual things.

I'd like to hear what your thoughts are on this. Are these trends actually a thing? Is it fine that it's a consistent trend? What are some reasons the trend exists? What affects could it be having on women that see these memes/stories regularly?

Thanks!
