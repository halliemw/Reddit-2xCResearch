I don't know if anyone will see this because it's so late (at least where I'm from) but it's seriously bothering me. I am 16 years old, and a sophomore in high school. This Saturday I went to prom, and I was super excited and spent all day getting ready with my best friend. Well, we show up, and of course I see how beautiful everyone looked and was running around complimenting people. 

I was standing with a group of girls talking about my dress and such, and mentioned the rib cage size was a little big on me and I was a little worried about basically flashing everyone. One of the girls then said "you think your worried? I'm wearing a strapless, and you don't have to worry because you have no boobs." 


I was naturally incredibly offended at that point and wanted to say something but decided to not let her spoil my fun. I also had a girl later on tell me she thought I had very high levels of testosterone because of "how andro and boyish I look" (I have short hair, but so does she) and how my "body type is" whatever that means. She said that because we were talking and I said something about jokingly about "well maybe I have a guys brain, thinking about sex all the time" (I'm bisexual)


Both of theses comments hurt because these girls were my friends, not close friends but we still hung out socially on occasion, and one girl looks just as "boyish and andro" as the next girl, and the other girl has more boobs because she's a bigger girl, it's her body type. But if I commented on her having a lot more tummy than me, I know all hell would break lose. 


I didn't let her ruin my fun though. I got hit on plenty of times that night by guys who don't seem to care about my small stature and short hair. But it has gotten me thinking how uncool it is to put down anyone's body, especially after you know they put a lot of work into looking good. Rant over.
