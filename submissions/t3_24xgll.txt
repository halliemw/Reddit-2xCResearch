hi guys, so I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I got a few red bumps on my genitals that aren't like normal razor burn, and after much googling I'm pretty sure I have herpes. I made an appointment for tomorrow to get tested but in the meantime I'm really bummed out. I have a loving boyfriend who will love me even if I do have it but I feel so bad for exposing him to it without even knowing. I've had some irresponsible sex in the past but of course never dreamed this would happen to me. I don't know what I'm looking for, just comforting words would be nice. I don't know what to do. If I do have herpes I'm just afraid of what the rest of my life is going to look like.

EDIT: So I went to the doctor and she almost laughed in my face and said "there's no way in hell that's herpes." So my google-fu is not as great as I thought it was. I'm really grateful I'm not infected, but thank you all so much for your insight, it really did calm my nerves and made me realize that even if I were infected, it wouldn't be such a big deal, and that I'd have a lot of people to turn to.
