This may be inconsequential to most of you, but it's a huge victory for me.  Throwaway because my family/friends know my usual username.

I used a tampon today, for the first time!  It didn't even really hurt - it was just a different experience than anything I've felt before.

I've never done it before due to anxiety and pain issues...  I went to physical therapy to help see if it was a physical issue or a mental one - turned out to be a little bit of both.  My physical therapist gave me some dilators to help with the physical difficulties, and she also gave me some ways to cope with the anxiety (breathing exercises, ways to focus on the feelings of pain and notice when they subside).

Because I've never been able to use a tampon, I've never felt like a normal woman.  It feels great overcoming that hurdle.  :)
