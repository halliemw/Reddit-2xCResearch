I have had the nexplanon implant for almost a year. Since it was inserted I have had terrible breakouts and dark spots, I have had my period for over 40 days three separate times and now I get a full cycle every two weeks. My emotions are out of whack and I get panic attacks frequently. My  obgyn told me to "give it time". Help! Does it get tolerable or should I get the implant removed?
