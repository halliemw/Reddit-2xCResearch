Hey TwoX,

 I was wondering how all you fabulous ladies deal with PMS. My moon time should be starting anytime soon and I feel like utter crap. I have no drive to do anything and I don't even feel like talking to anyone, etc.

What are your suggestions in terms of shaking this feeling of hopelessness off? What made you get your drive back on? It's when I PMS, that I slowly become convinced that the world doesn't like me and doesn't care. I know it's not the truth and I'm constantly reminding myself this. What do you do to keep this feeling at bay when the storm comes?
