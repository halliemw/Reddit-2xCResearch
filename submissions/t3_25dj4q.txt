Over the weekend my boyfriend of 2 years [M20] and I [F21] were at a party with a lot of mutual friends.  My boyfriend was talking to one of my really good friends.  I made this friend in a class, and he also knows my boyfriend partially through me and partially because we are in the same community on campus.  My friend is openly gay and well aware that my boyfriend and I are not only dating but that it's a very serious, committed relationship.

At one point during the party, my friend decides that he is getting some signals from my boyfriend and proceeds to passionately kiss him.  My boyfriend steps back and manages a "wait, n-" and he tries it again.  My boyfriend immediately leaves the situation and tells me and we leave.

At first my boyfriend is adamant about me not telling anyone and he feels really bad for putting my friend "in such an awkward situation."  The next day my friend kind of laughs it off with my boyfriend says sorry I misread the situation and has no intention of telling me that it even happened.

I am livid.  I confided in a few close friends and they all are telling me it's not a big deal.  "He was confused."  "That's just how gays are."  "He probably just wanted a quick hookup."  He's my friend, that's my boyfriend, I don't really see where there is any gray area.  If this were one of my girlfriends it would be completely justifiable if I didn't want to talk to her anymore.  I don't see how this is any different just because my friend is male.  Also he put my boyfriend in a very nonconsensual situation. Nobody sees how this is so wrong.  Am I completely unjustified?  I feel like everyone is really underevaluating the situation.  My boyfriend only came around after I made him picture one of his friends doing the same to me.
