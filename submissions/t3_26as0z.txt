Throwaway, SO is a redditor... My older sister and I were on the phone the other day. She is recently married, and I am soon to be. We're both career-minded, working women, and we love our SOs, who are men, very much. They are good guys, who support our careers and are willing to do half of the "third shift" work at home. 

The problem is, at least in our experience so far, they don't really know WHAT to do to help. They will do a chore, if asked to do it. They will make dinner, if you tell them what to cook. If you tell them to "think it up" they will usually default to one recipe they know well. They will swing by the grocery store, but they have no idea what's in the pantry and what we might need. I think it's an issue of socialization - we were trained by our capable mother to do the "invisible work" of keeping a pantry inventory, keeping the calendar, thinking up what we'll cook for dinner. Doing "half" the housework (or, a fair share) to me should include knowing what needs to be done and when, and taking the initiative. We both have about the same standards for what "clean" means, so that isn't the issue. But for example, if the carpet needs to be steam cleaned once a year (silly, but go with me here), I don't want to be the only one who knows when, and who to call, and what to do to prep the house. He should be just as capable. I have to figure things out as I go along. So should he. 

My big question is this: how do we start our relationships right, and communicate this problem to them, without sounding like we aren't grateful that they are willing to help? I want to be a wife, and I want to keep my career, and I don't want to be his mother. I think he wants that too. Help, please. Men and women - how have you jumped this hurdle?
