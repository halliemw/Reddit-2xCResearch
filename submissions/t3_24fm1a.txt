I work in a call center that has several lines of business. Last month I was promoted (based on what I thought was my numbers being almost double that of what goal was) to the final department before supervising/training/etc. This is a huge deal for me. I have been struggling with depression and have had issues with not being able to perform well under stress and so I felt like I was finally able to be a functioning adult in the real world.

Tonight my roommate and I invited a couple that we work with over to have cake and ice cream (they also live very close to us) and as it usually goes since we were work friends the topic turned to work. In the process of talking one of them mentions the "only reason I was brought over was because senior manager wanted to work with roommate because he thinks shes pretty" and then "oh the only reason you didn't get moved to this spot was because you and roommate have to be on the same schedule" this spot being a brand new team that is literally being set up for failure so that they can fire them.

I'm really hurt. I don't know how to process this. I'm mad that it's being seen as I didn't earn this promotion. Senior manager would consistently speak to my roommate about things and not me in regards to our schedule. She is more outspoken but I feel like I am just this barnacle attached to her now. That I need to separate myself from her for my success to be recognized, or if I do and make waves then am I going to be fired?

This is something that was brought up in my own home so its not something I can go to HR about. Or can I? I feel like this has deflated my confidence about everything I felt I earned since September and undermines my joy about being successful. How do I even handle this? I'm not ready to bring this up to my roommate because its not her fault shes conventionally pretty and very extroverted but this is really hurting me.
