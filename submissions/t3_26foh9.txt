I was in London walking to a cafe with my boyfriend the other day and we passed this guy who was shouting at women walking by.

I couldn't make out what he was saying to them but they all ignored him anyway, probably taking him for a drunk or homeless person or whatever.

But as I passed him, looks like it was my turn. I should preface this by saying that I'd come from work and so had a messenger bag with me (the type that goes across one shoulder) and I just so happened to be wearing a dress. The guy yelled at me that I should move my bag strap as it was blocking the view of my 'amazing' cleavage (it wasn't even a low cut dress).

Normally if I was on my own I'd just ignore him, but as my boyfriend was with me this time I had the courage to shout back, basically telling him to fuck off.

What really bothered me though was that this was a busy thoroughfare in London and not one person batted an eye at this kind of behaviour. It may not have been especially abusive or aggressive but it still made me incredibly uncomfortable and more than a little intimidated (having social anxiety anyway makes walking down the street stressful enough at times). It's almost like that kind of behaviour is deemed as acceptable.
