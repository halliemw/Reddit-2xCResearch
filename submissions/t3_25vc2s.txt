Mine was when I drove a Suburban that had a finicky carburetor.  I stopped to put gas in, and had to adjust the carb while I was stopped. 

I'm only 5 foot 2. I had to climb into the engine compartment to begin with. So when I was getting back down, the underwire of my bra got caught in the hood latch. The hood latch was just high enough that I was stuck on my tiptoes and couldn't stand flat or climb back up on the bumper. 

I had to try to extract myself in the middle of an extremely busy gas station while every one laughed at me.
