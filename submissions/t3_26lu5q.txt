I like food. I love cooking and I love wine. Its a big part of my life and I always eat in moderation and yet I still feel pressure to be eating salads and fruits all of the time. I'm 5ft 7, 11 stone and in all honesty most of the time I'm okay with that. But recently I haven't been, everywhere I look there are tips on losing weight, healthy lifestyles and getting the body I've always dreamed of and not doing these things, not being "healthy", it just makes me feel like a failure. 

I run, I eat fruit and veg and I drink alot of water, but I know I'm never going to look like those girls. I'm always going to be a bit chubby, have armpit fat and a lack of a thigh gap, I just wish I didn't feel like such a failure for not wanting to do all this stuff. I don't want to exercise everyday or drink fruit smoothies, or detox. I want to enjoy myself. 

Am I the only one that feels like this?
