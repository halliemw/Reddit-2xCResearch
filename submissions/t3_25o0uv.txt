Both of us are 20 and graduated college last year. I live several timezones away from my family and support myself, he's actively looking to do the same. 

We were best friends for a year and then started dating around 6 months ago. Both of us are rationally confident that we'd be more than comfortable spending the rest of our lives together and have discussed engagement in the near future. 

What's the rush, you ask? We're both surprisingly sure about each other. We've decided to wait until marriage for sex, and moving in together before then wouldn't encourage that decision, nor would it make our families very happy. We're just excited to start life together. 

He's already discussed it with his family and they're supportive. I'm terrified of confiding in my mom because she's wise to a fault sometimes. She would highly encourage waiting for both emotional and financial reasons, and while I clearly understand that, I also just want to be with my best friend. 

Are we crazy? I have no idea how to even ask my mom for advice without her thinking I'm irrational on the subject. I know that other couples get engaged after a few months and go on to thrive in wonderfully long marriages. 

TL;DR Best friends/SOs wanting to start a life together after a few months of dating. Need objective opinions on our sanity and how to approach my mom for advice.
