I woke up this morning to a lovely PM asking me what colour my nipples were.

I know there's no way of knowing where this user found me (I also posted on 2XL) or how he knew I was a woman, and I know the same thing could have just as easily happened before the sub went default, but I suspect it's not a coincidence, since I've never been harassed on Reddit before. (Personally, I think the hype around going default is probably stirring up more problems than the move itself, but either way it sucks to be a long-time member of this sub right now)

Of course it's not like the moderators have any way of preventing nasty PMs, but honestly Reddit is such a shitty place for women and TwoX was a nice refuge. I'm sure it will be again some day, but I would say I'm definitely more hesitant to participate on here for now.

(By the way, if anyone wouldn't mind telling me how to report my PM-er to the moderators, that would be awesome!)

Edit: In the time since I first posted, I have received one PM calling me a bitch and requesting ass picks, and another one calling me a retard and a sexist. So that's cool.
