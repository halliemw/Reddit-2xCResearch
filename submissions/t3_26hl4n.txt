Hey all, I've been using my diva cup for a long time -- at least 3 years maybe more. I love it. I've had issues getting it in perfectly sometimes, and it does shift and poke me slightly sometimes (my cervix sits at an angle or something according to the GNO) but for the most part it's been an amazing and freeing way to deal with my period. 

Right now and last month I've been getting irritation from putting it in and taking it out. It feels like I've nearly teared my vaginal wall, close to the opening and it's extremely uncomfortable. It feels painful and itchy (most likely itching from attempts at healing.) I just got back from camping so it wasn't the ideal situation to be putting it in (it was dry, at home I rinse it when I change it out.) 

Has this happened to any of you ladies? Is it time to replace my cup? The stem has been trimmed quite short since I first got it due to my angle and the slight poking. I could go back to using pads at night but I really don't want to do that either. Perhaps I just need to give my vagina a break or try a different model? How often do you ladies replace yours and how did you know it was time to replace? 

Thanks in advance for any help! 

EDIT: I was reading the Diva Cup website about the sizing yesterday and realized I've been using the smaller one but am about to turn 30, and it says the larger (width, same length) model is meant for those 30+. I wonder if it could be too narrow so it's sliding out of place while I wear it?
