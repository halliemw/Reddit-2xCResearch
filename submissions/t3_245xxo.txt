Hi everyone! I have just discovered your lovely sub and while I was over on the tampons thread a question popped into my mind. 

Some background first: I'm 21 years old next week and due to vulvodynia (fixed now though!) I only stared using tampons 2 periods ago. I'm a swimming teacher so I'm in the pool 3-4 days a week either one or two times a day and I HATE wearing tampons. Over in the tampons thread someone brought up menstual cups and their amazingness. I've been skipping periods (on the Pill) in order to get away with not using tampons while at work but due to a blood disorder I have that's no good for me (my body hoards iron and it gets stored in my organs which is not good - my period gets rid of some this excess iron). 

The question/s:
Those of you that use mensrual cups, what is their effectiveness while you're in the water?
Does it leak at all?
Is it comfortable for lots of movement? (My job is very physical and I go to the gym ~4 times a week). 

Thankyou in advance ladies :)
