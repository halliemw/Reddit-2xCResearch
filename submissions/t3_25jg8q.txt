Im a thick girl, always have been. Im thick in the thighs and can remember the first time I wore a dress and had my skin between my thighs irritated and tearing because of friction from my thighs rubbing together. My mother told me rub baby powder between your legs, quick fix never had a problem again. 

Today, I am a respiratory therapist who's on her feet for most of a 12 hour shift and scrubs have become major part of my wardrobe. However I noticed that I end up having to buy a new pair of scrub pants every so often because the material is worn and tearing from thigh friction. I simply fix the issue by buying more pants.

 I was just curious if there were any other women out there with this issue and if so do you have any other ways with dealing with this. Im just curious and tired of spending money on scrubs.
