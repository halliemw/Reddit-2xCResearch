Okay so using a throwaway because this is a little sensitive (pun intended). I just wanted a bit of advice (and sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I just always find you folks to be very insightful and compassionate!): 

My boyfriend is rather well-endowed (nothing monstrous but big enough to be causing the following problem) and we both enjoy rougher sex. As a result, I find myself bleeding a very small amount after every encounter (as in couple of drops on the tissue). I suspect he may be hitting my cervix, but I'm not sure as it's not particularly painful during the act or after (maybe a bit of pressure, if anything). 

This doesn't perturb me too much since it isn't painful but I just wanted to know if it ought to. Should I speak to my doctor about it? Go easier in the bedroom? I don't want to be causing any permanent damage to my lady bits in the name of wholesome bedroom fun. 

Please let me know your thoughts, especially if you have any first-hand experience.

**TL;DR My boyfriend is well-endowed and our rough sex makes me bleed every time. Should I be concerned?**
