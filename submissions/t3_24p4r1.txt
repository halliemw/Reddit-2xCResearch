So I'm fat. Morbidly obese, actually. I don't really look it in my clothing. I can walk and run (short bursts) and fit in seats. Most of the time. So I thought "yeah, I'm fat, but not morbidly obese. Stupid outdated BMI." I still think that the BMI is outdated, but...

I watched a couple shows on people who were morbidly obese yesterday. At first, it confirmed my beliefs. I am not nearly as bad off as those people. I can shop in walmart and target and a couple stores in the mall. I can move and I am independent. I don't look like that. Those poor people.

Then this morning after my shower, I decided to snap some pics. I am trying to eat healthier and exercise more and wanted some before and after shots. I am almost in tears now after really looking at my body. My legs may not have folds of fat hanging from them, but I can see where they are starting. My face is starting to look swollen all the time. My belly is a train wreck. And my back and ass...my former sexy junk in the trunk, looks like a dented, creased, and very square bag of flesh. Rolls. I have them. "Bat wings" for arms? Check. Extra chin? Yup. And my skin...the "insulin spots" cover my back, breasts, and the back of my neck. Eczema has eaten my feet and is sprouting in small patches on my body.

I have about 100 lbs to lose. And I have PCOS and insulin resistance as my road blocks, as well as a desk job, and friends and relatives who love to eat and enable. How will I ever do this?!?!
