She said she was going swimming and wouldn't be gone long. That was *nine hours* ago. NINE. Im stuck here with no food. She wont answer her phone. I have work in the morning and I'm ready to go home. 

How should I handle this? 

Edit: Okay, it has been 11.5 hours since the mom left to go swimming. Calling her one more time, then calling the police.

Edit: tried calling and her phone is off.  

Edit: called the police. They were extremely rude and told me to just call the hospitals and see if she's there. Not that that's rude, but the police station acted really annoyed that I called. 

Final edit: She finally got home around 6:30 a.m. and claimed to have lost her wallet so she couldn't pay me. She was also intoxicated. So badly so that she was barely coherent. I called CPS and told them about the house (trash and cigarette butts everywhere, no food, no baby wipes, hardly any clothes, drunk mom coming home when her son would be awake soon). Doubt they'll do anything but it'll be good to have on record if something worse happens or if this happens frequently. Going to leave it alone for now, and hopefully she doesn't have the nerve to ask me to babysit for her again. I'm going to warn all my babysitting friends about her.
