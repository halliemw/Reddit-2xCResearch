I don't take the time to appreciate my life enough. I feel so often like I'm waiting for the next big thing that I forget just how lovely today is. 

Today I'm wearing a pretty dress and my favourite red shoes. I'll get to spend my lunch hour reading a book. I'm working a job that isn't the most fulfilling or well paid but after being unemployed since graduating in July I'm really thankful to be employed and the people I work with are funny and friendly. I have friends that are willing to travel across the country just to come and hang out with me for a weekend.  I have a mad family who love me and embarrass me at every occasion and a husband who doesn't care if my breath stinks in the morning and congratulates me when I fart. After work I'll go and meet my husb and some friends for a drink and then go home and have a bath and put a facemask on and do whatever the hell I want. I'm healthy, happy and life is good. 

Edit: thanks for all the responses! Your happy days are making mine even more marvellous, yay!
