Mad props to the Peruvian health care system for being easily accessible and VERY inexpensive. Went to the first dr to clean my terribly blocked ears... decided to visit the derm while I was there because I'm 26 and suffer from persistent acne on my chin and forehead. Derm took 1 look at me and said I probably had cycts. Im thinking. ..yeah right, lady....26 years and multiple visits to drs abour my skin in the US and nobody has ever mentioned that.  I go to the gyno every year! No problem! She suggested I visit their gyno and get a new bc that would also treat the cysts that I "probably have. " I visit the gyno and she said "yes you probably have cysts.  Go get an ultrasound." She writes a new script and I'm still incredulous but nervous. ... two people have told me so far I probably have things growing in my body.  I go get a transvaginal ultrasound and lo and behold. ..I have multiple MULTIPLE cysts... some of them rather large. .. on both of my ovaries. Its scary but I'm happy to know the cause of my acne and now I have a way to treat it!
Again...credit to the medical system of Peru... where a foreigner with no insurance can walk into private clinics and make appointments the same day and pay 10 us dollars for each appointment and only 20 for a full ultrasound with photos.
