I'd been talking to one of my cousins, and she's been having a hard time with life. I thought I'd share some of my rough growing up (Childhood trauma/ ptsd/ rape / etc) to reach out and connect with her. 

Turns out her parents read all of her messages, so now my aunt/uncle know all this shit on me, that I never intended them to know. 

Ugh. 

I'm 26, she's 18, for more of a frame of reference.

I'm just so frustrated, not only are they invading her privacy - but they've invaded mine as well. Now I don't even feel like I can reach out to her anymore, because everything I say will be read by lots of people, and I really don't need that kind of shit in my life. 

Grr.
