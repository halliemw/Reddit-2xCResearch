There us this guy in two of my classes (community college) and we kind of chat and laugh, but he knows I'm accounted for. He's actually pretty amusing but in the last two weeks he's started making some mostly innocent sort-of-about-sex jokes like "its that what your boyfriend calls you in bed?" Kind of stuff that would just make Mr blush like hell. Occasionally he would like rub my neck, right before class started, which creeped me out, but he's like that with everyone, and damn my neck hurts. 

So long story short, I didn't tell him no at the beginning and it got worse. Like him talking about undressing me and how hard it was to restrain himself (probably joke but fuck that) in the middle if my schools tutoring center! Where I work! 

Well I got pissed. I took a quick walk to my car so I could think and not flip shit. When I came back, I calmly told him we had a problem, he crossed a line, and it would be okay if he apologized. And he did! Because guys aren't total scum. He was even normal again after a while.

I feel pretty accomplished and just wanted to share. I was so mortified before, but couldn't do anything past my blushing. I had to get mad, but I was calm about it.

Edit: that probably read like hell because I'm on mobile.
