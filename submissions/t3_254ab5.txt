Throwaway because my SO knows my reddit account.  

I have been with my SO for many years (both 23). I have grown up with the idea of sex being "bad" and not what a "good girl" does (my family is *very* prudish). It took me a long time to move past this and I finally started feeling comfortable having sex (some of the "guilt" still remains - gosh, I even feel kind of guilty admitting that I have sex in writing here).  

We only use condoms, but we want to be safer and he especially does. He's been asking me to go onto the pill for about a year now but I just don't know how I feel about it.  
  

 Here are my reasons why:    

1. I don't want to pump my body full of hormones. I don't want to have to take a pill every single day at the same time and I don't want to accidentally have my parents come across my pill packet where all hell will break loose (I stay at my parents home on the weekends and holidays, I am not moving out until I graduate I don't live with SO yet).      

2. I feel like shit during my pre-menstrual time. I have bad bouts of PMS, I get angry for no reason, I hate everyone, I cry, I feel fat, I get spotty. PMS comes about due to the high levels of hormones, surely going on the pill will result in me PMS-ing *constantly*. Is this true?  
  
3. Side effects!!! I know "most women" don't have side effects but who's to say I won't be one of the women who do? My main concerns are: weight gain, the PMS thing I mentioned in point 2, decreased libido, having a "cloudy mind" i.e. not being as sharp as usual (I actually read this on reddit, another user's experience of going off the pill and immediately seeing benefits mentally).    

4. I am confident with NFP. I know when I ovulate, I know when the safe period is.  
  

I feel very pressured that I must start the pill and my SO has withdrawn all sexual activity until I start it. TwoX, please make me feel better about starting the pill?
