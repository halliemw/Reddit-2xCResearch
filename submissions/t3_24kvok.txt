So I just went in a couple weeks ago to my university health clinic for my first pap smear. I only started having sex about a year ago, and have only been with two guys. Since going on birth control around 5 months ago, I've noticed a change in discharge, which can be normal at times I've heard. But after I let my bf come inside the first time, I immediately had what seemed to be symptoms of BV. I used some probiotic supplements, and as long as I don't let him come inside me I'm fine. Since we're long distance right now, it hasn't been a problem because we haven't been able to have sex very often at all.

So to the part where I'm confused. I went in for my pap smear, and they post the results online. At the top the note from the doctor states that my pap smear is normal. But below under the specific results it reads, "a shift in vaginal flora suggestive of bacterial vaginosis". Should I call my doctor and ask about this? Is it something to be concerned about? or does it simply mean my pH right now is a little high? I unfortunately had the pap smear two days before getting my period, so perhaps that has something to do with it? I'm worried about it, and the office is closed until Monday morning. I'm just afraid that when my bf comes home in a couple weeks from school that its going to start back up. And I thought perhaps some people here could help me out with some insight or advice.
