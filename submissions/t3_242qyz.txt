Hey there,
So my SO and I have been trying to look into different forms of birth control. Neither of us are a fan of condoms, so she has been on the pill recently (don't know the brand off-hand), but we both agree that we need to find something else. She has tried multiple brands at the moment, and all of them have had serious negative effects - ranging from impacting her libido and period to mood itself. We've talked about it, and basically, while she does agree to stay on it until we find a better alternative, we both are in search of the easiest and safest method possible with as little an impact on our relationship and selves.

Neither of us are shy of a surgery - we're just worried things like a vasectomy aren't always temporary. We don't want kids now, yeah, but... you know. What if? We've also looked into the those implants (like implanon) and it looks like they often share side effects with the pill. At least she wouldn't have to take a pill every night, but it's still a serious consideration.

I care a lot about her, and I really want what is best for her. What are some of the best alternative birth control methods? We, of course, won't proceed with anything without seeking professional advice. We just both want a really good starting place.
