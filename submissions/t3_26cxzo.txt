So I'm 19F, never had penetrative sex, never really been able to wear a tampon comfortably, and I think I want to open up my hymen so I can a) wear tampons like a normal person and b) do some G-spot masturbation. My current plan involves a glass of wine, a rabbit vibrator, and gobs of lube. I've been researching this for about a month and found some helpful blog posts, as well as some diagrams that are making me think my hymen might be microperforate.

That's just what's going through my head right now, but I wanted to ask the 2XC community for their thoughts and input before I go for it. Throwaway because apparently problematic PMs are becoming a real thing for this sub.
