Hey all I've posted here once or twice, I'm a 29 yr old mtf transgendered girl.  I've been on hormones for a very short time, and I'm living in this limbo now that is so depressing.  A few ppl know about me, most don't, work doesnt, and I want to jump into femininity so badly but I just can't yet.  Not to mention now I'm changing physically so I certainly don't look super manly but not yet female either. 

I'm so worried about passing and being too tall, having feet too big, having a voice too deep, yet I want to just go out and be myself so much.  I wish I had the confidence to not care what ppl think but, we all do you know?  and its hard when youre going through a 2nd puberty essentially!

Cheer me up everyone :'(
