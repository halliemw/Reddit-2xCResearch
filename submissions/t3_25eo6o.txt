What could this be? I constantly need to pee I've never had a UTI and there's no burning nor discharge, though there is a weird feeling of still needing to pee after I'm done peeing. The pain won't go away either. I already ovulated this month and it doesn't feel like any cramp I've had before. Any idea what this may be? 

Also, I am going to the doc tmrw, just wondering if you guys had any insight on these symptoms?
