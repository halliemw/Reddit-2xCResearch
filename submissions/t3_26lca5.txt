Really disappointed right now. Looking to vent I guess. 

I'm just starting to get over a breakup and when this really cute guy came up to me and asked for my number, I kind of got my hopes up about him. He seemed like a really great guy and I was excited to get to know him. 

So I googled his name tonight, just to see what would come up. Here are a few gems from his Twitter: 

"you know whats worse than a loose pussy, a dirty smelly bitch ha thats what"

"if a girl dont know how to get down in bed, dont expect a second call #hoe"

"roses are red, sky blue suck my dick so i cum on you :)"


I'm just kind of grossed out and ashamed that I judged a person so wrongly. It's things like this that make me want to crawl back into bed and not bother with dating anymore. I feel like I'm never going to find anyone who measures up to my ex. 

EDIT: Tried to paraphrase his tweets a little so as to give him some privacy.
Also wanted to say **THANK YOU** to those who have commented being so supportive, we have such an amazing community here and it is so nice to find people who understand. It is great to see that some of you have gone through similar things, and dealt with a lot of less than decent romantic partners before finding someone who truly values you as a person. It gives me hope, I guess.
