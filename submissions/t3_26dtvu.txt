Throwaway, obviously.






So yesterday I decided to go running because I'm out of shape and I'd like to be in shape. I jogged out of my driveway and happened upon a flock of 12 year old girls walking along my sidewalk. I jogged to the side as close to the grass as I could. I mis-judged my footing and tripped on the sidewalks edge a little bit. Of course I tripped and whispered "whoops!" right as the girls were passing me.





They started laughing and snickering at me. As I fast-walked away I heard them talking about how funny I looked as I fell. I turned around to look at them and one of them was doing an exaggerated fall on the sidewalk. I almost ALMOST said something. One of them looks back at me and says "OMG she's looking at us". 




Who the heck is teaching these girls respect anymore? Whatever happened to empathy? If someone had tripped in front of me I would have at least asked if they were ok or something polite instead of being a bully about it.





Probably didn't help that I was bullied mercilessly in middle and high school for being really short. I probably forgot to mention that these girls were definitely taller than me. Maybe that made it easier for them? Idk. Don't know why I'm telling you guys this but you have always been a community I enjoyed here. Thanks for reading!
