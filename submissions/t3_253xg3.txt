My wedding is in a year from now. I do have some very few friends, but not so close to me. Also not alot of family here on either side of the bride or the groom.  Many known people from church but that's about it. It's all abit sad because we all know brides need all the help they can get. Sadly mother is not with us nor other close female relatives. It will definitely not going to be a traditional wedding since we will only be having 50-80 guests. It makes me feel actually lonely since I prefer reading, staying at home, and have peaceful time.
