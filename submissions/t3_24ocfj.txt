So I just realized I've been using Tampax (all different kinds; pearl, plastic, Compax, original cardboard, etc) for a million years because that's what my mom used and I just followed suit. Is there some magical cotton vag cork that does not leak? My period is never that heavy and only regular or light tampons fit without being uncomfortable, I'll pull them out once they start leaking and they're never even close to completely saturated. Is there a (non-deva cup, I've heard the wondrous tales but can't do it) solution? Or are my womanly flows just so manaical and determined to stain my panties that there is no hope?

Thanks ladies, y'all are the best.
