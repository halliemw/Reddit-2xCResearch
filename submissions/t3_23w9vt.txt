I just found out Easter Sunday that I am pregnant, despite having the Paragard IUD for a little over 2 years. I was hoping that it had just fallen out (I was especially hopeful considering I previously had the Mirena IUD fall out). An ultrasound yesterday confirmed that I am about 6 weeks pregnant, and the IUD was still in place, but baby was doing well with a little flicker of a heartbeat. Today I went to my doctor to see if the IUD could be safely removed and, sadly, it isn't a possibility.
Now I just have to sit and wait, and I'm really scared. I wasn't planning on having more children (I have a 4 year old daughter), but now I want this baby more than anything. There is about a 50% chance of losing the baby, and I can't even think about what would happen if I was part of the unlucky 50%.
I've searched the internet for support, and I found a few success stories of women carrying to term and having completely healthy babies, but there are just as many terrifying stories of miscarriage and stillbirth. I guess I'm just looking for any sort of positive thoughts and support, maybe some advice from those who have been in my situation. Thanks in advance :)
