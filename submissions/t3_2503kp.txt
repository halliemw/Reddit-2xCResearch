I talked with my SO this evening. We ended up having an hour long conversation where I told him honestly that I didn't think I could be a parent today-some day in the future (with him hopefully) but now I was not equipped. I asked him for his feelings and he said he felt like I was rejecting a piece of him and abandoning a child-our child. (Which honestly made me feel very guilty. Not guilty enough to justify bringing a child into the world though.)



I told him I felt differently but that his feelings were valid. But I decided to get the abortion because I'm just not ready to be a mother now. I hope to be someday, and I don't want to have a child before I can devote myself entirely to it. He said he sort of understood but still felt as though we were abandoning a child. I apologized to him. 



I asked him again if he could go with me to the clinic because (I know it's selfish) I really want someone I know well with me. He said he'd think about it and get back to me. I made an appointment for next week. 



So I'm not sure where our relationship will go from here. He still hates the idea of abortion but I think he hates it a little less now. I'll have to see how he feels afterwards. 



I'm really glad I made the appointment though because the thought of being a mother scares me even more than him leaving, although that's a really hard choice to make. Thanks to everyone who wrote. I appreciate it.
