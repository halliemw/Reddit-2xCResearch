I am a recent lurker but I had an experience today that I thought you ladies would be happy to hear about. My mother was very fashionable when she was a young lady. She would brag about how, as a 20-something, unmarried woman in India, she would wear a different sari to work every day- never repeating the same outfit twice! Her collection is massive even to this day, so I generally get my choice of sari if the occasion calls for one. Today, however, my mother dressed me in a very special sari. It was the sari my mother wore on the day she was welcomed in to my father's family after she got married. The sari is terribly old fashion but I felt so grateful to be able to wear such a special outfit. My mother could not stop telling me how proud she was and how beautiful I looked. (For reference, [here is my outfit for the day](http://imgur.com/aGZls1b).)

I would like to open up the floor to anyone else who has experienced something similar. Please share your special mother-daughter-clothing experiences! I would love to hear them!
