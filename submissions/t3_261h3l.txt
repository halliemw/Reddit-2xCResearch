Crosspost from /relationship_advice/ but I don't think it has to do 100% with the relationship as with myself, a woman[25]. So here it goes:

So, I have this "perfect" life: Lovely boyfriend [24/m] that l love, and who loves me, wonderful apartment, a good job in my field, a cat and a doge, best friends I see from time to time (because we live far) and so. But every now and then I wake up with the necessity of breaking up with everyhing and start fresh at some other place.
It has happened to me since I was a functioning and autonomous human, I got fed up and left everything to pursue some other thing, and so on. It didn't worried me because I was just accountable for myself, but now I have a lot of thing I love and I value and I don't want to loose them/hurt them, for a meaningless reason.
In the past months I moved from a former apartment, changed my hair style, moved the furniture around the house, adopted a dog and started a project to fullfill this need of constant change, but still every two months I have that leave-everything-behind feeling that I not commit to because I'm now a responsible and grown-up adult (right?) but I tell my boyfriend about it, in spite of honesty, and he's getting hurt by my recurring doubts.
Is this normal? It happens to (not everyone but) a fair amount of people?
It's just that I'm not true-happy and I should break up with things before I hurt (more) the people around me?
Or that's just the way I'm wired and I have to learn to deal with this nonesensic feeling and keep going?
