I hate to rant and complain at a generally positive place, but I need a listener today.

I've had constant headaches lately from feeling so stressed. I have so much schoolwork on topics that I feel like I simply can't grasp and it makes me feel really stupid. I feel so below average at everything. I don't have fun, I stress so hard over school just to get average grades, I hate my job, I have terrible self image issues that I'm constantly reminded of by looking at all the pretty girls everywhere I go, and I'm overwhelmed by trying to find a real person job with my college degree after/if I graduate by the end of the year, among other things. I'm also constantly tired of being so lonely in the romantic sense. Having never experienced anything, waiting around forever to experience a normal human feeling just sucks. I'm 21 and feel like I'm going nowhere with anything. I'm not depressed, but pretty unhappy and miserable lately. Isn't this supposed to be the prime time of my life?

I feel completely awful even complaining in the first place when there are people who have it way worse than me. So I can't complain to the very few friends or family interact with in the first place because they remind me of this. It doesn't make me feel better at all knowing there is worse out there, if it is intended to make me happier. ya know? My feelings are all over the place with everything I'm constantly thinking about.

I try going on walks or just stopping what I'm doing to collect myself. I try exercising. But these feelings aren't going away. Can anybody suggest any simple things I could do to feel better about myself and wherever life is taking me in the long run, in the meantime?
