My husband got a vasectomy a couple years ago. And since then I've noticed that when we have sex, I have a 'fishy' smell afterwards. It's gotten a little stronger over the past few years to the point where I find it kinda embarrassing. He says he doesn't notice it, I do shower every day, and douches scare me because they're not great for the tissues.

Is there anything to be done to stop this from happening? I seriously thought the tuna smell thing was a joke but I wouldn't be able to describe it any other way. Help?

(Advice from any corner is welcome, so lady-loving ladies, if this happens to you, I'd be interested to know.)
