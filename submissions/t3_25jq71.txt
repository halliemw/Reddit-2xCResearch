I initially wrote a longer post, damned near an essay, but it was really too much. Basically the questions boils down to the usual problems with using a single term to describe large groups of people with views that in this case range from the basic definition (those in favor of gender equality specifically as it relates to women), all the way to the the "All sex is rape" crowd (my personal idea of where the fringe is), and everything in between.

Since this ambiguity leads to strange outcomes like women themselves saying they no longer identify as feminists (and keep in mind they're not driven away by the fringe I just cited since that fringe makes up a fairly small population), I was wondering if people here see this uncertainty as a problem or just the realities of ambiguous language. Since XX seems to have a decent cross section of women and men, both activist and non, represented, I figured this might be a good place to post the question to gain insight into other people's perspective on things.
