Throwaway because boyfriend is on reddit. 

So, a little background, ever since I hit the sexual part of puberty I've had a very high sex drive all throughout high school. This of course continued into college when I met my current boyfriend. He was a virgin, so basically I was his first sexual experience. Since my sex drive was so high we had sex as often as possible, practically every day of the week. 

This continued until a sebaceous cyst on my vaginal entrance (I know, nasty) burst, then my high sex drive lowered a little bit. Then this year was particularly dramatic and I was having a ton of issues with anxiety and depression so I started taking zoloft/sertraline. I started at 20mg in January and now I'm on to 100mg. It's improved my mood a great deal, so I don't plan on taking a break at the moment. 

A common side effect of it, however, is a lowered sex drive. So instead of having sex 6-7 times a week, it's gone down to 2-3, sometimes less if I'm busy.

Now of course this hasn't gone well for my boyfriend. Since I practically trained him to having sex so much, I can understand that suddenly cutting down is difficult. However it saddens me to see him so disappointed when I say no. He appears to take it personally even though he understands I am on this medication. I am still indeed attracted to him, and no one else, but I just don't feel like having sex most of the time anymore. 

I've gone to two people about this, my mother and my therapist. Generally I see them as very supportive and loving people but their solutions to the problem have been frustrating. My mom suggested I skip a day or two of it and my therapist mentioned different SSRI's. 

While I'm pretty sure they would help I'm a little annoyed that **I'm** being seen as the one with the problem that needs fixing. I honestly don't think that sex 2-3 times a week is that unhealthy!

So, any ways of working things out with my boyfriend that do NOT involve changing my meds?
