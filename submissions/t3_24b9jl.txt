Hello ladies of 2X, 

I have decided to stop taking my birth control and no, I have no intention of having a child right now. I have been on the pill for more than 9 years now. 9 years that my hormones haven't been my own. 9 years of side effects. 9 years of taking the pill daily and trying to remember to pick it up(which is not a big deal just a mild annoyance really). 

I started taking birth control because my periods were out of control when I was 13. 9 years and puberty later, I just really feel like I'm poisoning myself at this point. Month over month, my side effects get worse and I'm so fed up. I've been on, I believe 8 different kinds and I haven't found 1 that I'm willing to deal with the side effects from. Am I asking too much?

Has anyone else just taken themselves off birth control? What was the out come? 

I'm just so fed up.  

Thank you for reading!
