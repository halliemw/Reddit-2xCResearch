Hi there. I'm asking for help because google has only shown me scary unrealistic outcomes.. as usual.

So here it goes. I have an incredibly irregular period. Sometimes it will be a week, two weeks late. It can be heavy or light, last an entire week or three days, you get it.. So I usually go by how my body feels and the week prior. The week prior to my periods, my breasts are sore and I'm more emotional and irritable than ever.

It seems that this week or the week before should have been when I start my period, but alas, all I got was four or five days ago just a bit of brown discharge. That sometimes indicates I'm going to start in the next few days.. But it's been too late now.

Having said all that, it seems obvious that it is implantation bleeding.. Except  I've been pregnant twice already and remember the symptoms very clearly, and I had a lot more symptoms with it. I was extremely sick, I hurt, I was tired, My breasts hurt more than ever.. And I don't have any of those symptoms. But then again, I think I got those symptoms after the bleeding. :/ But I had an abortion last march, and my period was very late when it did come last and before that I had some complications with it. I had an infection afterwards and had to be on a regiment of antibiotics for some time. 

I'm not sure if that has anything to do with how my period acts now, but I've read on scary google that it can be a factor.

So please, does anybody have any insight on what I should do or what is going on?? I don't keep track of my periods because they are so out of wack so I'm a little lost. I want to go to planned parenthood but I have no insurance or money at the moment.

Other details that might help.. I'm 23, very awful sleep schedule (Awful schedule with anything really..) use condoms but no birth control.
