I (20F) have been losing weight steadily, and healthily, for the past several months. My family, although I love them, have terrible relationships with food. They are all very large, and I was overweight all through high school until I moved out and became self-aware of what I was eating. 

They don't eat complete crap all the time, but they buy a lot of cheap, easy food, and they have three portions of something when they should be having one. They don't understand calories, or portion control, or anything like that.

So I have hit my goal weight, with the help of gym and reinventing my diet. I'm slim, but I'm well within the healthy BMI for my height. Now my family have started bursting out the "concern" when I go to visit. I eat normal portions, they eat triple, and they start getting "concerned" when I refuse extra. The fact I no longer eat dessert is a bad sign, the fact I count calories is a bad sign, my sister called me a "twig", my dad asked me if I was "anorexic"... etc.

They simply are deluded as to what a normal, healthy female body looks like (as in, even when I was overweight, my family saw me as normal, and I believed them). 

I just needed to rant I guess, and ask for advice? I told them to knock it off and they just said they were "joking" :I

Tl;dr: I lost weight, large family cannot understand, prone to becoming "concerned" that I refuse dessert, and won't stop making comments, "joking" or otherwise
