Frequently I've seen comments that don't break any of our subs rules, that just state an unpopular opinion, downvoted into oblivion. Is this really the point of the downvote button? Are you respecting their place at the table of discussion by doing this?

If you disagree with someone's opinion don't downvote it, leave it at the measley score of 1. Use your words and respond to their post with why you don't agree. That's how discussion works. At least that's how I see the voting system to operate here. Feel free to comment with what you think.

I'm tired of seeing comments with negative scores when they are respectful commenters just trying to discuss their point of view. That's how you get a hall of echoes.
