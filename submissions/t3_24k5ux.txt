Hi ladies! I'm having trouble deciding what to do about my hormone issues. Ever since I've been on the copper IUD (non-hormonal), I've had consistent fluctuations in my mood. For about 2.5 weeks after my period, I'm very happy and balanced. The week before my period, I'm incredibly moody & irritable... at EVERYONE and EVERYTHING. 

I don't act on the irritability towards anyone but my boyfriend, and it's ruining my relationship with him. I get angry, irrationally jealous, mean and can't control it.

I'm thinking of getting back on a pill, just so regulate my hormones. Does this work for anyone else? Also, for people who don't take contraceptives with hormones, how do you regulate your hormone fluctuations?
