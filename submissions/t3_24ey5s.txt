Waist: 24 inches      
Hips: 40 inches        
Height: 5'5     
I don't know my thigh/leg measurements but [here's](http://i.imgur.com/l6gIRQZ.jpg) the only picture I really have that shows how thin they are.       
       
I'm really needing some job interview clothes..and my entire bottoms wardrobe is leggings/jeggings/sweatpants/skirts. What's crazy is even sometimes leggings/jeggings don't fit right! They'll fit my hips and then be weirdly baggy in the legs, or they'll fit my legs and be paaaainfully tight in the hips... which is why I feel a bit hopeless when looking for big girl pants.     
Worst case scenario I'll wear a dress/skirt, but I'm definitely 10x more confident and comfortable in pants. It'd help to have my appearance as one thing I don't have to worry about during interviews haha.      
       
Ideally they'd be under $50 but honestly I'm willing to suck it up and pay more for just ONE PAIR of professional looking bottoms :( online or in store...I don't care ;-;
