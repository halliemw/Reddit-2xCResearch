Hi everyone! I've been a stepmom for almost 3 years and have 3 children (boy who's 7, girl who's 10, boy who's 11) that I really see as my own. 

I love them to death, but sometimes I don't get the feeling that it's reciprocated, and obviously that hurts. In the beginning I thought it was normal, it was obvious everyone needed some time to adjust, and it did improve over time, but there is still some friction at certain points.

Actually, the two boys are adjusting just fine, but the girl is only partially. 
In the beginning she gave me a really hard time, and the fact that she had an oedipus complex, only made it worse. For the people who don't know this, I put the link below, but it boils down to the fact that she saw me as 'her adversary' in a battle that was going on in her mind for the love of her father. And before people start to question this, this isn't just my opinion, it is the collectif opinion of me, the father, her biological mother, rest of the family etc. and has been professionally diagnosed.

Anyway, quite some time has passed, and it has seeped through to her that it IS possible for her father to love both me and her, but she still really likes to be difficult about the stupidest of things, just for the sake of being difficult to me.

I hope this kind of gives you an image! My questions are
a) How do I react best to this behaviour? and
b) What suggestions do you have to bring our family as a whole tighter together? I've already started doing family nights once a week. That is an evening where we don't turn on the tv and just play boardgames and talk together! :)

I just want the best for my family and really want all three of my stepchildren to feel at their best!

Thanks for reading, any tips are welcome! :)
