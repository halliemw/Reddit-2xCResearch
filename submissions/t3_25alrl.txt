My sister is currently pregnant, very near her due date. I wanted to call her today to wish her happy mother's day (she's not technically yet, or is she? I don't know!) I'm hoping it's just perfect and she has it on mother's day baby today (even if mother's day is on different days each year...)

But the problem is that I had a flash-forward to what I would say as I said goodbye, and in my flash-forward daydream I said goodbye by saying "Good luck." Then she asked "What do you mean, good luck?" And I, caught off guard, responded "You know... that the baby is healthy and you don't die in childbirth or anything..." And then my imaginary sister-in-my-head became upset at bringing that up.

So I don't want to do that. "Have a good time!" seems utterly inappropriate since she's going to be in pretty severe pain what with the childbirth and all...

So what, in TwoX's experience, would be a right/better thing to say? Maybe just "I love you. Talk to you later."?

I feel silly asking this now... so, apologies, I'm excited that I'm about to have a nibling (don't know the gender, and so that's become my favorite word...) and want to talk to my sister but not upset her, and TwoX was the first place I thought to ask.
