My first thought was "what would I like if I were in her place?" But its been so long since I've had a sore throat or been sick that I legitimately can't remember. I thought it might be a good idea to ask what other women like when they're sick, so here I am! What do you like when you're sick with a sore throat?

EDIT: just want to say thanks to all the helpful responses! Turns out she's feeling better today, so I'll have to keep your tips in mind for the next time she's sick!
