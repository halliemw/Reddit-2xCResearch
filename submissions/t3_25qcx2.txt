We've heard a lot about why everybody thinks the defaulting of this sub was a bad decision.   

* On the one hand, we've got the faithful TwoX subscribers who are battling the influx of shitposting and rage-inducing commenters and fear that our little 'safe' space is going to the dogs. 
* On the other hand we've got the MENZ. The ones who are pissed off that their internets are contaminated with with girl germs and instead of unsubscribing, they'd rather tell us how wrong we are to think we deserve a portion of their all important brain space (it is usually quite limited in these specimens, so I can see why they'd want to prioritise it...)
 
While I have zero sympathy for the latter, and a lot of empathy for the former... I still disagree with both. I think making TwoX a default was NEEDED, and I'm glad the mods decided to give it a go. I hope they stay with it for a little bit longer. 
 
My reasoning: reddit needs more diversity on its front page and in its default subreddits if it's ever going to become a less shitty echo-chamber of awfulness. As a woman and a redditor for 7 years or more (on my regular account) I've seen reddit go through a lot of changes. Over the years, I've retreated into fewer and fewer subreddits because of the shitty behaviour and opinions of the masses. There are now maybe five subreddits I visit on a regular basis, twox being one of them. I'm not a particularly fragile flower, so the fact that I feel reddit is basically a hostile, unlikeable space for the most part is probably a good indicator that plenty of others do too - and anecdotally I think we can all agree a lot of women feel that way.  
 
**This general awfulness will never change unless there is more diversity in the defaults.**

Does this mean things are going to be easy? No. It probably means TwoX will go to shit... for a while at least. It probably means the mods are going to have a hell of a job moderating shitposts and shitty comments. It means we, the community, are going to have to put up with some uncomfortable situations - and I by no means think the community has to put up with something that makes them uncomfortable. Sexual harassment or rape threats or anything of that nature is **not acceptable**. For users who have to deal with that (and the fear of it is what's causing me to use this alt today, tbh), I'm not sure what the answer is. I'm not sure what's best. For those who choose to stay and engage in TwoX anyway, we'll have to be strong and vigilant and report bad behaviour to mods and admins.  
 
Default status may even mean - worst case scenario - that TwoX is unsalvageable. But I know that you're not going to make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Hopefully the eventual omelette of a nicer, more equal and tolerant reddit is a delicious omelette worth fighting for (ok, my metaphor ability sucks...)  
 
In the mean time, I'd like to mention that /r/SRSWomen exists - it's a lot like TwoX but men are explicitly forbidden from posting/commenting and some women here might find it a safer space than TwoX until shit dies down here.  
 
**edit:** if there are other women-focused subs that explicitly foster a safe space for women, let me know and I'll list them here too. I realise /r/srswomen might be offputting for some, but I honestly don't know of another sub that strictly enforces a safe space for women...  
 
**edit 2:** Another sub recommendation: /r/FemmeThoughts - for those who don't want to go to SRS
