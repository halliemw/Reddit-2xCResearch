I suffered from periods-from-hell, but my ex-fiance was a wonderful man.  

He knew when I came home from work bent over,  my hands in my pelvic region looking like I was trying to prevent my insides from falling out,  the wild-eyed look of migraine and breaking out in cold sweats that I've just had an awful day.

He would help me undress, get my favorite nightie, prop me up on the sofa, get a hot-water bottle, extra pillows, ibuprophen, glass of cold water, cup of hot tea, the remote control, a big warm blanket, a container with cold water and rag, place food within reach, make sure chocolate was part of that meal, place the phone within reach, bring me the book I was currently reading and whatever magazines were around the house... and then he would leave for a couple of hours.

RIP John, you were a good man.


Anyone else have stories along these lines?
