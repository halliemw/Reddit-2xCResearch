I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts on this. You see, I've been engaged for about four months now and I absolutely love my fiancée. And I know he loves me. 
So We have a mutual friend that he works with twice a week and we all hang out together. 
I will admit that I had been jealous of her in the past but came to the conclusion that I was being silly. I genuinely like her. However, it seems like everything we do has to involve her. My fiancée would never ever cheat on my physically. He's just too good of a guy too. But it used to be me that would walk into a room and he immediately brighten up......but now it seems to be her.
