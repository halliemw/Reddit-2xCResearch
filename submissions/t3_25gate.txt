Hey everyone! I had a mutual breakup with this guy, we'll call him Dave, a little over a month ago after dating for 4 months. We broke up because it was bad timing and I felt like he was pulling away from me. All I wanted to do the day we broke up was tell him I loved him, which I had never said before, but didn't because it would only make things harder.

Fast forward a month and he tells me he wants to talk. So we meet and he tells me that the reason he was pulling away was because of timing (he is a graduating senior in college and I am a junior) but mostly because the relationship he used to be in, which lasted 7 years, was with someone who was not only emotionally abusive but once hit him so hard in the face it fractured his jaw. And so when he started realizing he really cared about me and loved me, it brought all that back and started to scare him so he tried to pull away to feel safe, even though that wasn't what his heart wanted. 
 
So, it is finals week and I am stressing about grades super hard and now I'm hanging out more with Dave and he tells me he loves me but he is leaving in less than two weeks to probably live at home as he is not yet employed. And I enjoy time with him but Im scared that I don't know why I like him, and that maybe I loved him before because I just loved having a boyfriend? I have also been working through depression and anxiety with a therapist and I feel like those things are adding to the negative feelings I have, I just want it to work so badly! I just need more time to work out my feelings but right now I feel like this is doomed or will make me feel trapped. I just wish I could leave everything behind and spend time with him without any stress from school or jobs come in so I can sort out what's right for me. do any of you have experiences like this or advice for me?
