Bit of back story: BOY A and I were together on and off for 6 years.  I moved away and we broke up, but the relationship was floundering anyway.

Shortly afterward, I began a fling, which turned into a relationship months later (when he moved here) with BOY B.

It has been over a year and a half since I left BOY A and I still find myself thinking of him often.  Sometimes even every single day, to the point where I feel like I'm going crazy.

Most days I'm happy with my current relationship, but every once in a while I hear something about my ex and it's back to square one.

My current boyfriend and I are good for each other emotionally, he has some issues that I am able to help him with, and he is great for me as I love a relationship where we have each others backs.  But I find myself missing my ex who had a drive for life, he was always up for a great time and a charmer, had a ton of friends who all loved him.

I feel like I should be past the point of being nostalgic for my previous relationship, since we've been broken up for over a year and a half....I guess I'm just looking to vent, and if anyone has any advice for me I'd greatly appreciate it.
