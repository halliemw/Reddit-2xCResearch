Okay so when I want to watch sports on t.v like basketball it's always NBA and there is no women sports. I never get to watch WNBA and it really bothers me. I go through every channel looking for womens sports but theirs nothing other than volleyball and we all know the reason for that right...all for the butts that bothers me a lot, the only way people would watch womens sports if it involves showing some...skin. The men have all the shoes like LeBronze and Jordan but not for women like Tarausi or Moore. I would love to buy those shoes...just want to vent. 

EDIT: WOW THANKS FOR ALL THE RESPONSES AND ALL THE OTHER SPORTS I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH!
