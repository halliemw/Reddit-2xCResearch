On Monday, I got an IUD put in. It's fine. I'm not experiencing mind-blowing pain or bleeding to death. That's not what this is about. Well, not really. Ok, kind of. I have slight cramps, which the doctor told me to expect. Sometimes slight cramps turn into real cramps and that shit hurts. But I know that eventually it will go away. 

Today I was sitting at my desk and I got the real cramps. And they hurt pretty bad (still do, as I'm writing this). I work in an office that is normally all female, and we tend to just say whatever comes to mind. We have a colleague working here from another branch and he's a dude. No biggie. 

I told my co-worker that "My uterus hurts" and the guy colleague came out of his office and was grinning uncomfortably and motioned that there was an employee in the testing room and obviously that they could probably hear me. I realized that he was uncomfortable because I had said "uterus." And then him being uncomfortable made me uncomfortable. No, not uncomfortable, I take that back--it made me irritated. Why is it alright to say that any other body part hurts but saying the word uterus is taboo? Come on, people! Seriously???

TL;DR: I said "uterus" at work and people got weird about it, as if I had been cussing.
