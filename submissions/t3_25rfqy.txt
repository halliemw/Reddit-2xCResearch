Me and my boyfriend of 4 1/2 years broke up recently. It wasn't necessarily on good terms, and it wasn't necessarily on bad terms either. We've talked since we've broken up to make sure that this was what both of us felt would be best.

The thing is, I don't feel sad. I do get some moments where I want to cry, but the feeling goes away as fast as it came. I'm usually one to holds everything in until I'm by myself (I wouldn't want to be crying at school or work!) but by the time I'm alone, I don't feel like crying anymore. I haven't really talked to anyone either, because I feel like theres nothing to say.

As of lately, my appetite has changed quite a bit. I simply just don't feel hungry anymore. The times I do eat, it's because I know that I can't go throughout my day with an empty stomach. However, every time I *do* eat, I get nauseous because I'm literally forcing myself to eat, or I just don't feel hungry anymore. When I eat, I make sure I'm eating smaller portions, because I don't want to waste food that I know I won't end up eating.

I don't understand why I don't have an appetite, I don't feel sad about the breakup at all so I'm not sure why I don't feel like eating anymore? Is it possible that even though I don't *feel* stressed, my body is still stressing out?

Any tips, advice, suggestions?
