I work for a big tech company where I am the only female tech on hand. Its quite a diverse company cabling, satellite, AV, IT etc. I am a systems technician/ consultant for IT. Anyway the company decided its going to advertise and asked for input on commercial ideas. I told them they need to put a bloke on the reception desk and a girl in a technical role just to show diversity in the company and stay away from stereotypical labels. Well they loved my idea however it turns out they want the real techs in the ad and since I'm the only female tech they want me to be in it. Ahhhh I hate being in front of more than a couple of people and now my face is going to be plastered all over my city.

But of course if I refuse then there will be no female representation in the ad except for the admin girls. Dammit :D
