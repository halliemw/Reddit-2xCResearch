I am admittedly obese, mid-20s, and for the past 7+ years my period has been very off and on - something that started after I got off the pill.  When I do get my period, it is a very heavy flow, sometimes very drawn out (over a week). Sometimes though, I do not see it for months on end. If it's been a while, sex with my partner usually gets it going the next day (gross, sorry). The last time I had an ultrasound down there due to some intense stabby pain on the left side, the technician wasn't able to locate my left ovary?! I don't know if that has anything to do with anything.  I've been really embarrassed to bring it up with anyone, because whatever the problem is it's my fault because I haven't taken better care of my body.  I just don't know what to do. I want to have kids with my husband someday, but what if I can't? If anyone has any experience or advice I would really appreciate it. Thanks.
