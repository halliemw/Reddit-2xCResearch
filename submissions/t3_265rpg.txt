i'm on vacation visiting family in asia for 2 and a half months and i'm 99% sure i have a yeast infection. my symptoms aren't too severe but it's still really uncomfortable. i'm 18 and i've never had anything abnormal go on with my... girly bits before. i'm kind of scared to tell my mum because she's a typically conservative asian parent, i'm not sure how she'll react. also, my boyfriend is coming here next week and i'm afraid she'll link my YI to activities with him? i'm in beijing right now, does anyone know how to get treatments for this kind of thing? i probably should see a doctor first, but i'm pretty convinced it's a YI and nothing else, i just want to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.
