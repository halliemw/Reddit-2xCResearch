Hey XX ,

I snooped on my boyfriends facebook and saw he was talking with his ex. Her ex said she wanted to give him a lap dance. He replied with capital letters and an explimation point stating he would love it. Earlier convos were deleted.

Ive expressed my distrust about her in the past but he refuses to stop talking to her stating they are good friends. To complicate the situation, we both live in my ex's house, but my ex, my bf and me aremutual friends. 

I confronted him and he said she was in vegas taking stripping classes and the convo was him "fucking around" - as in not a serious convo. He stormed off and started walking home, till I picked him up. I feel worthless and unworthy of any ones love and that I am a terrible person.

Please help.
