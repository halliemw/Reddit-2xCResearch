I'm really happy that I found you guys.  I don't really have any close girl friends and thanks to the sub being defaulted...  I actually found all of you.  It feels good knowing there's a community of kind women who have all found a place to... well... talk about womanly things!  I pretty much just lurk, but just reading what you all have to say makes me feel like I'm a part of this community.  I know many of you are upset about all of the trolls leaking into your subreddit... but maybe it will make you all feel better knowing that you've helped at least one person feel connected to a group she really needed to feel connected to.  :)  Thanks, you gals kick ass!
