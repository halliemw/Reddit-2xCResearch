My uncle died just over two weeks ago, but he was just found yesterday, in his residence. I have a large extended family and they're actually really good about checking up on each other, even though we're all spread all over the country. So I don't get it. How could he have died and none of us know? He was pretty youngish still, so it's such a shock and the family is maintaining facebook silence until everyone's been notified so I'm venting here.

He wasn't always a great guy, actually did some terrible stuff several years back, but he cleaned up his act, sobered up and seemed to be on his way to turning his life around. And now he's just-gone. The uncle who gave me my first dog. Who gave me books whenever he saw me when I was younger, who would give me gift cards to barnes and nobles while my other relatives bought me makeup as I got older. The one who, until he got into drugs, was the relative I was compared to the most. 

All over the country, my extended family was celebrating easter just a few days ago. And he was dead and no one knew. I know it's natural to be angry during the grief process, but this doesn't even feel like anger. Just bewilderment. How could he have died and none of us know for two weeks?
