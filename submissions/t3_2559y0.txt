I have no shame left regarding getting intimate; I think it has *all* happened to me.  

* Period starting full-on during foreplay?  Check.

* Leaking breastmilk on my partner during sex?  Check.

* Ending up with a buttcrack full of vaginal secretions and sperm and nothing to wipe with?  Check.

* Digging pubes out of my vagina the morning after?  Ugh. Check.

Let's hear yours!
