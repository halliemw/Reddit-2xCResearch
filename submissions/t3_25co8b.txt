I've been on the pill on and off for about 8 years, and I'm just really sick of it. I originally started using it as a teenager to help clear my skin, and ease period pain. My last pill (Ovranette) was great for the last two years, but a few months ago I developed painful, cystic acne - akin to what I had before I started treatment with accutane. I cut out all my skin products, etc. and reintroduced them to see what was making me break out, until finally I stopped taking my pill. Within a few days my skin was recovering.

The pill for me also isn't a reliable contraceptive, as I have IBS. My SO and I use condoms, but I'd still like to have something that is reliable, and could ease my periods/not disrupt my skin. So far I've thought about an IUD and the coil, and I'm going to the doctor soon to discuss my options. 

So what do you ladies think? How have you fared with other methods? Is there anything else you could recommend that could work for me? Are there side effects to some that doctors brush off as being nothing?
