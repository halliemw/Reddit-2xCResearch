Sorry for the throw away - A lot of people in my life know my actual username. At 10am tomorrow I have an appointment with Planned Parenthood for a surgical abortion. I'm about 8 1/2 weeks along according to the math the woman did when I scheduled my appointment. I have a good book, a ride, comfortable underwear, extra pads... I've read accounts on here from women who have also had it done. I've watched the planned parenthood video about it, I understand how it works. 

To women who've had it done, or those who have had friends in this situation, what do you wish you would have known? I'm honestly a little terrified. I also have a pretty big issue; I can't swallow pills. Like, at all. I've never really been forced to before. I've tried the past couple days to swallow some Advil, so I could get used to it... but I just can't. Is this going to be an issue?? Does anyone know?

Thanks, Two X. This is such a good community, and has helped me so far so much. Any words of advice or wisdom will be so appreciated.
