**OP tl;dr** Last fall, I had a heart-to-heart with my most trusted mentor about what might be holding me back from landing a tenure-track academic position. He gave me two pieces of advice: (1) "Remove all traces of your family status from your CV, webpage, and social networking profiles"; and (2) "replace one of your letter writers".

I wanted to update because I received so many kind PM's and replies to my original post. I was really frustrated and venting to you wonderful ladies (and gents!) was incredibly cathartic and gave me a lot of strength of resolve. 

I am delighted to say that the job search this round was a complete 180 from previous years. I followed my mentor's advice and replaced one of my letter writers and removed all traces of family status. I was invited to 5 interviews at R1 research institutions and received 3 job offers, one of which was from my top choice school. 

In the end, I think that removing my family status helped me, which is a bit annoying, but a reality. I also think replacing the "meh" letter writer helped even more. As one of my mentors said: "*The application gets the department interested, the letter writers land you the interview, and your interview lands you the job*". 

In times where the competition is fierce and there are 100+ applicants for each position, I think that every little thing that can set you apart from other applicants, as to be done. I still received a quite a few rejections this round, BUT I ultimately landed the job I wanted. I am feeling tremendously fortunate and excited and happy.

Now I need to think of creative "thank you!!" presents for mentors and letter writers. Any suggestions?
