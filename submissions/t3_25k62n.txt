I grew up only with my mentally and emotionally abusive alcoholic father. He told me early on that my mother abandoned us (me). In fact, he kidnapped me (after he left me with her) with the help of her brother and my namesake, Uncle Charlie. So from the first I can remember I've believed and trusted the things people have told me on face value only to find that I've been lied to. On one hand I feel skeptical and the other trusting. At the age of 36, how can I gain perspective on life, and understand the motivations of people? How can I tell who to trust and who should be suspect?
