Hello, ladies. I absolutely love this subreddit and all of the support and kindness you all show. I am 22 years old and have been experiencing symptoms of endometriosis (pain during sex, sharp pain before and during my periods, irregular periods, frequent urinary tract infections, etc). My mother has endometriosis and has undergone various surgeries and chemo- induced menopause. So I'm a little worried and want to get myself checked out. I'm not sure what questions to ask when I go to my doctor or what to expect at all. I still have to find a doctor in my area (I just moved) and hope that it won't cost me an arm and a leg without insurance. :(
