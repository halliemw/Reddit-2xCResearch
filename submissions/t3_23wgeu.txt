I've got a lot of emotional issues stemming from physical, emotional and sexual abuse. I have a history of eating disorders and self-harm, in short, I feel like I'm pretty damaged as a person. I also feel like my past has made me a pretty cool person to be around, and I have been doing really well at building myself back up. 


Last night the guy I've been seeing on and off for a year and a half had a bit too much to drink. We had an all-nighter, just talking. He opened up to me, and on one hand, I feel like we needed to discuss all of the things we did. 


On the other hand, he told me that the fact that I was a broken wing really turned him on. I didn't quite understand what he meant, so I asked him about it this morning. He told me to google it. This is what I found.

broken wing-

Most often, someone emotionally scarred, or emotionally damaged beyond the point of repair.

Often used in a derogatory way to describe a girl with a lot of emotional issues.


I feel so disgusting right now. I've been trying not to puke/cry. I feel like all the love i have for him, our entire past together has been a lie. I feel like he was only seeing me for my past. 

Is this a common thing? Am I wrong to feel like this is dehumanizing me?

Tldr-guy calls me a broken wing and I want to cry.

Edit: I'm going to talk to him in a little bit. Im not sure if an update is appropriate. Either way, thank you very much.
