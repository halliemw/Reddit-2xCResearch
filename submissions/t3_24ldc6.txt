We'd been dating for almost a year and a half.  So not very long.  But I am quite attached to him.  And I still love him very much.

What was the problem then?  My not wanting children.  I grew up with two special needs brothers.  One who has Autism.  I sometimes imagine having a child of my own.  But those dreams quickly turn sour from the struggles and pain my parents went through raising two special needs boys.   I suppose, as a defense and coping mechanism, I've decided that instead of pining away at wanting a child but being too scared, it's easier to just decide that I vehemently don't want a child, even though, that's the polar opposite from the truth.  

It's tough to talk about, and I don't have any sort of support system to talk about this to.  So, hurrah for the anonymity of the internet.  I needed to get this out in the open.
