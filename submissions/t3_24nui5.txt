Alrighty,I'm currently in a bit of a disagreement with my man friend. 

I'm very comfortable with my body,I work hard to be small,toned and petite,and I honestly just love being naked. It's not for sexual purposes,I HATE pants,I love being comfortable,and I'm not shy. 

This past week I was studying with a guy friend,who I have ZERO attraction to. We wanted to take a break,so we planned on running over to the gym and getting a workout in. I didn't feel like walking down two flights of stairs to use a female bathroom to change into my gym clothes,so I just stripped down and changed in the guys' dorm room. I didn't think twice about it,and I honestly wasn't trying to be slutty or anything like that. We worked out,got back to studying and didn't think twice about it.

My studying partner is friends with my man friend,and mentioned to him that I was attractive and had a nice body. He mentioned that I changed in front of him,and my man friend was PISSED. He's pissed at me,I'm in trouble,and I'm trying to figure out it i'm wrong. 

So are you comfortable being naked in front of others??
