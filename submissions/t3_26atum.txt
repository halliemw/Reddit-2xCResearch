Let me start by saying I am a very short little white girl, and I'm bragging here cause I'm actually pretty proud of myself. I did something I thought I would never last weekend. I had just landed in NYC and was in a crazy long line for a cab. Unofficial cabbies were trying to scam the people in line taking them out to charge who knows what for a ride into the city, and was particularly harassing this girl behind me with "where you going?", "do you need a cab?", or whatnot. She was just trying to ignore him but he wasn't going away. So I turn around and look up at this giant definitely scary looking guy and said "She said no." He puffed up and said "what was that?" and I looked him dead in the eye and said "She said no."

He was like "oh ok" and moved on. She mouthed "thank you" to me, and I gave her a nod like "yeah girl, I got you."
