I know this sub probably gets a lot of this, but I value a lot of the opinions on here. Thank you all in advance!

I've just recently found out that I'm roughly 7 weeks pregnant. I already have a son who is 15 months old. I can't stop going through the range from excitement to I-fucked-up. I already had to deal with everyone's judgment of me and how irresponsible I am to have had one child, and I know it will be even worse with two. 

Through my first pregnancy and the first couple months after, my long-term boyfriend developed a serious opiate addiction. We separated, he got on Subutex, got a job, and he recently became a part of my son's and my life again. I hope things will work out for him, but the thought of having another baby to raise on my own is not something I want.

I work part-time and started taking classes again. It's a struggle every day trying to find a babysitter for my son. I've looked into daycare, but everywhere I can afford is full. I've tried using family and friends, but everyone gets so stressed by him that they don't answer my calls or make excuses now. Because I live with my parents now, I don't qualify for state-assistance for childcare. My parents have already talked to me about when I am moving out/having my son here is stressful. I would not feel comfortable to stay here with another baby. I also know I would lose their support if I got an abortion.

I went to my first appointment before I realized just how mixed my feelings were. I know 100% that I am in no place to have another baby. I know I could manage, if I wanted to. I guess I just don't know if I am ready for it.

I'm sorry I'm all over the place! I don't have any unbiased people in my life to turn to, so again, thank you all for being there for me.
