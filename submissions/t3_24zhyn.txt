sorry to finally make an account and use this subreddit. I've had a lot of firsts lately....

Basically I'm a father now and the prospect of me being a father to a little girl kind of is exciting and also scary. I never had a sister, or really any girl 'friends' per se. In researching stupid psychology on the internet the whole idea of acting as a man (ie be a dick to your daughter) is generally what a lot of men say to do - especially to their potential boyfriends/friends. That doesn't sound right.

So ladies who have great experiences with your dad please share. Dancing classes, softball, soccer, camping?  And if you didn't have a good dad also please let me why you think that.

I grow from discussion. There's a lot of craptacular books out there I know but the ones I've read just don't speak to me. Plus in so much of my life i've spent winging the details - I don't want to wing/clutch the details of anything related for my daughter.
