Last week I had a Skyla IUD placed (basically the baby sister to the Mirena - less hormones, smaller). I've had two Paragard IUD's, both started to come out so I am hoping that the Skyla is a better fit (literally and figuratively).

However, for the last week I have had cramping every day. It lasts anywhere from 15 minutes to hours. They're very painful (worse than the cramps when it was inserted, though honestly insertion was relatively easy). When I am cramping, I am spotting. I don't notice any blood during the day when I'm not cramping. 

I didn't have this experience after either Paragard insertion. So my questions are these:

*  Do any of you have the Skyla? If so, did you have a similar experience?

* Those of you that had Mirena, did you experience this? I'm wondering if it has something to do with hormonal BC vs. the non-hormonal BC. I haven't had hormonal BC in years.

* If you've experienced this, were there any issues or is it normal?

I am going to contact my doctor if this lasts through the week. I tend to overreact to pain so I thought I'd look for comparable experiences first.
