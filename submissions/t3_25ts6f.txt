TwoX, please console me with your embarrassing poop horror stories... cause today I pooped myself in public. 

I'm almost 30. I haven't peed or pooped myself since elementary school. 

But today I was in Walmart just picking up a few things. I didn't even have a cart. As I was standing there debating if the $1 a piece slotted spoons were actually any better than the $1 pack of three when I felt a little rumble and pressure. I noted that I need a bathroom soon but thought to myself, "I'm just gonna be a few minutes, I can make it home." I decided on the three pack for a dollar. I grabbed them off the hook and took a step to turn around and head an aisle over to grab a new shower mat. But I didn't make it. I was immediately thrown into panic mode. 

I don't even know how it happened so fast but before my left foot had hit the floor my butthole was puckering so hard it clearly felt bad for what it had done. Chunky, slimy, wetness filled up my crack and traveled all the way around to the front. My panties were soaked immediately and I could feel it starting to drip down to my upper thighs. I dropped my dollar utensils and started walking as normally as one can when trying to hide that last nights chicken curry is in their crotch. I realized I was super lucky to be wearing a black dress and not jeans as the slime headed quickly down my legs. I made it to my car, deciding that a public bathroom was not properly equipped to handle this, and grabbed a stack of papers that hadn't made it into the shredder at work for the past two months. A lady in the car adjacent stared at me as I arranged them on my front seat so as not to ruin the breathable leather. 

I drove twenty minutes home, waddled up the drive way, and trashed the now neon yellow papers on the way to a scalding hot shower. 

I still feel unclean. I'm so embarrassed. I'm totally gonna get a yeast infection or UTI aren't I?
