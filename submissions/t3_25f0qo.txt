I may be completely wrong on this and I really hope I am. But I do not believe the new guy I am dating went and got tested even though he said that he did. Backstory: I have been seeing this guy for 3-4 weeks and the condom breaks and neither of us noticed until he was finished. I could immediately tell that there was cum inside me and asked him to check the condom. He told me it was fine but I said that he needed to check again because I could tell. He comes out of the bathroom and tells me it was split when he looked at it. I tell him he needs to get tested and he says he will. 5 days later he went to planned parenthood and got tested. He told me they charged him $160 and would not take his Humana insurance. I find this strange because all of my friends and I have never been charged more than $100 even without insurance. Am I just being paranoid? How can I confront him about this. PP does not give you a paper copy of the results so I can't ask to see that. 
FYI: I am on BC and was STD tested 2 weeks prior to incident. Also I plan on parting ways with this guy once he gets his results. My gut just does not trust him.

Edited: I will be getting tested myself too. I would just like to know his results so that I don't freak out while waiting for the incubation periods to get my tests.

EDIT 2: As previously stated, I plan on breaking up with the guy because I don't trust him.

UPDATE: After 45 minutes of calling, PP answered the phone and informed me that testing IS $160 for new patients. So I feel a lot better knowing he at least told me the correct price. And they will print results if he goes back in and signs a waiver. Now my question is, how do I ask him to go and get me printed results without offending him?? I am not worried about losing the guy, but I would like to have proof before/instead of him getting pissed off and ignoring my request.
