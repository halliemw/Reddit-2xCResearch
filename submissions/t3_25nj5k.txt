So, I'm preparing to go party the weekend away at a campground on the lake for two of my good friends birthday. Inevitably, this one chick that I really don't like got invited and is coming. I don't really have a reason to dislike her other than every time I have hung out with her in my group of friends she barely gives me the time of day or just interacts with me very superficially, and the next time I see her she acts like it's the first time she's met me(we have partied together countless times by now and have "known" each other for years at to this point). She annoys the shit out of me and I feel obligated to pretend to like her and I'm always polite but I'd rather just ignore her. 
Do any of you ladies have "friends" like this? How do you deal?
