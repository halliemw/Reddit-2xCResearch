Ladies, how did you find your hair stylist? It seems like every time I go for a haircut, and I ask for something soft, feminine, and classic, that translates to asymmetrical 90s mom half-mullet. I say Grace Kelly, I get Kate Gosselin. I ask for a trim and they bust out the razor. The first time I got bangs with long hair, I was told no because it'd be too heavy. (It wound up looking amazing). I had a stylist growing up who bullied me into getting highlights and layers because she hated that I wouldn't let her do anything to my hair other than trim it. It feels like every time I go, they just know how to cut what's trendy rather than what looks good on me. What's the best way to find the right fit? I do not want to be stuck with this shaggy mess until it grows out. [edit] When it was longer, I'd cut it myself, but since I got stuck with this asymmetrical razor nightmare, I have no idea where my layers begin or end and I'm not sure where to start.
