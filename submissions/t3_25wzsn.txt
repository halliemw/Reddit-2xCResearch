Hey lovely TwoXers. I don't know if I want advice, reassurance, or just to rant, but here I am. I am 23f, he is 24m. 

I need to make some big life decisions. I am about to finish my honours year, and I need to decide whether to do a masters and if so, where. I can't do it where I currently am so I will likely have to go overseas. Trouble is, my SO of 4 1/2 years is making this decision much harder. 

The truth is, we have has lots of issues in our relationship, and while we love each other, I don't know if we will last the distance. As we have gotten older, I have realised just how different we are. And I don't know if this will be a good or bad thing in the long run. When I think about being without him, I hate it. But when I think about us being together forever, I'm not so excited either (although I used to be). 

It's just really cutting me up. I know I need to go and do my masters, but it will involve us breaking up. Which kills me inside. I am just so confused. My logical brain and my emotional brain are constantly conflicted. 


The hardest thing is he is going through lots of difficult stuff right now. He doesn't have a direction in life, due to some medical issues he has had/ is having. So part of me wants to cut and run because we are at totally different phases, and the other part of me wants to stay and help him because I feel I owe it to him. 

I don't know what to do. 

Tl;DR: have to decide whether to go overseas for post-grad - if I do, I don't know what to do about my long-term bf who I love but who may not be right for me.
