Rightio Serious question here and yes this is a throw away. I would love to know if men are allowed to post and take part in the feminine discussions. Usually when a guy posts an opinion or experience that can relate or help make light of a situation from the opposite genders point of view, they are shot down for various reasons. 

A typical post by many of the proclaimed females of the sub usually contains a lot of comments that we are unwelcome or that our advice/opinions/experience are invalid.

People I know this might fire up some nasty comments and even exacerbate the situation I am trying to have clarified and I am apologetic for any insensitive comments that may occur.

Explain please do. I'd just love to know because I feel things like this should be clarified.
