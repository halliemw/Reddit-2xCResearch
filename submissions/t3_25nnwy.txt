Is there a certain name for this procedure?  Do I have to find a specialty waxer to do my naughtiest bits?  I'm totally lost!

Edit:  I should have mentioned that I want to keep the hair on my mons, but I prefer for everything on the bits themselves to be gone, and I struggle to shave my butt and then it's super itchy.  No, thanks.
