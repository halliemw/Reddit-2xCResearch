I decided to jump on the menstrual cup wagon and ordered my first diva cup on amazon a couple weeks ago. My period is due at any time now, but it is pretty irregular so even though I keep track of it, I don't really know when to expect it. 

The problem is that I work 12 hour shifts (RN) and often I don't have a lot of time to go to the bathroom if I start feeling something going on. I usually put a tampon in before work just in case I start while I'm busy and pull it out when I get home if I haven't needed to change it before then. Can I do the same thing with the diva cup or will it be uncomfortable?
