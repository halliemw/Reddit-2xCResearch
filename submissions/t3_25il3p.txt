I'm in college and still covered by the health insurance from my father's work. I had a bit of a scare recently with a broken condom, so I've been thinking about adding some other form of BC, preferably an IUD or at least the pill. My father, though, would have a fit if he found out I had a need for BC, and that's not something I want to deal with right now. Do any of you have experience with this kind of situation?  Will he find out if the insurance is billed for a gyno visit or insertion or prescription? Is there any way to prevent this if that is the case? I really appreciate any guidance.

tl;dr: Will my parent automatically find out if I have their work's insurance pay for my BC?
