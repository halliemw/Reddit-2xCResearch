Hi! So recently my period should have started- I got the weight gain, the cramps, the boob tenderness, the whole package. I started preparing for it, but nothing happened.  Edit: I generally have abnormal periods, so I rely on symptoms to prepare.

Now everything is back to normal. I did have PIV sex but there was no ending and he had a condom on, so I don't think I'm pregnant, especially since it was only a few days ago. 

So my question is has this happened to anyone else? Anyone have any idea what happened? Should I get a pregnancy test just in case?

Thanks!
