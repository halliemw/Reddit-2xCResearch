And it hurt. More than I expected and for longer than I expected. I'm not sure how long we tried but eventually me and him gave up after the pain and once I saw all the blood....



I just needed to tell someone...

Edit: I had to stop before he came. He says he's not mad at me and that its perfectly fine and to make sure I'm okay. But I still feel awful....
