Hey TwoX, throwaway here. I recently went off of birth control, Ortho Tri-cyclen Lo, about two weeks ago. To be honest, it's not going well at all and was wondering if anyone had experienced the same (essentially to tell me I'm not going batshit insane).

I stopped taking it due to insatiable hunger and some intense mood swings. The hunger stopped but now I feel so weird. Some new symptoms are:

1. My fingers and toes feel like they're on fire.

2. Not hungry at all. I get jittery if I don't eat but no actual hunger pangs. 

3. The worse one, crazy mood swings. I recently got back from school and I thought the reason for the dramatic changes in my mood were because of finals stress. It's not. I just ended up screaming at my poor parents for asking me to stop being snarky. I told my mom she must hate me and told my dad he was freaking out because of his PTSD (touchy subject). I ended up running to my room and hyperventilating in my closet. 

Before I started taking birth control I was a stoic, calm, person who never cried and who was joking referred to as cold by friends/family because I didn't let stuff faze me. Now I feel like all my emotions have been magnified by 1000 and if I'm not overly happy, I'm sobbing or pissed off. 

There is no chance at all that I'm pregnant. If anyone experienced the same I'd love to hear that I'm not crazy and this will go away soon.
