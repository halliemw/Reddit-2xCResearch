Growing up in the US, I feel like we're taught bra worship. Always wear the bra. It's modest. But don't let your bra be seen.

But just about all my friends complain about bras. I never liked them. Being a transwoman, I only started wearing them about five years ago to give the appearance of having boobs (I now have about a B--if not an A still). I always had a horrible expierence trying to find bras in my size, because according to society 38A doesn't exist.

I've since moved to Europe, and one of my colleagues never wears a bra (she's probably a C cup). And I always find them a hassle, so I tried today forgoing the bra.  And I have to say I love it. Of course I look a little flatter, but I like the feeling.

And after talking to some friends, one doesn't wear a bra either, though she's pretty small like me, and my sister told me to go home right now and put on a bra.

So what do you ladies think? Do you often wear a bra? Have you already gotten rid of them?
