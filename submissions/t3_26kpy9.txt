I have a coworker that I must split weekend shifts with. We are the only two people that are trained for our position. All weekend days need to be covered every month for our position. This other person insists that they cannot work any Saturdays because of their other job and can only work the Sundays. However, I accepted the job assuming that the other person would be able to switch Saturdays on and off, as that is the most reasonable/fair way to split it to me. How can I reason with this person? I want to avoid bothering our manager any further over this situation, but feel that I would have to resort to that if this person does not budge. However, the manager has already told us twice to work this schedule out between us.
