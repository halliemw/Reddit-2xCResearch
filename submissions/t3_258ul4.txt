I'm taking a required health class in my school  and I'm fairly distraught. I know I'm only sixteen, but I feel strongly about this. 

We've had three guest speakers come in to class so far this semester. Every single one of them preached the same thing, abstinence. We have never once gone over birth control or safe sex with our teachers or speakers in my high school career. This most recent speaker irked me the most. 

She told us that if a teenage girl has sex, that she will probably get cervical cancer. Most of them do, according to her. Condoms aren't effective, and they don't protect anyone from STDs or pregnancy at all. (I understand that they're not 100% effective, and nothing really is. But they're not useless.) They "trick" you into thinking you're safe. She didn't acknowledge oral BC or any other contraceptives. 

According to her, people that have sex before marriage are generally "users and losers." Essentially, if premarital sex makes you a bad person. If you marry a non-virgin, they will likely have an STD, which can (and likely will) kill you and your baby you'll be popping out soon. 

Having sex with more than one person makes you unable to love somebody. You lose the ability to love someone. It's compared to duct tape, you "lose your adhesive." She ripped duct tape off of a student's arm to demonstrate. 

I called her out on the premarital sex making you a loser, and pointed out that I had no plans of marriage. She got really upset and started yelling, most of it directed at another kid that asked a question and I. She said she was just helping us not ruin our lives. 

I'm very frustrated with how everything was handled. At the end of the presentation, she reassured us that this wasn't a scare tactic; everything said was true. 

EDIT: Sorry if I seemed condescending, guys! I wasn't trying to be.
