I've been invited to go to lunch with the receptionists and office administrator at work tomorrow. I don't know if it's because I'm a female and all the other females in my office do admin jobs and they don't want to exclude me or because they actually think a graphic designer is admin work. Being an administrative professional is a great job, it's just not what I do.

Obviously I'm not going to turn down the invite, they'd be offended and it's good to get a free lunch, but at the same time I want to at least hint that I'm not actually an administrative professional. I design and layout a monthly magazine our company publishes, and any other in-house design work our company needs. Maybe they're just trying to be nice, but the woman here can be quite catty and haven't shown me much respect in the past.

Maybe I'm over thinking it? Should I go and keep my mouth shut? Should I say how happy I was to be invited despite not being an admin worker?
