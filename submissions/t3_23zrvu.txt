Hi Ladies..

I had a terrible day at work.  I worked 8-6 with no lunch, and someone who I supervise had to be terminated.  I can't give any details, but this individual was one of my favorite people at work.  I'm feeling really bummed.  It had to happen, I'm not disputing that, but it just made for a really crappy day.

Does anyone have links/songs/ideas for a quick cheer me up?  There's nothing that can be changed with the situation, just with my mood and stress level.
