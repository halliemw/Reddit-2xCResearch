Does anyone know of supplements that help with bladder spasms? I really don't want to take meds. I've heard of cranberry supplements, but just wondered if anyone else had heard about anything else.

My urethra gets super sore because it rubs when I have sex despite lube and everything else. Wondered if some supplements might help.
