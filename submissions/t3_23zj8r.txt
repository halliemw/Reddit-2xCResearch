I am at my wits end here... It all started out as verbal abuse, but then escalated in physical abuse. He was insanely manipulative and he blamed me for absolutely everything, even after his own roommate called the cops on him because he could HEAR him hurting me... But whatever, that was 6 months ago, and I got out and am in a much better place. 

The only problem I have is that he will NOT stop posting things about me on reddit. It's been six months and we frequent a lot of the same subs and I have read some of the most terrible things I have ever heard about myself. I don't know what to do rather than just stop coming to reddit.  It's to the point where it doesn't even hurt anymore, but it just sucks because he is a lying sack of shit and he is getting away with all of it. I Already lost all of our mutual friends because he told them I was crazy and that I was abusing him ( even though I have a police report that says otherwise) but he is constantly calling me crazy, a bitch, emotionally immature, emotionally unstable ( which I was near the end because I was terrified of him!!) he called me needy because I used to tell him I missed him while he was at work.. I mean everything that he has ever posted has been a complete load of crap! It's been 6 months!! I just want him to get over me and get over himself and just stop! Me and him have absolutely no contact in the outside world and I just hate that I can recognize his reddit user name. 

I don't know where else to turn and I don't know what to do. I have ignored it for months and I just hate looking through posts and reading all these terrible things about myself. Has anyone else ever dealt with this??? 


EDIT/UPDATE- I have RES installed on my browser now and I scrolled over his user name and there was an "ignore" option. Hopefully that does something, like hide all of his stupid comments from my view. Thanks to everyone who offered kind words, advice and helped me get this figured out! Hopefully this works!
