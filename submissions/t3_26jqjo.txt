A here. I'm a fairly attractive 21 year old heterosexual female. I have an easier time befriending men than women. Lately, I've made male friends using OkCupid or Reddit. But problems arise if/when the guy find me attractive and expects things from me because of his attraction to me.

I'd love to make new female friends because I feel like this wouldn't be an issue with them. I also love girly things like shopping and gossip and sharing our lives, but...

I feel like my weirdness gets in the way. I was diagnosed on the spectrum a decade ago and that often plays a bigger role than I'd like it to. While I've worked hard and come a long way - most of my boyfriends/friends said they would never have guessed when I tell them. But little things have happened at work (see below).

I work full-time right now, so I'm trying to be friendly with people at work. But they have a life outside work and I'm not really sure about mine. I want to hang out and have conversations, but I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing/things.

What should I talk about? What should I say/do? How friendly is too friendly? Should I work on my listening skills?

Right now, I try to say hello and ask how my co-workers are. If I've heard a story from them, I'll ask for updates about it. I'll give tips to avoid getting people in trouble (i.e. you should put your coat on, the boss will say your shirt is inappropriate) or ask them for their phone number so I can contact them if need be (and vice versa).

Other people seem to have it easy and I'd really like it to be easier for me too. I'm willing to work hard and make the changes necessary to be a more likable person. Any advice or stories would be appreciated!

**TL;DR: I make male friends but their attraction to me creates conflict. Would like to make female friends to avoid this issue, but unsure how and what the best method would be. Trying at work, not sure how to improve. So far strategy is being very polite.**

**Any tips on what not to do would also be appreciated. Nothing is too dumb, seriously.**

Little things:
-tried to help a co-worker interact with guests - I could tell by her body language she was uncomfortable - rushed over and interrupted her mid-sentence. humiliated her instead.
-when I space out, I position myself in comfortable "spots" - even when there's someone else there!
-fear of approaching teenagers at work - and often many people - without support: in the form of a co-worker's presence or open nagging.
