I personally feel this was a bad move, and there was no discussion before it happened. Downvote brigrading has already started. How can anyone feel comfortable posting about personal topics here now?

This sub has been a network of comfort and support, not just for women! Defaulting exposes us, heavily, to the cruel and worthless ones, who make their entertainment at the expense of others.

Am I alone in this? What can be done?

Edit: subs like redpill are already preparing themselves for our "indoctrinating" feminism! Hooray!

Edit again! Thank you (everyone!) for your replies to this thread. There have been some valid discussions, and circular ones. Maybe we really can pull through! I must go to bed, 20 hours awake, and been at this for 9. Good night!
