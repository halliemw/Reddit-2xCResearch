Hi! I live in Belgium and came across the Diva Cup online. A few months later I came across a little shop here that sells it and bought one. the lovely salesperson explained it all. I read the manual fifteen times.

I just got my period and I got the damn thing in easily enough, which was a surprise. However, i'm unsure if I did it right, haha. 

I folded it in the C-shape and got it in, but I can't turn it. there's still a bit of C-shape left while it's in. so i'm not sure it's 'sealed'? i heard a 'fwomp' sound. I've done this trice now, after two-ish hours, taking it out (I'm home right now, haha) and putting it back in. 

Taking it out is proving weirdly difficult, since the cup seems to.. err.. migrate up? it's still in straight and doesn't leak (the outside looks clean and there is stuff inside) but it's very far up, so it's hard to grasp it and take it out.

am I doing it right? it'll get easier with practice I'm sure and i don't feel it in there, but I'm afraid that if i leave it in for, say, six hour, it'll migrate further and i won't be able to get it out! 

advice very welcome, ty.
