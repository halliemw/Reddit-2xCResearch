Well I'm 18 and my boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months. We haven't done anything physical because we're both over-thinkers lol. Anyways, we're both very open about everything and we've discussed sex and birth control. He's kind of paranoid and doesn't want to do ANYTHING unless I'm on birth control. I understand but I have no idea how to even ask my mom about getting it. I'm under her insurance so she would have to know. We aren't close and she doesn't like the idea of me having a boyfriend, so in her mind, asking for bc = having sex all the time. I just don't know how to get birth control without my mom flipping shit. Do you guys know how to approach the subject? Am I overthinking it? Any tips are welcome... thanks :)
