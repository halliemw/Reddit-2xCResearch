Dear mods: After posting an innocuous response to an innocuous thread, I immediately got multiple horrible PMs. This subreddit is no longer a safe place, and I hope you feel some of the responsibility for making such a friendly space so dark. The blame is squarely on the disgusting trolls, but your choice to force the people who loved your subreddit to endure the onslaught is really sad.
