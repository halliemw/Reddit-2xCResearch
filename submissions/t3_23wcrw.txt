I'm only 22 but recently I've noticed two lines appearing on my forehead. I know that one day I'll inevitably get wrinkles and I don't dread the fact, however I am a little freaked out about that becoming a reality all too soon. 

So I'm wondering what I can do to help prevent or slow the process. I know I should wear SPF on my face all the time and I'm working on making it a habit to reapply throughout the day. I've just recently started working out, eating healthier, and taking vitamins so that should help too. I also wash my face and apply moisturizer each night.

Any particular foods I should be eating? Creams or anything I should be adding to my skincare routine? Any really weird wives-tales that you have tried or heard work?
