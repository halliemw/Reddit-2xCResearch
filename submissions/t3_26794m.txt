I work with two sisters.

One of these women was already employed for a few years and when an opening came about she recommended her sister.

Her sister (Sister2)is hired, and it seems to be okay, despite them always chit chatting, not doing their work, or me having to reminder sister2 to get back to work or finish doing x, and y.

Now, both are pregnant. Both spend most of their day looking at baby clothes, furniture etc. 

Aside from this sister2 has been taking off. It directly affects my job, since she is suppose to help me with bulk of paper works company BS one human can't do on their own, at least not in a timely fashion. We all work for a small sales company so, legally we are not entitled for days off, maternity leave etc.

So after Sister 2 starts taking off more and more days, my supervisor brings in a new hire for per diem work. Sister 1 sees this, and is fuming. She's giving me attitude, she's not being helpful, she's being rude and even made a comment to me and my supervisor about US NOT FINISHING OUR WORK, while we were sitting and discussing business! Sorry we weren't looking through baby names on google, or at onesies...

They also constantly complain about not having enough money-meanwhile they sit and discuss all the social programs they are eligible for while coming into work with Gucci handbags, Burberry rainboots, just newly released Tory Burch bag, ordering sushi, popping into Sephora during lunch etc. Some clients have felt so sorry for the new mothers to be that they gave them cash gifts! 

My job, which I had formerly enjoyed is slowly becoming a nightmare, and I hate to say this, but I now understand why people avoid working with relatives and pregnant women...

Am I wrong to be pissed? Am I wrong to think Sister1 should be replaced by an employee who can show up to work?
