I am currently in a PhD program and have been having some doubts about whether or not it is actually what I want to do with my life. I still have about three years to go, which seems like a very long time to commit to something I'm not sure about.

For anyone in my situation, do you ever second guess your decision? Is that normal and just part of the ups and downs of research? Any thoughts or perspective would help!!
