People usually make these posts looking for specific answers. But I know there aren't any specific answers to help me. At least not any that I wouldn't just shoot down or ignore the advice because I didn't want to hear it.

My boyfriend and I are extremely dysfunctional as he struggles a lot with depression and I have pretty bad anxiety issues. Certain days he tells me he "just wants to cease to exist" and ignores me. When this happens, I go into full blown panic mode. Crying, hyperventilating, texting him, calling him, just being completely psycho. I feel like it's all my fault that he's depressed and worry that he's going to break up with me. I basically make his problems about me which I know isn't helping him.

I'm trying to hard to give him his space. But I still have these horrible feelings of rejection and betrayal because he doesn't want to see me. I don't really have friends I can talk to about this because I've exhausted them of everything they can possibly say. 

I know I sound crazy. 

TL;DR What do I do when I'm freaking out over my dysfunctional relationship and don't have anyone to talk to? How can I calm myself down? Am I crazy?
