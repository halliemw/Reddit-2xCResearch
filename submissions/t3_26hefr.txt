Okay so I have a boyfriend and I know I love him. Most definitely I have an emotional and romantic attraction to him. And I do think he is physically attractive. But I don't think I have a sex drive or at the very least not a strong one. I love cuddling and kissing and he makes me feel happy. He's never pressured me so don't worry about that...

Here's the confusing part: 
I do have things that like turn me on. And I enjoy that.. But then it's like after a certain point it's like I'm not interested anymore. Think of like a a timed light. You can physically turn it on yourself, but after a while it turns off by itself without anything you've done. Does that make sense?

And the reason why I think I might simply be scared is that I was raped when I was younger and then taken advantage of just a few years ago. 

Am I just too scared of that or am I asexual or on that spectrum?
