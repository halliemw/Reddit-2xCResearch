I just have to share because I'm both terrified and beyond ecstatic. An airline gave me a call about a flight attendant position I applied for. 

After struggling for years with health issues and being unable to work, and then the inability to get calls back because gaps in employment history looks bad, but they called me back! I love customer service, I love travel, and I all around love people. I know they get so many applicants and I may not even stand a chance at the job, buy my gosh they called me back! I answered some basic questions about how I'd handle some situations with people. After all that jazz they said they'd like to schedule a phone interview with a senior rep. I have no idea what to expect or if I'll sound stupid but my gosh I'm stoked. I apologize for the poor grammar I'm just giddy. I could just squeal.

TL;DR Keep on applying places it's not an endless pit of despair.
