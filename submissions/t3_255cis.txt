I read an article somewhere that put forth one reason why women do not receive as many raises as men, or do not receive as much. It's that when a man describes why he deserves a raise, he uses "I" statements.

"I brought in 20% more revenue in Q2."

"I saved the company $2K in overhead."

A woman will typically use "we" statements, or any way to remove herself from the statement specifically.

"My team brought in 20$ more revenue in Q2."

"Our new procedure reduced overhead by $2k."

And let's say the boss is not even subconsciously a little sexist. He hears these statements and thinks "Why should I give HER a raise if it takes a team to do it?"

Then I read this [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/)

So where do I come in?

I work in PR for a small-ish company. I'm tasked with reaching out to blogs to promote our products. I got a blog to publish a post about something we produce and I showed it to my boss. He then congratulated me, told me to copy the link and send it to a few people in the department that made the item. He told me to say "Look what I did!"

I spent five minutes writing and rewriting the sentence. One sentence.

Look what I did!

Look what we got!

Look what I did!

I finally sent the email with "Look what I did!" and I felt sick. I didn't want people in my office to think I was being showy or arrogant. 

Then I remembered to "Mind the Gap" if you will. If I'm not proud of my accomplishments, no one else will be (in the office setting I mean). Has anyone else had a moment where they did not "Mind the Gap"?
