1) For the Married Women (incl. Transgender):

* Is it a common thing nowadays for you ladies to **not** wear a wedding ring?

2) For you Unmarried Women (incl. Transgender):

* Do you use the "I'm married" excuse, even if you're not wearing a ring, when you wish to divert the attentions of someone who expresses interest in you; but, whom you have no feelings of attraction for?  I realize you wouldn't use the excuse if it is someone who is familiar with you; but, say in a "night-out" situation, or a public approach by someone at a bookstore, or some other venue.

Yes, this happened to me once several years ago, so I'm curious.  And, I read a story today of helpful suggestions of how to divert unwanted come-ons when in public.  So, I thought you all in TwoX would be the ones to ask.
