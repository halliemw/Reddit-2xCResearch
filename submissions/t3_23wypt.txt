Hey ladies, I went off hormonal birth control this past October and went straight to using a Cup. While I love the cup, I have noticed my period is super short, like only 2 days of heavy flow and then a few on either end of spotting. Is this normal?? I have spent most of my adult life on some form of birth control, but I never remember my period being this short. I'm 35, so I have now spent the last 2 hours online looking up early menopause and freaking out...it's too late to call the doctor for tests, so, so please, make me feel better and tell me about how your period has changed, etc.
