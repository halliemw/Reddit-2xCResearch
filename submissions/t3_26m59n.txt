**UPDATE!** Thanks to all that helped! Spoke to the roomie when she came home, stayed calm, emphasized that I liked said gf, liked roomie, no desire to see either leave, however living situation needed to be reevaluated. We both talked it out. Due to it being the end of the month, we both feel its fair (and the roomie wants another month to figure out relationship) and if all is good said girlfriend will be offered place on lease next month providing she passes credit check etc... and given roommate agreement  - with rent agreement and utilities worked out. 

I feel like she's moved her girlfriend into the house without really discussing it with me. The girlfriend spends every night over here. She's got her own key. She comes in of her own volition. She stays when the roommate leaves. I like the girlfriend, but I didn't agree to a third roommate and now I feel like it's a done deal and anything I say is going to sound like jealously or some sort of sour grapes or something and I'm going to be a giant bitch.

So to sum up - I think my roomie moved her girlfriend in without really discussing it and I'm a friggin' doormat.
