I'm a gynecologist specializing in family planning, and whenever I think I've heard it all, one of my patients will prove to me again that I have a lot to learn!  

There's no one best birth control for every woman.  I don't make it my practice to tell women what to do - generally as a physician, and specifically with regard to contraception.   It's unfortunate when I see a patient not getting the care she needs and deserves based on fear and misinformation.

I volunteer for bedsider.org to try to address some of the most popular/persistent myths, but I'm sure there's some we're missing.  Help me out!
