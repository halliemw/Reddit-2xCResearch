What can I do in this situation? I'm terrified for her. They were arguing in their basement and he beat her to the ground, grinding his knee into her neck. She took picture evidence of the bruises and showed me in person so there's definitely enough documentation for a report. But she's refusing because she "doesn't want to make a scene."

Apparently he's claiming it was all alcohol and he'll never drink again. Grovelling. Having grown up around physically abusive alcoholics I know that this is an extremely dangerous situation for her. Promises do not mean recovery.

The guy only has a job through her mother (he's an illegal immigrant, so not many options for work) and I'm tempted to drive over and speak with my friend's family one evening regardless of her request for discretion. I think everyone who associates with this abuser should know what he really is. I'm also tempted to call the police over to her house while I'm there-- she might be more likely to file a report if they're present.

Advice? Is there anything I can do to help show her she's making a deadly mistake?
