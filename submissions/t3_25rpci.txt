I am almost 33. I want children. I think I might be pregnant now, but it's not really an ideal situation. My period isn't late, (I am due in maybe a week) but I had (unwisely) unprotected sex around the time I was likely ovulating. My tits are out of control heavy/full, and my body has felt different since when I might have conceived. 

There is a lot more I want to do with my life. I am fairly traditional, at least in some ways. I want to be married when I have children. But I also want to see more of the world. I am in a foreign country now, and the man who would be the father is much younger than me, and not in a great economic situation. But I also want babies, and I am getting older. I guess right now I am trying to decide whether I want a baby or do I want more of my single, selfish life? It's a hard decision.
