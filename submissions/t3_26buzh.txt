So, I have an awesome new boyfriend and my thoughts of him have been creeping into my dreams... This morning I woke up and realised that I'd been kissing my pillow in my sleep! Before I fully woke up, I caught myself in the act of giving the pillow a little peck. I now feel a little silly and have drool on my pillow! Anyone else done something like this?!

Edit: and my first creepy pm. I feel like a true redditor!! Just thought sharing might make you guys chuckle
