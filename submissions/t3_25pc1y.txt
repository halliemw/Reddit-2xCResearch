it was completely infuriating. I really feel the need to post a response on it but was too angry to think of a coherent, well-rounded way to address the issue (namely victim blaming and minimizing sexual harassment). I really want to generate a discussion about some of mentalities seen on this comment thread and why those mentalities are harmful and just plain wrong.

What I wanted to say was something along the lines of "**Jesus fucking christ,** what the fuck is wrong with you people????" But, as you can see, that's about as far along as I can get without seeing red. So, I need responses that will hopefully let these guys know just how wrong their mentalities are and why those mentalities are dangerous. 

[Here is the news article on the sexual harassment case](http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_25770432/serra-high-lawsuit-catholic-school-boys-competed-up), (please read) and [here is the comment thread that followed](http://imgur.com/a/bffv5). As you can see, some comments are "inside jokes", ignore those, the main ones I have issues with should be obvious. 

Thank you in advance for your help! I hope this post isn't too strange...
