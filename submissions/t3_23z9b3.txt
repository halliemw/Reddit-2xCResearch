[Then and now](http://imgur.com/a/atJTY)

Considering my inability to keep plants/fish alive, and my then-dislike for cats, I figured ever owning a cat was totally out of a question, until my boyfriend and I fell in love with and adopted a 3-week old motherless kitten. It was definitely a crash-course in parenting a kitten for both of us, but a year later, she's happy, healthy and well-adjusted!

Thought I'd share, because well, I'm a bit proud :)

Edit: Forgot to add, her name's Freya!
