I was trying to pretend it hasn't been bothering me, but I think about it all the time. For the record I am only 5' 4" and 150 pounds. Over the past three years I have gone from underweight (119/120) to about average (150).


I hate it. I honest to goodness can barely stand to look in the mirror at my angry red stretch marks. I haven't felt this terrible since my ex commented on my weight by telling me I was "Beautiful, but not as beautiful as I used to be." It really wrecked me, because I have spent my whole life listening to my mom complain about her weight, and my dad make comments about both of my siblings weights and eating habits. After some holiday dinner with my family and my SO my dad makes some kind of comment about how we're both 'getting chunky'. This was after my SO left so it was clear he wanted to say something but only after my SO left. I was, and still am, angry at him for even mentioning it.


Between my parents and constantly comparing myself to everyone around me I am getting increased feelings of depression and my fear of failure has my anxiety out the roof. I can barely stand to be naked in front of my SO without wanting to cry or want to crawl out of my skin. I know I'm not alone in these feelings and I just really need some help in conquering them and getting myself to look the way I want to look. 



tl;dr: I'm feeling fat, insecure, anxious and depressed because my dad noticed I was gaining weight and called me chunky. Help me regain some confidence, please. Fitness tips would be great too.
