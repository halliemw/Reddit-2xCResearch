To make a long story as short as possible, I was raised in a very strictly christian home where I wore head coverings, dresses and was taught that women are subservient to men. My job was to get married and have babies, and that was what "god" wanted from me. At the same time, my mother, who had many issues of her own, would often mock girls on tv for being vapid and slutty and generally put down other females for being bad people. 


When I began to go through puberty I rejected all of this as violently as possible and became an atheist, the biggest emo tomboy there ever was and decided I was lesbian. I was under the impression that the only way any boy would think I had value was if I acted masculine. I myself thought that I only had value if I were masculine. 


I'm much better with accepting the feminine side of myself now, and I'm starting to accept that I don't have to be tough in order to be a worth while human being. That being said, the only females I interacted with were in highschool. I have no idea how to make female friends, and how to not view woman as my enemies and competitors. I want to get rid of this negative way of thinking but I don't know how to interact with woman at all. Does anyone have similar experiences or advice they could share to help?
