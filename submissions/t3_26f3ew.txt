I was wondering if anyone could help me with this.

I don't have many close friends. I have trouble maintaining deep and meaningful friendships. During orientation for school, its great because there is always something to talk about. Where are you from? Why are you here? etc.

However, I notice after the second day, those questions have been done to death and I have nothing left to say. Slowly, no one wants to talk to me anymore. They even avoid sitting next to me. 

I have nothing to say sometimes and I feel like I have no sense of humour. I can't make people laugh and I don't laugh much myself (unless with family).

I feel even my boyfriend gets bored with me, as he never wants to spend much time doing anything else other than "physical activities". I feel like a shell with no personality. 

How do I learn to banter and have fun conversations? On another note, how can I converse with someone to know them more intimately?

If this isn't the right place to post this, can someone direct me elsewhere?
