I contracted HSV1 (Herpes - cold sore variety) just over a year ago,, it took nine months and seven agonising and terrible outbreaks for me to be diagnosed properly.

I just completed four months of prophylactic aciclovir - it was lovely, four months of feeling confident and secure and smiling, a week after I have finished, its back. I'm in agony and I'm exhausted and dreading the summer months already.

Other people who have the same issue, what are your hacks? What treatments/vitamins whatever, have made the occurrences lessen, and made them shorter.

The only suggestion I've had so far is using saltwater to dry it out seems to make it go quicker...

Many thanks
