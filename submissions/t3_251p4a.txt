Hey, ladies and many-more-gents-than-previously.

Maybe this is redundant to make this post, but the other major default discussion thread here contains mostly anxious comments. So I thought I'd put up an alternative point of view.

A lot of the complaints going around are that this subreddit was a safe haven prior to it becoming a more "publicly accessible" default. It was a place for women (and men) to speak candidly about certain aspects of their lives. Now, the fear is that this outlet and culture is either bastardized or gone. Potentially vulnerable or sensitive discourse will be open to a wider, more unfamiliar audience than intended.

Well, perhaps the change is a necessary sacrifice. 

reddit has been [called "anti women" before](http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2012/07/why-reddit-so-anti-women-epic-reddit-thread-counts-ways/55080/). I think there's some truth to that. With the addition of /r/twoxchromosomes to the defaults, obviously the admins wanted to change the general perception of the site. They want to say that reddit welcomes women. Prior to this, there were no predominately female driven defaults. /r/aww perhaps came the closest, and even that was around a 50/50 distribution, if that.

So. My opinion is that /r/twoxchromosomes *should* change its focus in order to make reddit more open and tolerant, and just plain *more interesting*. Here's why:

- It can now can act as a broad net, catching a large amount of users interested in or curious about women's issues, and then direct them to smaller subreddits if they eventually feel something is lacking here. 

- Female oriented topics will more frequently appear alongside "general posts." Eventually, I hope they're normalized here. More men can contribute to the conversation, or just learn to ignore it rather than having a negative reaction from seeing it. Maybe they'll have their views changed through simple exposure.

- When you're showing your friends reddit, you can point Two X as a default directed at women. That wasn't possible before. Then tell them to check out the list of related subreddits, because there *are* many more. 

Of course there are going to be people who fuck with the subreddit. But the mods can handle it. If trolls prove too overwhelming, Two X can always leave the default status.

Really, the point of this post is not what's lost, but what reddit is gaining. In order to change how reddit works, things have to change. I don't know if what I've said above will happen or not, but either way, maybe this will settle once and for all whether or not reddit (*as a whole*) can be open to both genders.

It's worth a shot.

**tl;dr:** Read the bullets. That's why they're there.
