Normally I look like I'm smiling a little so this has never happened in the 30 years I've been alive. I really wish I had something witty to retort back but he was past me before I could even give him a dirty look. 

Why is this a thing? I'd rather be catcalled a million times than have someone tell me to smile again. 

Feeling super irritated.
