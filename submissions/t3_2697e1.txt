I was supposed to start my new pack on sunday. Well, today is thursday and I realized I forgot. So I haven't taken my pill in like 4/5 days! 
(I'm safe from pregnancy right now but I will be seeing my boyfriend soon.(LDR))
I've never done this before. What the heck do I do? 

I'm trying reddit after a unsuccessful search through Google. I don't want to have to ask my mom! (I'm 20 but live at home)
