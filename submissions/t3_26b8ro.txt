Exactly what the title says. Every day I see someone on this sub who has experienced negative consequences for having this sub as a default or discussing negative consequences they have seen. I am really tired of having this sub put through the filter of people who are unconcerned with its contents. It's become a less respectful and honestly more circle-jerky sort of place since the change has been made (at least from my perspective).

But when people discuss their unhappiness with the change, it's often a pretty negative discussion without ranged input or full of people who are very frustrated because they feel like they have no avenues of action.

I would really like to hear some honest feedback on this idea. From both sides. I am hoping it will be an open discussion without 'downvotes because I disagree', and I would really like to hear what people think of it. If people do support the idea of a petition, I would love to hear what sort of platform people would prefer, if it should be a vote sort of thing or a sign sort of thing(?).

As for my thoughts, I think Reddit is a very male dominated space, and while I have plenty of love for then men and boys in my life, and appreciate the input of others, it was really nice to be in a place where I felt safe stating my gender, that was less reactionary and aggressive, that welcomed opinions and discussion on female topics. I think it is good that this sub is welcoming of both genders, but I am turned off by the idea of a female-topic sub being put on the feeds of mostly men. I think by having it a default for a site mostly dominated by boys/young men, it's changed the audience and is resulting in a lot of hurt feelings and feelings of... demotion to put it best.

I am happy to discuss and/or answer question my opinion on it, but I want to keep my input short and sweet because I would really like to just hear what you all think.

**TL;DR: what do you think of twoxchromosomes becoming a default? Would you like it to stay that way, or would you prefer it to be removed from the defaults? If you seek change, what sort of avenues do you like? How do you feel about the sub since the change, what seems different/the same?**

Thank you all, I look forward to reading this and just hope it isn't buried before anyone gets a chance to look at it!

Edit: In honor of my post, every comment more than 5 minutes old at this time have all been downvoted by one in the span of 15 seconds! I am sure the individual took time to evaluate each item for content, what it said, and how they felt about it! More I just love how the confirmed the hostility I am addressing. I am sorry that my appeal for discussion/voting bothered you enough to take the time to do that, but you really just proved the point I am making.
