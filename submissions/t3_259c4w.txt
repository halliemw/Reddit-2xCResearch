It's nothing drastic like coming out of the closet or finding out I'm adopted. Honestly, I just need to get this off my chest and it may seem kind of insignificant to even make a post about it. But I just finished my second year of uni, and I don't think that college is or will be my prime/"best time of my life". 

The odds were against me from the start. I go to college in my hometown and still live at home and will continue to due to financial reasons. There was never that "Oooo new city, new me" feeling. Trust me I've made the best of it and tried to make it as new and exciting as humanly possible and at times it was. But at the end of the day I look back and go, "Meh, it wasn't that special". Granted I have been too many parties so I'm no stranger to social gatherings. I have met some really great people who I think are admirable and entertaining to be around andchill with, but I don't ever feel close enough to them to take the friendship step. I also got burned a lot freshman year by kids using me for my car in exchange for what I thought was friendship. So needless to say I have no "besties" male or female. Only glorified acquaintances. 

Before I spiral into self-loathing (because I feel I'm not the norm for your average soon-to-be-junior in college), I should get to the point of this discovery. My prime (I think) will be when I'm out of college and finally doing what I want with my life. College is a means to an end for me really. My "Oooo new city, new me" will happen when I book my first tour, movie, or show out of college (I'm an acting major).

Have any of you graduates or recent university students felt/feel the same? I just feel i'm surrounded by facebook posts of people raving about how much they love college and I kinda feel outcasted that I'm not enthused by anything except learning part. 

TL;DR I don't think college is the prime of my life. Am I weird?
