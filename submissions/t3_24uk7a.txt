Basically Sunday night I went out with friends for bank holiday, we started early so for midnight I was very drunk. I separated from my friends and jumped in a taxi outside the club and told him to take me to my friends house. I told him I only had £16 and he said that was fine (it usually costs £30-£35)

I was trying to contact my friend but he doesn't get good signal, so drunk me was panicking thinking I was going to be abandoned at his house while he wasn't there. The taxi driver drove me around his village until I got through to him. The taxi driver then pulled up and said he "was going to get me on the back seat and treat me nicely" I told him no, I was going to my friends house. He then grabbed me and pulled me in for a kiss, kissed me and grabbed my boobs. He tried taking my pants down but I got out, and luckily my friends neighbour was there to help. It was 1am, she was in her 60s but she has no idea how much I appreciate her being there.

I don't know the taxi company, all I know is the drivers name and I don't know what to do. Sorry it's a little rambly I've just come off nights and I'm all over the place.
