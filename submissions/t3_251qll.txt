I just wanted to talk about our new status, and I guess give my thoughts. 

I love this sub. It is a fantastic community and I really think it's one of the best ran sub that I subscribe to. That being said, I was at first really upset that we went to default. This community that I sincerely care about is being opened up to a massive audience, the heartfelt stories that I connect with are going to be met with pervy and misogynist comments! How could the mods do this?!?

But as I've thought about it, and from the content that's being submitted so far, I don't mind. Why shouldn't we be a default? Our experiences and our content is just as important as anything else that's on the front page, and if anything, I think we are doing more harm to our community if we all jump ship. As women, we shouldn't fear being heard. If we stop posting and commenting, all those who are out to do nothing but troll are getting exactly what they want. The mods have heard up their end of the deal, banning and deleting comments that don't follow our rules in the sidebar. And from the backlash posts I've seen, it just shows how much the users care about this sub. So it's going to take some diligence on all of our parts, report users who are here for the wrong reasons, and KEEP POSTING AND KEEP USING THOSE ARROWS! 

Aaaand that's all I have to say about that.
