A dude in my class muttered under his breath, "I hate this bitch." when a female classmate started talking. I want to say that maybe he's just ignorant, he's still a full human being with intelligence, a sense of humor, [insert more rationalizations]. I used to say "bitch" negatively before I knew the word's subtly oppressive effects. 

Should I still try to hang out with him?
