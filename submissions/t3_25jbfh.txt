I love my shop and like 99% of my customers and really enjoy my days work. 

But the one thing that always irritates me without fail; being called 'girl'.

Generally this is done as a way of thanks after I've helped a customer find something, or advised them on a product and they will say, 'good girl, thanks'. Very occasionally I get 'good woman' but much, much rarer. It is also most generally men who say it.

 I asked my husband who works with me and one of my male employees and they say they will once in a blue moon get told 'good man' but never, ever 'good boy'.

 I also realise that its of no use to be irritated by it, but I can't help it, it just grates on me. I know it is nice, and that they are doing it as a way of saying thanks but I am not a girl. I'm a married woman, running my own business. We live in a very small town and the majority of customers know it is my business. So why call me girl?

EDIT: I'm from Ireland where the saying 'good woman' is very common, and basically means well done. But it's the girl part that annoys me.
