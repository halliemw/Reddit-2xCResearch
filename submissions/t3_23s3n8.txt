I'm 18, female and sexually active. I've had the implant for a little over a year now and it's been giving me problems (bleeding light constantly for 3 months, then recently I've had three very heavy periods a week apart). I've seen 3 GP's about the issues with bleeding and they've all put it down to the implant and hormones. I was given Mefenamic acid to help which made the bleeding worse.

I've never been told that I should see a gyno/ been referred, but from a google/reddit search it seems to be quite an important thing to do when you become sexually active/ go on BC.

Now I'm experiencing pain during sex. I'm going to make an appt with my GP but I'm just worried/annoyed and I assume he'll just put it down to the implant again and it'll never get sorted.

I'm from England, so NHS & I'm not sure if I can contact a gyno directly.

Should I press to be checked by a gyno to make sure everything's ok or am I being silly?
