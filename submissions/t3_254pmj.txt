I'm 19. I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend and we used the pull-out method. Some of the cum dripped down my crotch, and I honestly don't know if any actually got inside. That was 2 or 3 weeks ago. I've been on birth control for about a month now, but I'm using it to skip a couple of periods, so I won't have a period until next month or so. I did the stick pregnancy test and it said "not pregnant". However, I've been having some symptoms of pregnancy, such as thick, white, mostly odorless discharge on my panties, feeling tired throughout the day, my boobs hurt all around the area where they attach to my chest, and I had to get up twice last night to pee and I normally never need to pee throughout the night. Hopefully I'm just over exaggerating,  but I am beginning to get genuinely worried.

Edit: I'm taking Gildess FE 1.5/30 
I've taken this kind before and specifically used it so I wouldn't have a period because I was going on a 3 week trip and I didn't want my period to prevent me from doing anything. I normally have VERY heavy periods.

Edit 2: Thank y'all for y'all's advice and such. It means a lot :)
