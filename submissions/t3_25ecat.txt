If this post is better suited for r/relationships or r/polyamory, then please send me on my way, but I know that Two X Chromosomes is generally a safe space. 

I (24F) have been in a committed relationship with my partner (25M) for two and a half years now. We live together, and plan to do so for the foreseeable future, but we are both open to the idea of having sex with other people as long as we practice safe sex and communicate with each other. I have a long history of low self-esteem and self-harm: I have been raped and I have used meaningless sex to make me feel better about myself. 

My partner is fairly anti-authoritarian and has a great disdain for police officers. I am currently employed as a 911 dispatcher, so I spend a great deal of my time in communications with police officers, ensuring their safety in the field. This has led me to get very close to an officer with whose ethics I greatly identify, a quality that is rare for me to find in the police officers I dispatch. He also happens to be single, attractive, and very much interested in me. I would like to start seeing this man outside of my job (he hangs around the dispatch center when I am working and he is not busy), and I know my partner is okay with me sleeping with other people, but I think he would take issue with me sleeping with a police officer. 

I don't know if I want to sleep with this man simply because he wants to sleep with me and I am going back to my old habits from before I met my partner. I respect him a lot as a person and it is refreshing to work with one officer that I can really identify with. The officer knows I am not single and has not backed down, so I'm not sure if he is trying to pressure me to leave my partner (absolutely not an option), or if he would be okay with sleeping with me without me leaving my partner (possibly an option but only with my partner's consent). having said all of that, I do not know how to explain to my partner that I want this man partially because he is a police officer and I have no one else with whom I can connect in that part of my life. My partner is the most loving and compassionate person you could ever look for, but it takes a huge toll on him to hear about my day at work because what I deal with is often darker and heavier than anyone outside emergency services can really grasp. I need someone with whom I can have sex and share in the darker side of the job. I truly believe that I could have that with that one man I work with, but I don't know how to explain to my partner that I want to have sex with a police officer.

**TL;DR** Committed, semi-open relationship with one man, intense interest in another that my partner may not approve of. Unknown if pursuing the other man would be return to old ways from dark and twisty past, or if it would be helpful to deal with the stress of my current life that I can't share with my partner.

Please help me,
Desperate(ly), devoted dispatcher

**Edit** -ed to add that sex with my partner is generally good. I don't think it's the two and a half year itch, ,or anything like that. We are communicative about our sexual needs with each other and understand each other's need for sexual experiences outside our relationship (i.e masturbation, sex with other people). My only complaint about sex with my partner is that his own past issues often lead him to ejaculate prematurely, and that's not really a big deal usually, but sometimes I just need longer PIV sex than he can manage so that can on occasion get frustrating.
