OK, so my problem is that my friend's younger brother likes me. He flirts with me all the time; I flirt back. I'm a nearly 25 year old female and he's nearly 20. I think I am very susceptible to giving in because it's been over a year since I've even kissed a guy. I am really craving that kind of attention, but I haven't met anyone that makes me feel this sexual since my breakup. In other words, I think about jumping his bones. All. The. Time. I would act on it if I let myself, but I would only want a friends with benefits sort of arrangement and not anything serious for reasons stemming from our obvious age gap. And I just really don't want to be in a relationship right now. A part of me feels like this is a pretty messed up thing to want from someone who is my friend's younger brother. I would want to minimize the risk of drama or ruining our friendship.

tl;dr: My friend's attractive younger brother really likes me (I'm female) and I only want him in a physical way. If he wants me in that way too, and I'm pretty sure he does, how should I handle this situation ethically? As of now, I haven't discussed anything with his sister (who is a strict Catholic and doesn't want to lose her virginity before marriage) and if I do, I would want to minimize the risk of drama or ruining our friendship.
