Hello Ladies! 

So I'm a 21-year-old female (almost 22) and after years of dreaming about it, I'm finally ready to get rhinoplasty. 

Some backround... Ever since I first started to care about looks, I've hated my nose. My nose tip is very wide and droopy when I smile and it seriously bothers me. I have small eyes and small delicate mouth and although my face is square shaped and quite wide, my nose just looks wrong. No matter how pretty I feel, I can't help but wish my nose was different EVERY single time I look in a mirror. I never "truly" smile in photos and that's very depressing. You're supposed to feel beautiful when you smile and I never do. If I'm happy and laughing, it doesn't take long before I remember how my nose looks and then I feel ugly. 

I have told one friend about my plans and she of course said that I'm crazy and I don't need to have anything done. I don't think she's lying because I don't think any of my friends need plastic surgery. They're all so gorgeous! She said that everyone has flaws but they only make you *you*. I have other flaws that I've accepted  but I've waited my whole life to be ok with my nose and that hasn't happened. It makes me so insecure! It's like in my head I'm beautiful but then I look in a mirror or take a photo and see a face that *isn't me*. 

I know it's a huge decision but I feel more confident about it every single day. I also know that I'm still very young but I don't want to take the risk of feeling like this till I'm 40 and regret that I didn't do anything sooner. I want to enjoy my life now damnit. 

How's that for a rant? Anyway, is there anyone in the same situation or someone who has gone through rhinoplasty? Any advice? I worry that people think that I'm really vain and against natural beauty when in fact that is not true at all. I don't want look perfect, I just want to feel beautiful.
