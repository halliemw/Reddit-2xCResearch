During a big hike with the man I'm in love with, he wanted a photo of me so I obliged but I felt uncomfortable about having my stomach rolling over the hip strap of my backpack, and I told him so after he took the photo.  I poked the belly and said I didn't like that it was there.

Without missing a beat, he put the palm of his hand against where I had just poked, and with a genuine, sweet, smile said, *"This?  It's for babies"*.  Then he kinda shrugged (but not in a dismissive way), turned back around, and kept walking forward.

It felt SO GOOD to hear that.  Specifically to hear it said so casually.  A reminder of the simple fact that my body has fat stores for good reasons.

I don't think I'd ever once considered that!  And because of reminders and realizations about what a healthy body is, such as this one, I've decided to only shed a healthy 15-20 of the 30 pounds I've gained over the past two years.  [this is the photo btw](http://imgur.com/FMO4z4u)
