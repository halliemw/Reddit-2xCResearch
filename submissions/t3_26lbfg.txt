So... I have always faked vaginal orgasms. I love vaginal sex, it feels great and fulfilling, but its not gonna get me off. And thats fine! I have come to terms with that!

But for many of the men I've been with, not so much. When I am honest about never having a g-spot orgasm, many are convinced that "I can ALWAYS get a girl off, you just havent been with a man like me." Others dont have as much pleasure from the experience, because they enjoyed 'making me feel good' and dont understand that I could still enjoy the process without the orgasm at the end. Either way, I have just learned to fake it and everyone is happier.

So my current partner started out the same way, but turns out we fell in love and have been together for a little over a year now. We have moved in together, started sharing finances, etc. But I have never told him that I fake it when we have sex.

Now of course the clitoris gets lots of attention which is great! He does a damn fine job. I know I am being dishonest, but it seems like a bit of a white lie - it makes him feel good about the sex and about himself. And there is nothing he could do 'better' even if I did tell him, since my vag is just a bit numb and doesnt orgasm. 

So do I tell him? And how? I am just anticipating a bit of a dramatic reveal, where he yells "how could you lie to meeeee"
