Hello TwoX! I have a problem and was hoping you ladies could give me some advice. Some info about me: I am in my early 20s, a virgin, and have yet to visit the gynecologist. That last bit is changing as soon as school starts again though, my university has a women's clinic on campus and is a lot cheaper, so I'll just wait until then. (Also financially speaking, I have no choice but to wait.)

My problem is, no matter how hard I try and shove those things in there, I can't! It's becomes too painful. The farthest I've had one up there is about half way. I have to admit though, I haven't tried too many different ways to do it. I've only ever tried while sitting on the John. I'm not sure what else to try. I'd be alright with pads for the rest of my life if:

* It didn't feel like a dam broke in my pants every time I got up for my chair

* I couldn't feel the flow and scraps of uterus coming out

* It didn't feel like I was wearing a diaper and worried it looked like I was

* I didn't have to be paranoid that I had leaked on the side (my anxiety level skyrockets during that *special* time of the month)

* If I could play sports comfortably (the major reason I've decided to make the change)

But that isn't the case. I've been cursed to use the mighty pad since everyone's favorite Aunt decided to drop in every month. So! Besides going to see the gyno, any ideas on what's wrong with me or what I can do to shove the cotton rocket where it belongs?

EDIT: Thank you for all of the suggestions! To be clear the one's that I have tried are the: "Tampax Pearl- Compaks"
Also, why is this getting so many down votes? It's an honest question. :/
