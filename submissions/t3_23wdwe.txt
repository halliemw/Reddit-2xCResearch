Hello, ladies. I apologize in advance if this seems crazy/trivial, but I have no close girlfriends to talk to right now and am hoping you can offer advice and perspective. 

About 2 months ago I met this guy on OKCupid, we hit it off right away, he was super good looking, I couldn't believe my luck. We met about 2 weeks after our first chat, he brought me flowers (I'd never gotten flowers from a guy before!), was extremely gentlemanly, and sweet. I've never had to guess how he feels about me, always tells me how pretty I am, and is so respectful and thoughtful. He treats me how I've always wanted a guy to treat me since I've been interested in dating.

But I feel nothing. Over the last few weeks I have felt progressively less and less for him, and he's done nothing wrong. At first I thought maybe it's that he's awkward? Am i expecting things to be how they are with my best friend (who is a guy)? But it took forever for us to be comfortable. Do I have to wait with him too? I'd feel better about him once he held my hand or kissed me. So, as you can imagine, I've been quite confused. 

Well, I just got home from a date with him and now I know i have to end it. We went to the movies and I found myself hoping he wouldn't be affectionate, and when he was I felt nothing at all. It felt so wrong. 

Am I broken? Because that's how I feel. How can I feel nothing for the sweetest, most thoughtful man I've ever met?  And how do I do this?? I've never broken up with someone, and all i want to do is run. But i know that only makes things worse.

Thank god Closer just came. The TV always knows how I'm feeling.
