So my gf sent me this article: http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/05/21/314586804/anxiety-and-mris-may-be-driving-the-rise-in-double-mastectomies

We were trying to figure out why women would choose to go for a double mastectomy even if they had no increased risk for getting breast cancer in the other breast. So for those of you out there who chose to receive a preventative double mastectomy I was hoping you could share your reasons. Specifically I'm addressing the women as described in the article where they had cancer in one breast only and genetic testing showed that they had no increased chance of getting cancer in the other breast. Thank you!
