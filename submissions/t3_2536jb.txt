Could anyone share their stories of their first few weeks on ~~antidepressants~~ mood stabilizer? I'm on day 4 and last night I barely got any sleep; this was supposed to fix my nosleep problem! Is it interacting with my BC pill or something? I take ortho cyclen and it has helped level my mood out a lot (it used to be all over the place).

I'm taking it in the mornings as instructed.
