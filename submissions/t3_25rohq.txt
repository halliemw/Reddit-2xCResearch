My daughter's girlfriend has been out of school for over a week now with mono. Kid isn't showing symptoms yet but I worry because exams are coming soon. I know they have at least kissed a lot. GF was over here about 5 days before she was pulled out of school - so two weeks? Is that long enough that I shouldn't worry?
