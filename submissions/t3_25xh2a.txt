My anniversary with my (male) partner is coming up in one week's time. We've had a wonderful year, but also a tough one in many ways. I want to do something special for him, but I can't figure out what would be best to do. 

He doesn't like gifts because he doesn't like to have a lot of things. We're fairly broke (yay graduate school). We'd hoped to go on a trip together, but it is impossible because of work schedules. We've talked about proposals and marriage for a while, but he's made it clear that he wants to propose to me (and I don't want to put pressure on him that way). 

What are some romantic gestures that a man might like? How do you make your partner (male or female) feel special on special occasions? How does one romance a man, as a woman?
