My boyfriend and I were at his parents house, and his mom started arguing with his dad about something. Then she told him to apologize to my boyfriend for what he did to him in bed when he was little and everyone needed to know what he did. Then my boyfriend's dad said something about how everyone already knows, and she started yelling that he watched porn with my boyfriend.. so I guess that's sexual abuse? That was all the detail I got. Im not sure if he actually touched my boyfriend or how old he was at the time.

After his parents were done arguing, his dad said he needed to talk to him in private. They talked for maybe ten minutes and then my boyfriend came back and sat by me. I asked him if he was okay, and he was like "yeah I'm fine!" like whatever they talked about or whatever happened was no big deal. 

I dont think his mom is lying, because his dad was going along with it and saying how much he regretted it but couldn't change anything, etc.

I have no idea what all happened, if it's as bad as it sounds, how old my boyfriend was or what. I don't know what to do about this. We've been together for almost five years and he has never said anything to me about it. Should I talk to him or leave it alone? We see his dad and mom really frequently, I would say at least twice a week, but I really do not feel comfortable around my boyfriend's dad if he molested my boyfriend. If I should talk to him what should I even say? 

We have been having issues in bed, and he has self esteem problems, but I dont want to assume that it has something to do with being molested... but there's also a chance that whatever happened greatly affected him. I don't know what to do.
