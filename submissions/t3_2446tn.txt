So I've been having what I thought were yeast infections for about two years now, my vagina would flare up like a  baboons butt and I would get irritation and itching, sometimes I couldn't help rubbing it through my undies or with a piece of fabric to get temporary relief that turned into unbearable pain. They usually disappeared with my period so I didn't think much of it. I only used the suppository once and it worked. 

I've been having issues for a few days now and I finally brought it up to my live in boyfriend that I *needed* medicine. Today I went to get it and decided just to get anti itch cream and one of the vagicil tester things. It said my pH was highly raised (like 6.5-7) it said I most likely have BV or Trich. I'm freaking out. My boyfriend is supportive an when asked he said he had slight burning and irritation. We have been together for over a year and sexually active for most of that time. I'm on BC so we don't use protection (stupid I know but we were 17-21 when we got together) I'm planning on going to planned parenthood next week with him to both get checked out, I'm new to the city and super broke so it's all I can think to do. I'm scared.
