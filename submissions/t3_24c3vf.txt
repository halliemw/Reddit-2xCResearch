I've recently had a falling out with a friend. To be honest, we've been falling out of step for more than a year. I've listened to her hours-long emotional spillovers, accepted her tantrums (including stomping feet, slamming doors, and doing that behave-like-a-kid fake-crying thing that's apparently popular nowadays), helped her out of a number of sticky situations, and practically twisted my *self* to not offend her. Over the last five years, I've tried to keep the peace between her and my other friends when she insults them and just cringed internally at her snide remarks about my ability to achieve my goals. I regret so much defending her when my other friends told me she was a bigot (turns out she is totally a bigot).

But it was just too much when she said she wanted to surround herself with "high-quality" people, and apparently I'm not? I've been told what she says about me: I'm unrefined, I wear beat-up clothes, it's weird that I'm not dating ("eew maybe she's lesbian" -- yeah, I am, and it hurts when you say that), and I spend a ton of my time doing something she finds totally boring. She is so certain that she is going to get accepted to This Graduate Program that she reneged on something we'd discussed weeks ago, leaving me in a sudden pickle. 

Unsarcastically: I hope she gets into That Graduate Program. It means a lot to her, and I still hope she finds happiness in life.

But: I just want to be her acquaintance, not her friend. Someone I wave hello to and do favors for if convenient, but not someone whose opinion about my worth that I care about, and not someone that I invest time in, to go out of the way to help. 

Yet: it hurts inside, like something was lost. I'll be happier without her in the long-run, but for now it hurts. 

How do I make it stop? (Also, Aunt Flo is making her monthly rounds, so everything is 20x worse.)
