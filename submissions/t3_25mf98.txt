I know these people exist. My mom has never gotten her ears pierced, one of her best friends got hers pierced but let them heal over, and one of my best friends from college never got her ears pierced. I didn't even think about it for most of my life.

But I was recently introduced to the idea that pierced ears is, at least, a "girl thing," and since then I've been noticing people's ears and looking for individuals who aren't pierced. And I've hardly seen any women without piercings!

I don't want to get my ears pierced. I like the way they look and feel when they are totally smooth without any holes in them. A lot of people look amazing with plugs or studs or whatever suits them, but it's not my style and I'm feeling a bit alone. ):
