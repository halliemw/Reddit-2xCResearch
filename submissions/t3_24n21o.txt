I(22f) work at a well known top hotel in my city that faces the river. We are currently doing a contest as to who can get more guests to upgrade to the water. One gir(26f)l is in first, I'm in second, and a guy(44m) is in third. He's already the guy at work that was consistently in a bad mood and pretty much just a Debbie Downer all the time. He started making comments about how of course girls would be the top upgraders because we are hooking up with guests or showing our boobs. Everytime he'd look at the upgrade board he would call us whores. At first I would ignore him but it started getting really uncomfortable to the point where I hated asking if people wanted an upgrade because I knew he would say something raunchy. So I told our boss. Now the douchebag is completely ignoring all females at work while being over the top buddy buddy with all the guys. How the hell am I supposed to deal with the rest of the day? I feel like I haven't don't anything wrong.
