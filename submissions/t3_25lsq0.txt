I've (21/F) been on the pill off and on for 5 years and literally can't remember the last time I forgot to take it on time. I almost always take it within an hour or two hour window, and am aiming to be even more precise with the time by now setting an alarm. I've never had any sort of pregnancy scare or pregnancy.

My previous partner had always pulled out to be safe, however my current partner (monogamous, not worried about STDs) was the first that had come inside and I really enjoy not pulling out. We have been having sex 2-3 times a week for the past 6 months and he has always came inside.

However, his dad recently gave the lecture about being extra safe since neither one of us wants me to get pregnant and his dad strongly recommended using a condom, pulling out, AND having me stay on the pill. Neither of us like condoms but he is considering whether or not we should start pulling out as well.

I don't disagree that it would be even more safe but if I use the pill perfectly is it really necessary to pull out as well or should I be pretty much covered? I've read that perfect use for the first year is 99.7% effective, so does that mean 3 out of every 1,000 women who use the pill perfectly get pregnant a year? Also, all the studies I've read only use the first year of use. Since I've been on the pill for so long does that change the effectiveness for the better?

I know this ultimately comes down to a decision me and my boyfriend have to make but we want to be informed. I really enjoy not pulling out and would be bummed to make the switch but not as bummed as I would be if I were to get pregnant.
