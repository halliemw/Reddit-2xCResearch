I recently became a stay-at-home mom.  It was the right decision for my family; I was in a dead-end job, my attempts to advance were continuously unsuccessful, I hated my job, and financially, we're actually better off this way because we don't have to pay for childcare.  Yeah, the job was THAT bad.

And I'm happy.  I really am.  I get to spend a lot of wonderful time with my [adorable baby boy.](http://imgur.com/a/IIERj)

It's been a month.  In that month, I've seen friends, and seen lots of family, and even attended a family wedding, and I've noticed one thing that I didn't expect: *nothing I have to say is of any interest to anyone anymore.*

Suddenly, my life is boring (except that it's not) and I couldn't possibly have opinions on anything (except that I'm better informed than I've been in years).  Nobody asks me questions.  People barely respond when I say things.

Is this a common phenomenon, or am I being oversensitive because I have enough time on my hands to overanalyze this shit now?  I feel more whole than I have since I graduated college.  Why does this choice put me beneath the level of small-talk?
