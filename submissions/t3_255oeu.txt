My heart is aching. I am so tired of being sad about my dad. I want to get over it, but every time I think about it I just cry.


When my parents were married,  my dad practically worshipped the ground I walked on. He was the best dad. 


He married someone else with a daughter when I was 7. This woman never liked me or my two brothers. My dad never once defended us from her. He just stood by quietly. She did horrible things to us. I don't want to get into that too much. 


This woman always made sure my dad did not spend any time alone with him. Not that he was some defenseless victim, he went along with it. My dad became the perfect dad to my step sister. It was, and still is, devastating. My stepmother rubbed it in my face the last time I saw her. She was going on about my step sister's father in law and how good of a man he is. She said, "She just must feel so good and secure having two wonderful dads." She kept saying that. How great it must be for her to have a dad that loves her that much. I just left. I was shocked that she could  be that cruel.


Now, I'm an adult and have a baby. When I was pregnant I thought that he would try to have something to do with his grandson after he was born. I was wrong and I feel like a let down little girl all over again.


I'm angry with myself for ever getting my hopes up. I don't know why I thought it would be different. I just cannot kill my hope that someday he'll be the father I need.


I have never really told him how I feel. I don't know if I should,  or if I should just completely cut all contact with him and his other family. It wouldn't be hard, they never talk to me anyway. I don't even know what I would say. Every time I try, I just get choked up and stop talking. 

I need some advice. He's going to call me later. I just want to feel better about it.
