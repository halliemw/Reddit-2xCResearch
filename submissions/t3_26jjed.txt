Hi guys. This happened hours ago and I'm still really shaken; I think it could help to share what happened.

I live in a small apartment complex, and I'm on the first floor. It's a  studio, with a big window near my bed. My girlfriend was at work, and I was sleeping in til 11. We leave the window open when we're home, even if asleep, since it's a pretty safe neighborhood, and we're not on a main road or anything.

I wake up around 10, to the sound of rustling blinds. I sleepily call out for my girlfriend, thinking she's home for some reason. A mans voice then says, 'hi,' very shocked, like he wasn't expecting anyone home. I then slur, 'who are you??', still half asleep. I get no answer, and figure it was a dream, so roll over back to sleep.

I wake up shortly after, and just for peace of mind, check the window for signs of tampering. The screen has been pushed over, leaving it open. I panic, push it shut, call my girlfriend and mom, and cry. 

We decided not to call the police, since I doubt they could do anything at this point. It's an hour later, I touched the screen so there won't be any fingerprints, and nothing was stolen. We're calling the apartment managers when the offices open tomorrow, though, to inform them what happened. 

We figure he saw the lights off and the window open, thought no one was home, but scared off. I'm just terrified, since this is a very safe community, and I never thought I'd have to deal with this. I'm very petite, I don't have a gun or anything but a kitchen knife, and I'm home alone a lot. We have to have the windows open if we're home, or else it gets humid and smelly in here. We'll start closing them at night, though. 

Sorry for the length, it feels good to get it out, though. Any advice on how to maybe improve security and feel safer?
