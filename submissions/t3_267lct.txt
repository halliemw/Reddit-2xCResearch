I'm just kinda curious - was thinking about this today and realised most people call me "ma'am", even though I'm in my early 20's. I'll go ahead and throw out there that I'm transsexual (female), so that's why I was wondering if it's normal or not. I've only been called "miss" a few times, and that was when I was 17 or so (and once by an inebriated man on the bus at Disney World).

So yeah, what's been your experience with that, as cis women?
