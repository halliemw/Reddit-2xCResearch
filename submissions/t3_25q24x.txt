You need to have this shit on deck. 

After I got my eye brows waxed for my sister's wedding I started breaking out super bad around my brow and so did she, the goddamn bride who worked so hard to keep her face clear was breaking out like teenage girl. After calling the salon and asking what worked best we went out and got some Witch-Hazel. Within a few hours both of our faces were no longer red and the bumps were going down. After multiple applications throughout the day the ugly bumps and redness were nearly gone the second day, by the third day they were completely gone, nothing but smooth skin left behind!

I have always had ugly bumps due to shaving irritation for my area "down there." After I discovered this magical stuff worked on my brow line I tried it down there. OMG instant relief from the itching and the bumps are clearing up! Even the blemishes on my chest are clearing up!

SO- in conclusion- you need to have this as a staple in your beauty supply. This shit is amazing. 

EDIT: Thanks for pitching in, everyone! I never new the this product had this many powers!
