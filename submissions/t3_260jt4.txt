Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my username.

It's not a huge issue but I think it might be over the long term. We've been together for 2 years now but lately I've noticed that my boyfriend's mother has a really low opinion of women, particularly women my age.

I should preface this by saying that we get on brilliantly, she's almost a surrogate mother to me at times. But in her job she deals with a lot of young women who make poor decisions (trying to vague this up as much as possible) and so seems to think that the same is true of me- or at least that's the impression she gives off at times.

Last night she was giving us advice on our housing situation and she basically said that if there's a problem, look for the woman. 

Because women are really the only ones who cause issues... /s

The actual situation has nothing to do with the woman involved, but it really got to me that she instantly went to that. It also feels like she thinks my boyfriend is weakwilled and is liable to be 'taken in' by a controlling woman- it's never mentioned overtly by her at least (though it has by him) but that is the feeling I'm getting. He is probably the least weakwilled person I've ever known so I don't know why she assumes that's likely.
  
I just feel like she doesn't respect women which is odd as she's in a senior position in a male dominated field, so I thought if anyone would get it she would. 

Basically just wanted to vent, but feel free to give advice if you want.
