Lemme go ahead and say the reason I haven't gone to see my gyno is because I've been living with my boyfriend ~14 hours away from my home for the past few months and haven't been home long enough to schedule a visit. I also heard that spotting/periods lasting a long time is normal for nexplanon/implanon, but it's getting to the point where I'm thinking I need to look at some other options than just waiting. Due to medical conditions on my boyfriend's side, we haven't been able to have sex anyway. 

For the first few months I had light spotting, light enough that a panty liner a day was enough, and I was okay with that. In February the spotting stopped all together and I thought I had finally seen the light until it everything started up again a few weeks later. I thought maybe it was just a period but it's been going on pretty much non stop since March, and it's gotten heavier recently.

Now I'm looking for anyone who has had a somewhat similar experience, and asking what did you do? Did you have it removed? Did you switch to a different BC? I've also heard of women taking a daily pill to get periods under control, but that kinda defeats the purpose of why I got Nexplanon in the first place. I'm almost 20 and I have a history of being bad at remembering to take medications daily. 

Even before I got Nexplanon, I had awful periods. They lasted two weeks, were irregular, and very heavy. Am I just doomed to shitty periods forever? I know Nexplanon affects everyone differently but I just need some hope.
