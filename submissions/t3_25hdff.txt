I've been having a lot of strange symptoms lately & Google-ing is making me crazy. I know I should go to the doctor but I feel like I'm over reacting. But the seriousness of the conditions my symptoms point to are troubling. 

* I've been getting 2 periods a month for 3 months


*hot flashes


*weight gain 


*bad acne where I had none before


*exaustion


*bad mood swings


*pelvic pain with & without sex


From what I've gathered I could be perimenopausal, have PCOS, uterine fibroids, or have have a thyroid problem. But I still feel like the doctor will just run a few tests & then say I'm fine. Do any of you guys have any experience with symptoms or disorders I listed here?
