I really don't live in a bad area. But some of the parking lots I go to to pick up a quick dinner or stop at the pharmacy are a little sketchy. I don't have any big issue with people soliciting for money. Everyone has to get by in some way. But when I'm walking alone in a parking lot, and in my car, do NOT APPROACH ME AND ASK FOR MONEY. I feel trapped! A month ago I was in my car waiting to pick up a pizza when I man tapped on my CAR WINDOW and said something along the lines of "Hey pretty mama how bout some change." I was shocked. That's my private space. It's dark. I'm alone. I shouted NO! out of shock and he walked away calling me a range of profanities. I thought it was a fluke until it happened AGAIN yesterday in the pharmacy parking lot! Again a man knocked on my window and asked for money. I said GO AWAY loudly. Am I over reacting? My car is my private space. That makes me feel trapped. Of course I could beep or drive away if something bad happened, but it makes me extremely nervous and uncomfortable.
Has this happened to anyone else? What is the appropriate response?
