Hi ladies! I'm on my throwaway for a sensitive topic: my lady bits. But I'm talking all of them, breasts, hips, vulva, thighs, every part of me you'd say was distinctly womanly.

I hate all of them.

Every part has something wrong with it. The more private the place, the worse the problem. My breasts are medically malformed, my labia are long and dark, my hips and thighs are huge and covered in stretch marks and cellulite, and I feel...gross.

I hate taking my clothes off. I hate being looked at. I don't have any of your typical insecurity issues, I don't think I need to lose more than a few pounds, I'm actually kind of pretty with clothes on, but without them I'm just a disappointment. I particularly hate being touched on my ugly parts, which as you can imagine has ruined my sex life. Just the thought of oral sex makes me cringe. I'd rather tell a guy I was born without breasts than show him the ones I have.

Now I'm getting into a new relationship and I'm terrified. What do I do when he wants to see me naked? How do I keep him from leaving me when he sees all of it? I can't even take my bra off when we sleep in the same bed, even with a shirt on, because he'd see the outline of my fucked up boobs. He's already starting to notice how self conscious I am, but I told him I'm just "shy."

Does anyone else have this problem? How do you deal with it? Help!

EDIT: So your comments really motivated me and I told him. I feel really weird about it now, but it's kind of liberating.
