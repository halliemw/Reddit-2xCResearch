I'm using a throwaway because I'm about to admit one of my darkest, deepest secrets.

I know that we are told by society that we have to love our mothers.  That we are family and we have to stick together.  That as women, our mothers should be our best friends.

But is it okay to just flat-out dislike your mother?

I often lay awake at night, unable to sleep because I am distraught over my feelings about my mother and how they conflict with how we are programmed to feel.  I know that if we weren't related, I would never speak to her.  I also know that if I didn't feel so horribly guilty about abandoning her, I wouldn't speak to her now.

My mom is incomprehensibly lazy.  She is a narcissist and her selfishness knows no bounds.  She lives in a fantasy world in which she  is never accountable and everyone else is to blame.  She cannot handle the truth.  She also believes everything is about her and nobody could possibly be more sick, more tired, more stressed, or more overworked than she.  And the worst part is that I think she is, deep down, jealous of my sisters and me for whatever reason.  Being around her makes me physically ill and stressed out for days after a visit.

The truth is, I deeply dislike her.  And these feelings make me sick.  

Ladies, do you have a similar experience?  How do you cope?   I hope I am not alone.
