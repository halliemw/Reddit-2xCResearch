I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask since I've only just found this subreddit exists, but I figured I would ask. I've always had a problem with thick, cracked skin on my heels and I've never been able to manage it even with pumice stones. It's gotten a lot worse lately and I can peel it off in chunks by hand, but I can't help but feel this is a) inefficient, and b) not good for my skin. I'm tired of my socks snagging on my heels every time I put them on. What can I do? Do those pedegg things or whatever they're called really work? I can't help but think of a cheese grater every time I look at one.
