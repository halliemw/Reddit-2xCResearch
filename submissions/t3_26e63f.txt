I realized at work last week, after taking out a tampon in the bathroom, that my stash in my purse had been depleted. So, no big deal, I figured -- there's a machine in all the women's bathrooms for 10-cent tampons. But after trying to stick a dime in the slot for probably a full two minutes (it was as if the slot was blocked, but there's was no "out of order" or "empty" sign), I gave up and head to the other bathroom, where the tampon machine does have an "out of order sign."

It brought back teenage memories of desperately trying to stick a quarter in those weird crank machines and failing, or realizing with dismay that there isn't one in a bathroom at all -- if I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure my ALL-GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL didn't have tampon machines in the bathrooms.

Because I never could figure those machines out, over time I just got used to always being prepared, or being comfortable with just asking a friend for one. I Googled "how to use tampon machine" today, and there's nothing but videos of young girls being confused and message board posts with a bunch of "Hm, I dunno, never use em" replies.

What the hell?! Isn't this the equivalent of a men's bathroom without a urinal? I'm guessing these shitty machines are never addressed because women don't feel comfortable complaining about them to management. When I think about it, the only time I've ever seen a box of free tampons in a public bathroom was at a country club. Really? Should these really be luxury items when they're as vital as toilet paper?
