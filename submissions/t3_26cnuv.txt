Throwaway because I'm still so ashamed.

Last year I was a senior in high school and I was sexually assaulted by a junior. I don't really want to go into details due to me still having issues getting over this. I at least have told someone and I'm getting better, so that's easier.

But I told someone only recently. This happened a year ago. This guy got really violent and I was terrified. I was able to get away after some difficulties, but I also let him get away. I feel awful. He's still going to that school and he could have done this to other girls and could still be doing it because I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyway.  

I barely remember his name or face and I don't know what to do. The school probably wouldn't even listen to me or believe me. This guilt is just killing me.
