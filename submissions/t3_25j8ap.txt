1. I have no idea what the general thought of abortion is on this subreddit
2. I want to try to keep this as civil as I can.
3. Have good counter points? Share them.

I have a problem with the "your body, your choice." Once you make the choice to have sex, shouldn't you be fully ready to accept the possible outcome? You lost the "choice" when you decided to have sex.

All medical facts aside; Does it matter if the fetus can't feel pain? A human shouldn't be based on the kinetic, focus on the potential. We all could become the next big fill In the blank, so why would you take away that chance for the baby?

This wasn't constructed to my best because of time, but had to get it out. Comments?
