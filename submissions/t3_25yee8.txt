Whenever I fly, I always start bleeding! Ever since my first flight about 4 years ago, I've noticed that there's something about the air pressure or altitude or maybe even stress of flying that makes my period come weeks or days early. I've always had regular periods and I find this strange. After spending around 24 hours flying and with a couple layovers, yesterday sure enough I once again started bleeding 2 weeks early. So frustrating! Does this happen to anyone else? And I'd really like to know why.
