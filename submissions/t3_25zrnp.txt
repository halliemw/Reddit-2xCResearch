So how my birth control is packaged is it's in 4 rows - 3 white, 1 green. I start from the left, go right, then start on the left on the next row. However I was thinking and I took my first green pill as the one on the far right. I didn't realize until the next day... After the condom broke. I took the non-name brand plan b to be safe, but I'm worried about whether or not the effectiveness is decreased or not. Can you guys explain and hopefully quell my worries? I'm stressing out since the morning after pill can push my period a week and I won't know if I'm pregnant until my next period (I'm in an unexpected situation where a pregnancy test is impossible to get)
