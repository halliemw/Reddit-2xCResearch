So this year, I'm really self conscious about swimming. Over the winter I had an operation (appendicitis), along with a concussion, and that led to me gaining weight, along with some nice little scars on my midsection. 
My friends and I are planning on having a pool party, and I need to buy a swimsuit, because I've grown since last year. I lost my tan from the summer and I'm really worried about it, since I've been out a bit, but I have horrible T-shit and Shorts tan lines, then I'm like a freaking vampire. 

Any suggestions???

*note, I'm a bit more of a tomboy, and so I'm a bit timid about showing my figure and everything*
