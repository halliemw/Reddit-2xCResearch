My grandma and I have always been very close. She took care of me after school when I was a kid, and she supported me moving across the country a few years back. She really has supported anything I have ever wanted to do. We've kept in touch by twice weekly phone calls and Christmas-time visits since I moved, but she made my family swear not to tell me her cancer was back. She is almost 90 though, and even though she wants to keep fighting, her body doesn't. It wasn't until this past Wednesday when my mom called and told me that Gram had entered hospice that I even knew. I left work early and drove the 14 hours back to my hometown that day. Now that I am here though, I don't know what to say to my grandma other than "I love you."

What do I say to the person who has been my lifetime supporter and the most kick-ass woman that I have ever known? We have so little time left, and I can't seem to think of anything worthy of filling the time I have with her. I am lost for words and I feel lost in every other way.
