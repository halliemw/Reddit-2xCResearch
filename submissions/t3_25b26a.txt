I was at a conference Wednesday night to Saturday afternoon. I also had an event to go to after the conference. I went straight home after the event. When I got home I wanted to just hug him, kiss him, and be with him because I really missed him. He was not as excited. I don't know what happened, but i told him i missed him a lot. he blocked my hands from hugging him and he started saying that if I missed him so much then why didn't I come straight home to see him, why did I go to the event? I started telling him how I felt like I needed to support someone and how it was part of my job. There was no obligation for me to go, but I wanted to support someone there. Anyway he started saying how I was lying, that I said I could blow it off and now I was saying that it was an obligation! I don't like arguing over things that get you nowhere. So I stopped trying to argue. Eventually I started crying. He asked why I was crying. And I told him that I was eager to come home and be with him and how he does not believe me and I don't know what to do. He didn't reply. He is passive aggressive. This was last night. I slept from about 6pm-8am. This afternoon he started getting ready...and then about 5 minutes before leaving, he asked me if I wanted to go to lunch with his mom. I said no. I feel like every time I see him be so cold with me I cry, so if I go I'm just going to cry. I really just needed to vent and wondering if anyone else has been through a similar scenario? Usually these things blow over and I can't wait for it to blow over because I still just want to hug and kiss him.
