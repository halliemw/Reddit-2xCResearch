Hey Two X!
 I just wanted some other women's perspectives on something that has been bothering me. Last night, my boyfriend had a friend over to our apartment to stay the night. Let's call him Sven. We were all in the bed (it's a pretty big bed) and I was starting to fall asleep. I was still awake when Sven starts receiving these texts while my boyfriend is playing a computer game. Sven says that he is becoming friends with this "chick". Then...Sven starts showing my boyfriend the texts that this girl is sending. I didn't read them, but I know they are sexual. And Sven is just like, "I love my life....getting pics now...haha." And Sven might've showed my boyfriend the pictures. I didn't say anything because at this point I'm falling asleep. 
I'm really pissed off about this. One it's really awkward if he was getting a boner while sleeping in our bed. Second, I'm mad at Sven because I feel this behavior isn't respectful. If Sven did show my boyfriend some of the pictures, then it is even more of an issue because the girl meant those as private pictures. I'm mad at my boyfriend for not saying anything. Just overall, I feel like Sven can only appreciate women for their sexuality.
