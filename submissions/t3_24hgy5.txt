I've had my cup for over 1,5 years until today when I finally tossed it in the trash. After the initial learning curve, I managed to make it work "successfully" for a few months, but the times it didn't work have always outweighed the times it did. Even when inserted properly with a good seal, it still made me feel like I had to pee all the time, and gave me horrible cramping in addition.

So... no more leakage/not sealing, no more increased cramping, or having to move it aside to pee properly. Bye-bye Diva Cup, hello again tampons.

Anyone else give up on the cup after having given it the 'ole college try? :(
