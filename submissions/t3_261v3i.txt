So I'm single and about to be 26. I feel like I should have my life together, but I don't. I'm still living paycheck to paycheck and I don't really see a way out of that cycle anytime soon. Being a woman and all, I want kids one day and I wish that I didn't have to have the time pressure to hurry up and make it happen. Feeling stressed about life in general at this point. Single successful women, how did you do it? Were you once in my position?
