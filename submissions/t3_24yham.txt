I've been on the pill for a few months and everything works fine. I don't use other form of protection, because I make perfect use of them (meaning, I take them every single day at the same time, haven't taken medicines that could interfere or had vomits or diarrhea). I never experienced any spotting nr disturbances with my period. Had it normally for two cycles, although lighter than it used to be when I didn't take the pills. Now, last week I was on the placebo week, and my period came on time thursday morning as always but it was a tad lighter than before and only lasted two days an a half. What concerns me here is that, on the last day (the 'half day') I ate some weed cookies, and had a really bad experience. My period stopped that night, and I've been feeling odd ever since. I don't have any pregnancy symptoms, except for some nausea this morning and stomach disturbances. 
I'm talking to my boyfriend tonight to make a pregancy test to rule out anything, but what I'm looking for here is some support and advice to ease my mind. I think the nausea and stomach disturbances are more due to the fear and stress of a possible pregnancy (which would come as another problem to add to the pile of them I'm going through right now). 
I'd appreciate any kind words, ladies, even though I'm making a fuzz out of anything.
