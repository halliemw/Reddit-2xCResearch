The link does a good job of summarizing what happened, and I hope that you awesome ladies can show your support!

This woman has been incredibly active on campus; she has done many great things in terms of researching how the university handles rape and other things of that nature (it's too much to write down) by asking really hard questions and not giving up. I admire her strength so much and I'm so proud of what she's accomplished in such a short time.

edit to add, she is a fellow student.
