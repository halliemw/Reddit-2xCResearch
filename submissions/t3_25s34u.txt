So it's 4:30 a.m. and I haven't been able to sleep because I'm just freaking out. I found out today that the guy who date raped me (a "friend" at the time) is moving across the street from me. 

As I said, we were friends before it happened in the fall and a lot of our mutual friends for the time live in this neighborhood (which is why I moved here). I still see his car parked down the street often, and I still get the urge to take a baseball bat to it everytime. I've restrained myself thus far. 

But the idea of him being literally right outside my window makes me feel ill. I've cut off all contact with him but I know seeing him will become inevitable. Suddenly the parties won't be a block away, but outside my door. 

I just don't really know what to do about it. I resigned my lease a month ago because I'm extremely poor and it's an amazing location for a good price. I can't break my lease without being responsible for all of the remaining payments. I'm going to try subletting but I know it will be near impossible because it's a one bedroom in a college town, and expensive at that (I live with my boyfriend so it's split, hence why it's cheap individually).

I'm obviously going to try to move out, but it really sucks because I love my apartment and I've put so much work into it to make it my safe haven and I just feel like yet another thing is being stripped away from me because of this event. 

I just wanted to complain really and come to you guys for some moral support, especially in the event that I'm not able to sublet and am stuck here for a year having to see him everyday.
