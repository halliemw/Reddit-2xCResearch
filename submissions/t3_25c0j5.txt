As the title says, my new boyfriend's ex posted [this](http://imgur.com/aR06NND) and then added "at least her ugly partsâ€¦."

I get the actual New Girl part of it, but what the hell does the ugly parts thing mean?? 

I should also mention that I am 24, she is 27, and I haven't experienced anything like this since middle school. I literally don't even understand half of the insults that she hurls my way.
