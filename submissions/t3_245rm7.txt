I am 24 and my boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now and people (mostly my coworkers) won't stop bothering me about when we're going to get married and/or have kids. The other week I was doing a project with some people I don't normally interact with and one of the women asked how many kids I have. I said something like "oh I don't have any, I'm only 24, not ready yet" and they all LAUGHED at me. One was like "please I had my first kid when I was 16." Ok that's great for you and all but I'm a little too old now to have my first kid at 16, and how does that even apply to me? Am I some kind of old hag for not having kids yet? 

I usually say I just want to be financially stable before I have children and of course EVERY PERSON EVER has to say "oh you'll never be able to afford kids so you might as well just have them." Wtf? I'm barely scraping by right now. My boyfriend and I don't make much more than minimum wage and are staying with his parents to save up for a house/eventual wedding. Down the line we will hopefully have better jobs and our own house. There is a huge difference in financial stability there and I am sure I will feel much better prepared to take care of a baby in the future vs. right now, where I have to juggle between paying my phone bill on time or my car insurance etc. Yet people just seem to act like it's not big deal "might as well have one now lol you're getting old!!" 

Sorry for the rant but has anyone else had to deal with this??
