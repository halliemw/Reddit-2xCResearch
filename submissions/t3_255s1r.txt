I've lurked at reddit for a long time.  When I read a TMI thread, I realized that I wanted to contribute.  So I'm new but I'm not new.

I'm in my late 40s, I'm a Christian fundamentalist.  I don't get my feelings hurt easy and I'm not one to lecture others about their decisions.  I don't give advice unless someone asks it, and I don't condemn anyone for the decisions that they make.   I don't know if I'm a feminist or not.  I do think women are not less than men but I also believe women and men are unique and not interchangeable (one cannot replace the other).   

I read another comment that said this sub is only for women as described in my thread title.  Is that true?
