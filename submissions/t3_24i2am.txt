So I was talking to this new guy. Our majors came up in conversation, and after I told him I was going into Nursing, he says "Cool, yeah you'd make a cute nurse!" I get that he was trying to be nice but I couldn't help but feel like he was measuring my worth as a future nurse by how "good" I looked rather than my work ethic, interpersonal skills, and desire to help others. Really annoying. 

I replied, "I would rather be a damn good nurse than a cute nurse, but thanks I guess."

Anyone have similar experiences?
