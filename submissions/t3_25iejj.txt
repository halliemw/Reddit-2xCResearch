Why do men think that I ask for flirtatious comments because of what I wear? It makes no sense I wear what I want because I want to not because I'm looking for attention. I'm tired of being put into phrases that have nothing to do with how I feel only because of my apparel.

Sorry girls just my two cents on how I feel
