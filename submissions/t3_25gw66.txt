I'm sorry if this is really silly, but I'm looking for some suggestions. My hair (like a lot of people's I'm sure) gets fairly frizzy in the summer once the humidity has started up. I've always just sort of dealt with it, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to help with it? It can be anything from a product (mousse or something similar) to a technique while drying. Really just looking for something that's fairly simple and won't add too much onto my morning routine.
