So I've never posted here before and I'm not sure if this is the right place or not but I thought I'd give it a try. 


I am a 22F about to finish college. Since the start of my college career I had a boyfriend, we were together for 4 years basically. This past January he broke up with me citing he didn't feel the same anymore. Since then I have gone on multiple dates with different guys but have remained single. I am starting to worry that I'm not going to find someone that makes me feel the way my ex made me feel. Things just felt right with him, we like connected in a way that I've never connected with someone. I also was insanely attracted, I've never been this attracted to someone before he was my perfect guy.


Well as you can tell I really thought that after being together for so long and with our connection that we would end up together. But obviously with the break up thats not gonna happen.


Since the break up and dating multiple different guys I am starting to feel really self conscious and I am worrying that I will never find that real connection again. I know a SO is supposed to enhance your life and not make it, but I can't get rid of this voice in the back of my head telling me that if I never get married or find that guy then I won't be fulfilled in life. 


Do other people feel this way too or am I just alone here? I'm starting to feel like that unless I settle for less then I really want (as far as a traits I'm looking for a partner), I won't find anyone.
