Whilst IFF is a welcome addition to some, it's also a slight annoyance to others.

Thankfully there is a way to filter them out using the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).

Simply click on the cog wheel next to the preference and logout links, select "Settings Console", switch the tab to "Filters" and add "[IFF]" to the keywords box. (and click save)

Hopefully that was helpful to some.
