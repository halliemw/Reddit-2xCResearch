I've been on the Nuvaring since March and since then I've had a lot of trouble finishing with my boyfriend during sex. I never had a problem before this and it honestly makes me want to cry every time because I feel like a failure and because it takes a hit at his self esteem. Last night he asked me if I was still attracted to him :( I definitely still am but even though I get very close I don't actually finish anymore. I do finish when I'm by myself but it takes a while and I don't do it as often anymore. Has anyone else had this experience and is there anything I can do to improve the situation?
