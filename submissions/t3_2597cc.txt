Dear TwoX, 

I am in desperate need of help to find underwear that don't get eaten by my large derri√®re.  I'm pear shape with a small torso(underbust is 30") and my hips set very low and wide and my booty sticks out like a shelf in the back.  I think I want something like a boxer brief but for the ladies.  I have a few pairs of "boy shorts" style undies but they must be to small as they just slide right into a wedgie with 3 steps.  I can find briefs that cover my bum they have saggy fabric in the front from being to large. 


Any suggestions on where to look for full coverage, but still somewhat sexy looking, underwear?  Preferably cotton and not terribly expensive.  I'm in the US so places like Target, Kohls, Sears... Are easy to get to.  

Edited- I meant pear shape, not apple.
