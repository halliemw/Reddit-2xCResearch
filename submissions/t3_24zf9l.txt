Hello ladies. 

I recently began taking Sprintec (oral contraceptive). Every month I find myself worrying my period won't come even though I know the odds of pregnancy are so slim. I take my pill at the same time everyday and I have never missed a pill. My boyfriend and I use the pill and pull out together as our form of BC.

How long did it take you to trust your birth control?
