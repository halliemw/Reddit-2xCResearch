So I have been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life but am going through a really rough patch right now.  I finally reached out to get help and am doing all I can to get better, but right now that isn't much.  My friend, and roommate has been awesome at helping me but something came out at my doctor's appointment today that I have not told anyone about, ever.

I am pretty sure I was sexually abused by some teen-aged boys that lived in our townhouse complex when I was four or five years old.  It may have even involved my half brother(s).  I am not going to go into the details of the event, because I don't really even fully remember them, but I get flashbacks of that day.  The flashbacks started about ten years ago, and I was never sure about it, so I just kept pushing them back.

Anyways I want to tell my friend about this because he is my only support where I live right now.  He knows pretty much everything about me and wants to help me get better.  I want him to understand why I will be going to certain treatments or therapy or whatever.  (I am still waiting for the mental health intake program to schedule me for an intake appointment).  I also feel like this is something I need to start sharing so that I can start to accept it myself.  I am really reluctant to tell my parents because at this point there is nothing that can be done about what happened then and I don't want them to blame themselves for not protecting me.

Anyways, if you all have any advice about situations such as this or wouldn't mind sharing if you have been in a similar situation yourself I would love to hear what you have been doing to heal yourselves, and how you have handled telling the important people in your lives.

I love you all, in an internet way.
