Hi ladies! 

So the title pretty much says it all. To give you more details, I'm 24 years old and I think I'm pretty attractive, social, just pretty normal all around. A guy probably wouldn't assume that I'm a virgin. The truth is, the circumstances just haven't worked out for me to have had sex so far. I've been seeing this guy I met on OkCupid and I figure I should probably break the news to him before we actually sleep together (not saying we definitely will, but it has crossed my mind). I just don't want to scare him, or whoever I do eventually end up being intimate with, away, but I really am unsure of what the best way to go about it is. 

Also, if anyone has any general advice you wish you'd known for someone in my position, I'd greatly appreciate it!
