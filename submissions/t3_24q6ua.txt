Pretty sure it's just PMS, because I feel as though I go through this at least once a month/cycle. lol I feel like none of my attempts at improving my life have gotten me anywhere and I just end up back where I started. (And yeah, I know, I know, it's the journey not the destination... still doesn't help me feel less crappy when I wind back up at the start line.)  It sucks because a part of me truly believes I just want to throw everything away, my job, my unsatisfying relationships and maybe just drive for miles. Lose and re-find myself on a road trip as though my life is some kind of movie with a happy ending. Except I know that's not how real life works and sure as hell not my life. (I actually did try to start over by moving to a new city/state a couple of years ago... what's the other saying? You carry your baggage with you or whatever. Yep, that's what happened. booo)

*insert frustration sighs, grumbles and other noises*
