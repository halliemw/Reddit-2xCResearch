This is a bit of a rant, I apologize ahead of time. I was on my way into 7/11 and these teenaged boys on bikes threw magnum condoms at me RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY DAD. Here is the kicker, my dad didn't even notice. I didn't really know what to do so I didn't say anything but I kinda begged my dad to go in with me. He was completely oblivious to the condoms on the ground in front of me. He left me to go in alone and when I left they started yelling things like "Hey baby" and "how are you doing honey?". These kids had to be only a couple years younger than me, I'm only seventeen. What the hell makes people think they can do this kind of shit? I've had people honk at me and yell remarks at me before but not like this. It was so shocking... I'm guessing it was some sort of dare but it made me feel awful. They were laughing and yelling and everyone in the parking lot could hear them except my dad apparently. It was downright disrespectful and I was so shocked I did not do anything except stay silent and ignore them. Maybe I should have told them off, I don't know, but I certainly didn't want to address those little shits.  Sorry for the rant I'm just upset and weirded out that something like that actually happened to me. I'm sure you ladies have dealt with cat-calling before but has anyone had strangers do something like throw condoms at you before? Thank you for reading this if you are, I would very much appreciate some advice if ever another incident like this were to happen again!
