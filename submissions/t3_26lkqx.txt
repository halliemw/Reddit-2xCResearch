I went to visit a restaurant I used to work at to visit  some old coworkers, and one of the managers whom used to work with asked me if I was pregnant. I haven't gained weight and I'm really thin. If anyone else had asked this, I would have been confused,but this guy always asked me this and tried to grab my stomach. I asked him why he thought it was ok to ask me that and he shrugged. When I worked there, the men there would constantly joke that I was pregnant.

Has this ever happened? I'm still confused why they think this is ok, or funny.
