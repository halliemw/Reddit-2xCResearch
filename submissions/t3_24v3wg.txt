Hi girls!

This morning, I was searching Google for "porn with hot guys" and, like in a dream, Google shows me [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1xpxuv/where_can_i_find_porn_with_hot_guys_and_average/)

I was shocked, overjoyed, and excited to see that so many other women share this need to see porn that is made for US. A little about me... I'm 26, have been in the sex industry since I was 18. Some of the things I've done (if you care): been in a vanilla boy/girl porn, been in femdom porn, was a well-known camgirl with 15K Twitter followers (in 2009-2011), and am now a well-paid phone dominatrix in NYC. Due to my location, I have no problem scouting good-looking guys with big dicks, beards, and tattoos. I will be the creative side of the production process. A female friend of mine is in film and has access to a crew and equipment.

I am super excited to get this going, but first I'd like to know...

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE?!

Be as specific and filthy as possible, because you just might see it. The TwoX-ers who come up with the best ideas will be given the video for free when it's finished. We're looking to start production within the next month.

Ahhhh, I'm so excited :)))))


(And just so you know I'm a real person, here's my new [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yevgeniyaaa). You can stay in touch with me there about this project whenever you want and pitch ideas there too.)

**EDIT: LOVING the ideas so far! Please keep the momentum going :D Also - if you could add pics of the kinds of guys you want to see, that would be super helpful, since we all have our own definitions of 'hot'**

**EDIT 2: I see there is some concern over the whole not-into-Twitter thing. I will be updating you guys on the progress via this sub, since there is overwhelming interest in this project already. I've also gotten a couple of PMs from interested web developers and designers, so this thing is getting off the ground a lot quicker than I could've ever hoped!** 

**EDIT 3: Just...wow. My inbox is overflowing with offers of help, ideas, and talent. I am sitting here, bouncing up and down like Spongebob Squarepants on drugs. And now, I'm trying to think of a name for this thing. The only thing that comes to mind (and seems to fit) is "Post-Porn" - the age of pornography catered to the lowest common denominator is over. This is the post-porn age.**

**EDIT 4: I just purchased the domain! Stay tuned!**

**EDIT 5: Holy guacamole! This is still at #1!!! I'm determined to read every. single. comment. this morning and compile a list of the ideas I'm definitely going through with (which I anticipate being very, very long). A friend and I were discussing this project at length yesterday and we came up with the idea to hold casting 'events' at a couple of bars in Brooklyn. Only spots where the locals tend to hang out and very hot people are often seen. We're speaking to a bar manager next week about how to put this together tastefully.** 

**EDIT 6: I can't believe this is happening so fast! A couple of hours ago, I spoke to the owner of a hot new cafe in Brooklyn that's getting a bit of local press (more details later on) and we're planning on doing an invite-only get-together for people who are interested in participating. She's really excited about this, as it will also be *their* first event ever! There will be good food, good alcohol, and good times. We're aiming for the 3rd week of June, so hopefully I'll meet plenty of people who are into being on camera. If you're in the NYC area and would like to get on the list, shoot me a PM with your contact info! :)**

EDIT 7: Omg, how many more edits can this chick make?!, you must be wondering. :P Awesome person /u/Spongi created a subreddit for all of my updating needs! Those not into checking my Twitter (totally understandable since a lot of the shit I post is really stupid), can now go to /r/POSTPORN for all of their update needs! It's empty so far, but you all can fill it in until I have something new to tell you! I'm so excited, I'm fucking shaking. This is really happening! :))))
