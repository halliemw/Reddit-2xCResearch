I've noticed a lot of these posts here relate to sexism, body image, sexual assault, and a lot of the struggles women face. It's all really heavy stuff, so I think it'd be nice to have a post with a positive topic to break it up some.

Tell me what you love about being a girl. It could be as simple as loving how skirts swish, or something deeper. I want to hear it all.

Edit: will somebody please tell me why this is being downvoted into oblivion?
