Lately I've been feeling like anything with unnecessary fragrances gets a ton of hate. I happen to love fragranced stuff (I'm also lucky that I'm not sensitive to them). I also love perfumes and colognes although I rarely wear them because so many people can be sensitive to them. 

So tell me, what are your unpopular opinions or practices?
