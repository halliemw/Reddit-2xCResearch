Hey 2x, I've got an interesting one for you. Using a throwaway because blah blah blah. I'll try and keep this brief.

I'm 21F and attend a college that also caters to people with various levels of learning difficulty/special needs. 


Yesterday, I was sat in the computer area of the library when a lad (tricky to age, but probably between 18-25) with learning difficulties sat down next to me. He stared at me for a while before poking my bottom with one finger. It made me jump and turn towards him, when he said "hello!" loudly. I said "hello!" and he asked my name, which I told him, and he told me his. I said "nice to meet you," to which he responded by asking if I had a boyfriend.

I said yes, and then we carried on working silently. After about thirty seconds, he began stroking my hand (it was resting on the mouse). I said "okay!" in a kind of telling-off tone (I'm a trainee teacher, I'm mastering my stern voice!) and moved my hand. At this point, perhaps I should have moved but us Britons are terrified of offending anyone so I suppose I stayed put just out of politeness.

Not long after that, he rubbed my upper back. I sat forward, he dropped his hand away and I shook my head at him.
I have zero experience with people with learning difficulties so I had no idea how to handle this without being offensive or patronising. 

Again, we carried on working silently at our computers, although by this point I felt deeply uncomfortable and wasn't sure what to do and so
I was just pretending to do my work. I noticed him staring at me out of the corner of my eye. Then I noticed that he started masturbating through his trousers (as in, his hand was on the outside of his trousers).

 I completely panicked. I know that I should have got up immediately and told the nearest member of staff but I just froze. I can't explain it. I'm confident and assertive and have no problem telling a cat-caller to go f**k himself, but this was different. None of my friends were still at college so I fired an email over to a trusted teacher and asked if he was still around (this was after normal teaching hours). 

After I hit send, the boy reached over, slid his hand quickly across my thigh and grabbed my genitals. At which point I leapt up, shouted "NO!" And hurried over to the library supervisor. I whispered to her what had happened, tears in my eyes, and she initially **told me to just move computers**. After realising what she'd just said and seeing the look on my face, she got up and took the boy's name before asking him to leave.

He called over "sorry! Sorry! Sorry!" To me and I just nodded at him. I sat back down and the supervisor came over to talk to me and apologise for what happened. She took my name and said she would let the boy's tutor know, as he obviously needs to have some lessons in this kind of social interaction. I then sent my teacher (who had replied to say he was still at college) a quick email letting him know what happened.

I then left college and went straight home. I was shaken up and teary and confused.

How am I supposed to feel about this? There was a group of girls who saw the whole thing and laughed hysterically. Am I supposed to laugh this off and treat it as a sweet incident involving a misguided special needs kid with too many hormones to deal with? If I had been assaulted by someone without special needs in the library, it would seem more clear cut and I would be very angry at that person.
But I cannot be angry with this person. He is not 100% responsible for his actions. 

Any advice would be welcome! Am I overreacting?


**Edit**: oh and also, I went straight home instead of stopping off to vote in the general elections (UK). I'm getting loads of stick from my friends for not voting but I can't bring myself to tell them why. So here's a cyber-vote for Labour.
