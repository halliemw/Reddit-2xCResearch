I am debating on whether or not to continue watching the show. I am two episodes in. 

How much more of "the book" are we going to see after episode two?

Is the plot of sexual slavery continued throughout the show and season? This is the biggest issue for me as the topic and seeing it gives me incredible anxiety and panic attacks that can last for days. 

Are there any more rapes shown besides episode one?
