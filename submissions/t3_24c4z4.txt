Ladies, today we put to rest two brave souls lost to the Red War. To lose one is hard enough, but two in one day is simply tragic. 

We put to rest the blue and green Paisley Hanes, a younger lass who always was there to not show a panty line when the Thong Unit had been exhausted. The enemy came upon us swiftly and in the middle of a final. There was nothing she could do. She fought bravely. 

We also honor Watermelon Pink Hanes, with her colorful blue and green band. Getting on in her years and a little loose in the elastic, she should have been retired months ago. But alas, yet another surprise attack from the enemy brought her down. We had underestimated the heaviness of the onslaught, our battlements did not hold. She held off several waves, sacrificing herself in her ever-devoted mission to keep safe The Pants. 

Ladies, a moment of silence for our fallen soldiers.
