Some of us are angry about the switch to default status. I personally am unhappy because I think it's a bad idea, but angry because of how the mods handled the change.

Given that the mods had no time or leeway to consult the community, I understand why the change was made so abruptly. I still think it was handled very poorly and without attempts to broadly engage the community here (e.g. A statement of why the change, why no warning, if there's a trial period, and how the mods envision 2X functioning in the future). So here's what I would like to see:

- A public announcement of what the decision making process was for this change, and what the decision making process will be in evaluating whether to stay a default

- A decision making process regarding default status that involves the community not just the mod team (i.e. a poll, a stickier post where people can give feedback, etc)

- A timeline for assessing whether or not this is working for the sub - I'd like to see a revaluation in a week and then monthly or bimonthly after that, if 2X remains a default

Basically, I'd like to see things change so that I could trust that the mod team is actually listening and engaging the community here, not solely defending a decisions made without community input.

But that's one opinion. So, 2X community, what would **you** like to see?
