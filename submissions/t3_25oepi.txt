As a transexual women, the title /r/TwoXChromosomes offends me in the manner that it implies only women who were biologically born women. I, having an X and a Y chromosome but also a female feel that I am not represented by the community in this sub. Please do not mistake me for the people found on Tumblr, I do not support any crimes against any gender, I only want to be represented as a subscriber to this subreddit.
