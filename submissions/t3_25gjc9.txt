Using my throwaway for this...

So to start off I am 23F and in a very happy relationship with an amazing guy. We have been offically together for about 4 months but have been very close for about 10 months, and Ive known him for over 7 years.

The problem I have is that he is waiting until marriage to have sex. Now I admire him for this, the amount of resolve he has to keep his morals is amazing, but I feel bad because I cant keep my urges under control.

For example, if Ive had a bit too much to drink I accidently try to take advantage of him (and my inhibited sense of judgement) and try to get it on. Usually it ends up with him sternly keeping me at bay and me being an emotional wreck, crying and whatnot. And we all know that feeling of when things get heating up and common sense and decency get pushed aside. 

I dont think any of this would be a problem if my previous relationship wasnt so different. I was in a relationship for almost 7 years, he was my first (pretty much first for everything), and we became sexually active with each other pretty early on in the relationship. Because if the length of the relationship and the amount of commitment we had for each other, it wasnt rare to have sex more than once a day. (that relationship though is entirely over)

**So my question now is** how do I deal with myself? I want this relationship to work out so I dont want to compromise it just because of this one issue.

All questions and comments are welcome! Thanks for reading!
