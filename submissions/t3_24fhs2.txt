I went to comment on your topic, but it wouldn't let me because it was deleted and your account was deleted too. I just wanted to let you know that I don't necessarily think it's as grave as the other commenters made it seem! 

I have the same exact issue when I sleep in an unfamiliar/new bed in a new position when first dating a person. For example, after sleeping on my side in my own bed, by myself, in a very comfy position, for months as a single lady, my body gets used to that. Once I start dating someone new, and try to put my body in a snuggling position it's not used to sleeping in (especially in a bed it's not used to), I get sternum pain just like you described. After a few nights of habitually sleeping in this new way, my body gets used to it.

I would guess it's a similar thing with you. If so, just wait a few more nights to see if it gets better. However, if you've been sleeping this way with your partner in this bed habitually for a while and it's still occurring, then it may be something else, and it wouldn't hurt to see your doctor.

Good luck!
