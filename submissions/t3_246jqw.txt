I might be the laziest person ever. My house is a mess. I don't do anything active after work (just watching TV or browsing the internet) and I postpone everything that is slightly troublesome. This has, of course, let to a million problems. A lot of people have urged me to change on countless occasions. But I cannot find the motivation to do so. Do you know people who were super lazy and completely changed their life around? Can it be done?
