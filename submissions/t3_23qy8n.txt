Hey y'all, I'm 17 and going to the gyno for the first time this week (or next). Sexually active and subject to killer periods. I'm trying to figure out the best method of birth control--one that will:

1. Reduce my chances of getting pregnant during PIV sex (the boyfriend and I always use condoms but we want a hormonal method as well just to be sage
2. End the killer periods! I'm sick of missing school and lying in bed feeling miserable. 
3. Not interfere with my other meds (lamictal 200 mg, zoloft 25 mg, and clonidine--not to be confused with klonopin--for bipolar disorder/anxiety nos/sleep)
4. Something cheap. My family is pretty poor but we're fortunate enough to get halfway decent health insurance through my dad's employer (the state). 

Obviously I'll talk to the gynecologist about this and I've been doing thorough research on Planned Parenthood's site. But the My Method app they have isn't too helpful and I want to know more about what people's personal experiences. Also, a few other things:


* I worry about going on the pill because I'm fairly bad at remembering to take the meds I'm currently on, even with reminders and alarms 

* Implanon--the PP website says it doesn't work if you're on certain psych meds--anyone know about this (and obviously I'll consult the gyno and my shrink but just wanted some more info beforehand)? Blog post on Scarleteen said otherwise but didn't specify which meds. Also the insertion method kind of scares me. 

* Mirena: has anyone had an experience with this making their periods lighter? I like the idea of it lasting for five years and being relatively low maintenance. I'm worried about the up front costs and wondering if it will be cheaper than the pill over time. At 18 I think I'm off Dad's insurance? Not sure. 

* I'm very fortunate to have parents and a loving boyfriend who are supportive. Wanted to acknowledge that just 'cuz. 

Thanks so much. I know a lot of this depends on the person but I figured it wouldn't hurt to hear more about everything. I am kind of intimidated by the choice.
