I'm so embarrassed, I'm using a throwaway account. I know the obvious thing to do is GO TO THE DOCTOR but I can't until at the earliest Thursday so I'd rather get someone to tell me to calm down and it's not a big deal until then. Unless it's not??


Basically I went to shower and when I took off my underwear I saw a lot of brown, mucusy discharge. I have been on BC for over a year and am five days away from my scheduled period, I've never been early and I'm typically a day or two late if anything. I DID forget to take my pill on Friday though, so I took it on Saturday night with my Saturday pill.

So, it's not post-period dried blood. It doesn't look like blood and it doesn't smell like blood, it doesn't really have a smell at all. The consistency is normal, but the color is not. 

I also could not be pregnant unless I'm like five weeks pregnant, as that was the last time I had sex and I've had my period between having sex and now. Also, I always use condoms. I was tested in August and have been with one partner who was also tested and clean (and monogamous). He is my only sexual relationship.


What could this be?? I've never had brown discharge before my period. And if I'm on BC, why would I be so early? I don't have anyone I can go to about these embarrassing things, so I really appreciate any advice. Also, I'm trying NOT to google because then I'll think I have vagina cancer.
