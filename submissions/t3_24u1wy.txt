Ok, so my lil sis is very active in school choir, show choir and theater. So I typically go see her performances but there are some times that I just don't want to go. However if I say that I'd rather not go or I I have something else planned I'm immediately the bad guy and my lil sis hates me. I don't think I should have to sit through every performance. 

Also I should admit that I am jealous of her. My parents go to every performance but hardly went to my band concerts. (And if they did they complained about it) . I do love my sister. 

Am I wrong for not wanting to go? How should I handle this? 

Tl;dr I'm probably gonna end up going
