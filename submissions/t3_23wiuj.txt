I'm a female in the Marine Corps and constantly have to deal with bullshit stigmas like I can't be a decent mechanic because I have boobs or it's automatically assumed that I'm a whore. It's become second nature to brush it all off but I do get sick of it. Where else are y'all forced to put up with stuff like this?
