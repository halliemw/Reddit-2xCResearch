One thing I notice on here and from talking to other women in real life is that I've never been in a dangerous situation before. I come from a middle-class family and I have rarely been alone out in public. I don't even drive myself places. I'm a twenty-three year-old college student, so I kind of sheltered myself needlessly. I've only ever been alone with one guy friend in a room before, and that was usually only for ten or twenty minutes with my parents or friends in the next room.

I want to put myself out there a bit more. Learn to drive. Go out. Be alone in public. I'm ugly, so I don't get cat calls, but I'm still short and gullible, so I know I'm a rather easy target for other crimes, and I actually now live in a dangerous town. I'm not about to go do something obviously dangerous, but I don't think I'd recognize the grey line until I crossed it.

For those who have been in dangerous situations or avoided them, what should I look out for?
