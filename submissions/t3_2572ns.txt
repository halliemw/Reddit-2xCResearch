I go on a lot of feminist subreddits as well as men's rights subreddits. I read the comments that are almost always fighting and shitting on each other. Men and women acting like only one sex can thrive in this world. Beating the hell out of each other. It makes me sad mostly. I don't know why I keep reading it. I guess it beats reading about /r/conspiratard and /r/conspiracy fighting. 

Anyway, I'm meandering a bit here. What I came to say is this. This is a really great womens subreddit (at least from my admittedly limited perspective on such issues) It seems very supportive and friendly. I don't see anything shaming women who are the wrong race or body size or sexual orientation. Your posts are varied and interesting and it feels like this sub has scope. It takes a larger picture of the world and brings certain aspects into focus. It does all that and doesn't make me feel like a piece of shit just because I was born with penis, which is nice.

I know there has been drama here recently with becoming a default sub and I read the supposed gross out posts that people, correctly or incorrectly, thought were there to drive away new male visitors and as a honestly if reading about a woman's period is so traumatic for someone that they unsub, well they probably weren't mature enough to handle talking to you in a reasonable fashion and the sub will be better without them. I'm 30 years old and I stopped being grossed out by periods around the time I got my drivers license. 

Me personally I will be subscribing. Don't worry, I'll keep my comments to myself. I know this isn't a place where my voice needs to be heard and I will respect that and stick to read only behavior. I only made this post because, well I'll just say that today has been hard here in my real life. I found myself missing my mother pretty badly today. I needed cheered up and coming here and seeing your nice subreddit did that for me. So I'll just say thank you and take my leave. :-)
