My doctor has suggested that I go on birth control and has given me a sample of 2 months worth of Aleese. I am afraid to go on birth control. My doctor claims that all side effects are extremely rare and unlikely. 
I have heard that birth control affects who you are attracted to, and I am terrified that it will make me less attracted to my boyfriend. I am also afraid that it will mess up natural lubrication and that it will give me saggy boobs if I go off it.  (I heard birth control makes your boobs shrink to a smaller cup than they were prior to going on it, and that it gives them stretch marks and makes them sag)

my sister told me that birth control made her feel less attracted to her boyfriend. I feel extremely conflicted as my periods get so heavy that I need to use super absorbency tampons, and I need to change them and a pad every 90 minutes or I soak through my clothes. 

for those who may be wondering, here is a link to the study that has made me concerned about how the pill could affect my relatioship

can anyone here offer opinions on these concerns and if they have happened to them or anyone they know?
