I'm 36 and I have never missed a period. Not since I was 13. Unless I'm on an airplane the day my period is supposed to start, you can set your watch by my regularity. I've also never been pregnant thanks to endo. So my periods have marched steadily for 23 years without missing a beat.

My period is five days late. It never came and doesn't seem it's going to. I've taken several pregnancy tests, all negative. But having never missed a period in my life, this is freaking me out just a little.

Is it possible that I'm pre-menopausal at my age? I honestly don't know a lot about menopause and what to expect. Is missing periods something that can start happening in your late 30's? 

Older ladies - help me figure out whether this is normal and what to expect moving forward!
