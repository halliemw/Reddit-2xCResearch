Hi all - I am six weeks into starting zoloft for anxiety and also two weeks away from tapering off of xanax completely.  I also use lo loestrin for birth control (about a year now on this).

Does anyone have any experience with these effecting your period?  I don't usually get my period outside of the usual nonhormonal pills at the end of each month - it happened once when I had forgotten to take a pill.  This month I started bleeding a week early, even though I've taken all BCP at the regular time.  The only difference has been the SSRI and benzo.
