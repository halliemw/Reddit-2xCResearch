I have a small buisiness in Norway, where I rent out everything from  chaffeurs to custom cars/busses for the celebration of [Russefeiring] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russefeiring). And I like wearing buisiness clothes that make me feel good, comfortable, and looks good, but I have to search long and hard for business clothing for women that aren't shit, or I have to buy Stella Mccartney suits, that cost a shit ton. Most of the stuff I see are weird blazers and pants with flares, shirts that fit weird around the breast area etc etc. 

And I got in touch with some people I know that work in the fashion industry, and we got talking about it, and we might start a online shop if there is intrest from people. We are thinking that the blazers, trousers and shirts will be designed by us, but the gowns and coats will be bought ( not sure yet) 
( You'll also have the oppurtunity to send us your mesurments and get them tailored) 

- If I were to give the shop a personality that fit it, it would be Claire from House if cards,  Rachel from Suits, Christina from House of Cards. [Scarlett johanssons balzer and trousers here](http://marieclaire.media.ipcdigital.co.uk/11116/00007dcaa/e5a9_orh100000w440/scarlett-johansson-red-suit.jpg) Do you get the idea? 
I would apriciate any tips. If I'm the only one with this problem, please tell me where you buy your stuff. 

I apologize beforehand for any grammatical and other errors, I'm on my phone.
