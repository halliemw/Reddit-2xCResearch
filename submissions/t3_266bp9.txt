I'm using a throwaway because this could involve details about my career. 

I'm a young lady-lawyer in a big city, and my job involves networking and socializing with other attorneys, clients, and potential clients (who are overwhelmingly older men).  I'm in a serious relationship but I don't wear a ring.  I'm learning that some people interpret my lack-of-ring status and inclination for chatty sarcasm as an opening for (unwelcome) flirtation.  And I'm worried that the fact men try to flirt with me might reflect poorly on me in the eyes of other people (my boss, coworkers, clients).  

So my questions for you are:  How do you deal with unwanted  advances from people you encounter in your career?  How do you deal with coworkers who observe those encounters?  And is there a way to harness these powers for good?
