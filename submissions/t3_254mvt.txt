I have very large inner labia. When  I was younger, I believed that I had destroyed myself by using the shower head to masturbate and thought I would forever be a freak. I hate my vagina. I feel so ugly and I don't think I can live with this much longer. Its not just an appearance issue either. I'm constantly having to adjust and tuck them back so they don't get caught between my thighs and pull. I can't be comfortable in half the clothing I wear. my sex life is shit. my boyfriend and I have been together for four years and he hardly ever goes down there. not because he doesn't want to but because I have made a point to just steer him away from it. 
   Sex is also sometimes very painful. If i have too much or if we go at it too long my labia swell up to a crazy size and I cant do much of anything but cry. Ive been to the gyno and she says it happens and to just keep lubricated but how much lube can one girl use before shes slipping off the bed?? lol. 
 We're in an open relationship (we're both bisexual so we can see other people of the same sex) But when I am presented with sexual activities with a woman I some how get in my bed I never take my pants off. I just please her and let her touch my breasts. one time I did take off my pants and she told me I was beautiful when I tried to explain what was going on down there. she said everyones different but I was SO uncomfortable the whole time. Ive talked with my boyfriend about possibly getting surgery to just make it go away. what I wouldn't give to be able to put on a pair of underwear and not have to adjust because my labia was poking out the side and hurting me. 
This is a giant wall of text and i'm sorry I just wanted to talk and now I'm crying and blah blah thanks for letting me lean on your shoulder for a minute while I tie my dignity back up  



TDLR long labia and a fucking sad case of poor me's
