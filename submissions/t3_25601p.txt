Between my last 2 periods I was feeling sick in the mornings and most evenings, peeing a lot, and I was spotting. I took a pregnancy test which came back negative. Then this week I had my period which was heavier than usual, had loads of clots, and I had worse cramps than usual. Any idea why this happened? Is it likely to be a one-off or will this happen again? I've been on the pill for 4 years and have never had a problem with it. After my period this week, everything seems normal at the moment.
