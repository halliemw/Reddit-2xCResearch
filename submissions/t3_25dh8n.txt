So obvs emotions are high and hormones are doing damage but just before your period your judgements and opinions can be slightly off and sometimes irrational... But if we know these are irrational... Then how come we can't stop thinking this way until our bodies sort themselves out! It's so frustrating seeing the flaws in your own thought processes but still feeling the same! It's like knowing what your thinking isn't really usually you... And there's nothing you can do about it... Making you even more frustrated! Are these thoughts generally unclear or is this actually me, the overly critical, over thinking pessimist?
