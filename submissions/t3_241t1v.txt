I have problems with negative/distorted thinking and I'm wondering if someone can tell it to me straight?  



To make a very long story short, my twenties have been disappointing so far because of an unfortunate combination of serious illness that happened at inconvenient times, which really set be behind in my education/career/life advancement.  BUT it's important to make the best of the situation in order to be happy in life! Still, I have trouble with it sometimes.   


I'm finally at a place where I am kind of happy and healthy.  I've been applying for jobs in my fave city - not only does it fit with the way I would like to live my life, but the industry I work in is kind of booming there.  But sometimes I catch myself thinking "I'm 29.  What's the point of moving out of my home town at this point? I'm just going to be old starting from now, and life will be less and less fun.  What's the point of living in your dream city if you aren't young, glamorous, and vibrant?"


I wonder if this is true, or is it more of my distorted thinking?  People are happy and have fun at any age, no? Furthermore, 30 isn't old, I don't think.  Also, I am not convinced that everyone has an ideal life in the first place - it's just that the media only portrays young people being glamorous and over achieving etc.
