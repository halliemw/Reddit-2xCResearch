I have no clue where to post this. I'm fairly new to reddit.

I'll type out my question and maybe you guys can point me in the right direction. 

On 4/21 my ex lured me to his apartment and raped me. Looking back at the messages earlier that day it seemed like it was premeditated. I went to the cops (a few days late... I was scared) and got a case and my phone messages/call logs copied for them. I also went to the hospital to get bruises photographed, poked, swabbed, and drugged up with antibiotics. I went in again later that week and gave them copies of messages from my facebook. He logged onto my daughters account since I had all of his accounts blocked and in those messages it states him raping me and his craziness... when I block accounts he makes new ones to message me. He's showed up at my work and home unannounced.  

My problem is it's been over a week and I haven't heard anything from the cop, detective, lawyers, anyone, about anything. I've gone in left papers, called and left messages, and in the meantime my ex is messaging me and driving around free and starting up a new relationship with another girl. He got a new car and new tv, and is living his life while I'm stuck being afraid every little noise is him coming for me. 

Who do I need to talk to to get him arrested? How long does an investigation of rape take when there's messages about how he's raped me? I can't live with him free to pop by at any time... Im at work alone a lot and there's no way anyone else can be scheduled with me.
