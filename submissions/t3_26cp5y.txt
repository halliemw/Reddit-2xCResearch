My partner and I have been together 4 years and usually have an excellent relationship. Can I just say I don't know for sure if I'm pregnant. But I am planning on taking a test soon...

I decided to come off the pill a while back due to loss of libido. I spoke to my partner about it before and said I'd be more than okay with a 'happy accident' and if he wasn't up for this then it was up to him to use our condom stock. Well...He didn't take me up on that offer so we've had sex as normal without any contraception. So to me this means he's okay with the idea I may get pregnant.

So I'm late... I spoke to him briefly about maybe taking a test of nothing happens over the next few days and he's told me that he doesn't think we could afford/look after a baby right now.

I'm really hurt as 12 months ago I was also late and he told me he thought I should get an abortion. It's just mixed signals all the time. He always talks about 'when we have kids'  discusses baby names and things he wants to teach our child, then goes and says this when there's a possibility. 

For the record I would not get an abortion. I'd rather chuck his uncommitted Arse out the door, but it makes me feel ashamed that we had unprotected sex when I told him in the beginning the ball is in his court!

What do I do? Even if I'm not pregnant this is gonna cause problems.
