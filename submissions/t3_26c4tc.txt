Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So when I [22F] was about four or five I was molested by a ride attendant when I got lost at a theme park. Charges were never pressed because I didn't even realize what had happened to me until I was much, much older (about fourteen/fifteen). I've only told two people about it, my best friend and my ex-boyfriend.

So I met this amazing, awesome guy at college this January. Let's call him Jared. Jared and I clicked immediately, but because I had a boyfriend, we became fast friends and drinking buddies. We did a lot of stuff together and eventually I began to develop feelings for him. I broke up with my boyfriend (for various other reasons not pertaining to Jared), and now Jared and I have been dating for a while.

I am seriously crushing on this guy and I can see the potential for a long, long relationship with him. I told my last boyfriend about it when we were both quite drunk and he was very accepting and loving. 

I'd just like your advice, ladies. The only two times I've told people in person about this was when I was hammered. Should I continue this trend? It seems a lot easier to talk about it when I'm not sober. How should I even bring it up? It doesn't seem like the kind of thing you can just throw into conversation.

Thanks.
