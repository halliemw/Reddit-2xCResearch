Hey twox! I am 22 years old and was on the pill for about 7 years before coming off in August last year. I had one withdrawal period in September and then one more period about 2.5 months later in November. It has now been 5 months since my last period.

I am having regular sex with my boyfriend but we use condoms and the diaphragm every time. I have also done quite a few pregnancy tests in the past 5 months so I'm relatively sure I'm not pregnant.

Other related health things:
- I did change my diet (paleoish - mostly wheat, dairy and soy free now) at around the same time that I went off the pill. 
- I have also noticed an increase in deep sore acne around my jaw line (I had pretty good skin on the pill). 
- I have been trying to lose a little weight (I'm 5"3', was 70kgs, currently 67kgs, would like to be 60kgs) but I eat a lot.

Just wanted to see if anyone else had something similar happen to them after stopping the pill. I'm planning on seeing a hormone specialist soon. Thanks! :)
