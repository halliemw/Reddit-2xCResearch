For the third time in the year that I've been working at my current job, someone asked my boss "is that your daughter?" When they saw us together.... Curious if this has happened to anyone else and how you would react? 

The people who have asked have all been other employees. I work for a large organization so we are constantly going to meetings with people from other departments that I have never met, and she might see only once a year. But why would they assume that I am her daughter?? It's just such an awkward situation every time it comes up. 

I honestly cannot see someone asking a man "is that your son?" When he walks into a meeting with a younger employee. 

Just to clarify, we really don't look anything alike. We are both white, but that's about it. Different hair and eye colors, and I also have curly hair while she has very straight hair. 

Is there a way to let people know that's kind of an offensive/inappropriate question to ask in an office?
