I did Google this question but it doesn't seem like the common answers apply to me. Top two possibilities are digestive problems (not a problem I'm having) and cysts (was just at my gyno and I would imagine she would feel that?). Also it's not really super painful just mildy. It mostly just feels weird, like a twitching eye.

I've never ever felt this before in my life and it happened twice in the last 30 minutes. I'm on BC and my husband cums outside of me, but nothing is foolproof and I'm not really super consistent with my BC. I have forgotten to take it here and there. My "period" is supposed to start in about 5 days so I guess I'll find out then. Just wondering if anyone has ever felt this before and if they found out what caused it. 

Not a bad thing if it's a pregnancy, it would be my first, but I'm not exactly hoping for that right now lol.
