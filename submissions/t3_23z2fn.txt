I've been on various kinds of hormonal birth control for ~5 years, and while I really like the predictability and shortened length of my periods, it does make me feel asexual quite a bit of the time. I have been in a relationship with my current boyfriend for about 1.5 years, and we have really great sex! He is super attracted to me and loves touching me even if we're not in bed. However, my natural inclination to have sex is just not there. At all. And sometimes, I feel almost *annoyed* by him giving me physical attention because that is just not where my mind is. I feel so bad for feeling this way. I don't think that he has noticed (we do end up having great sex once we get started). What can I do!?
