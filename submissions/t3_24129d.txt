Well, actually, I have two conflicting opinions from two different physicians about my HPV status. I'll explain. 

My ex boyfriend had a genital wart apparently before we met. He informed me of this, and had been treated and had no symptoms by the time we were dating. I also was fully vaccinated with Gardasil, and my doctor told me that my odds of contracting warts was basically nil. 

 One year after breaking up with my then boyfriend, I notice a tiny, tiny bump on my labia that I saw dermatologist twice about. She examined me thoroughly and said that it was not HPV (a wart) and to calm down. 

The tiny bump disappeared in a week, but before then I had taken a photo of it. When I went in for my annual exam with my gynecologist, I showed him the photo and he said it was HPV. He then examined me and said that yep, it was gone, but he still maintains it was "probably" HPV because of my history with my ex. 

There is nothing there to take a biopsy now. It's driving me crazy. I've been with my current boyfriend for over a year and he has no signs of anything. I feel terrible about this, and bad about myself. Any advice? What did I do? I can't get clarity with a diagnosis.
