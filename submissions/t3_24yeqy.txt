I have been working at an inner city school since September and just got a job at another one for next school year as a Chemistry teacher. The school is one of the better schools in the city and not very dangerous.

My boyfriend and I basically had the longest talk about how I should apply to suburban schools because he is so scared of me working in the city schools. He says they are not safe and the demographics just make him feel worse (the students are mostly African American). 

I don't know what to do. I understand his point, but we've talked about this and he only brought his feelings up now when I just got the actual job. The program I am in is a special one in which teachers would get scholarships and greatly discounted college tuition if we agreed to work in the inner city schools. The money has not gone through and it is not imperative that we work in the city because no contracts were signed. 

Any advice on what to do or what to say to my boyfriend?
