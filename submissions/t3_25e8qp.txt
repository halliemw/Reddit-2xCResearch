The two biggest issues:

1. I'm like 90% broken up with my boyfriend, but he definitely is still in the picture. No, I'm not going to cheat on him physically, but I already feel like I'm cheating by having endless thoughts about this man (er, Fred?) 

2. I hate my father. He's a manipulative, selfish, arrogant dickhead. Read into that all you'd like, I'm like a gorram textbook. 

I have hooked up with this man once already, about 2 years ago (before the boyfriend), and we are going camping with some friend (who know), thus the opportunity is presenting itself.
