This is sorta complicated, but basically my ex-boyfriend and I have a history where we've tried being friends, FWB, then friends again, and whatever. Last month I explicitly told him that we weren't going to have sex ever again. The next time I saw him and we hung out, he spent most of the time asking me over and over and over to make out with him/have sex. I told him no each time, until finally I caved in. 

He's actually done this many times, where I'll say no and he'll keep asking until finally I just give in. But each time I feel really reluctant/uncomfortable/gross afterward. I'm trying to figure out, in my own head, whether I should be angry at myself for caving in (which is weirdish because I cave in because I feel guilty for saying no), or if I'm just overreacting, or what.

I guess my question is, if someone consistently badgers you by asking you to have sex with them over and over, how would you define that experience consent-wise (from a moral, not legal standpoint)?
