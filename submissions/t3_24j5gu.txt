I've been using one brand or another of birth control pill for about 4 years now.  

The first one I used for a couple years killed my sex drive.  I switched last summer, and that issue is better, but I feel like my acne and mood swings are way worse on this one.  Now when I PMS, I get so irritated and even straight up angry, it's ridiculous.  I also feel like my mood throughout my cycle and even throughout individual days fluctuates like crazy - going from perfectly content and happy to crushed and disgusted with myself and then back again just like that.

Soon after I switched to this new BC, I moved to a new city and started graduate school, so maybe stress and a new environment has something to do with these symptoms, but I can't really isolate the variables.  I've also been dealing with (self-diagnosed) depression/low self-esteem for a while now.

I just want to be in control of my emotions again!  I don't know which of my emotions are real and which are affected/caused by my medicine.  I feel like I don't know who I really am.

So, does anyone else feel like their BC affects their mood this much?  Does switching to a different brand/formula help?  I am a bit tired of shopping around though and want to give it up entirely.  How long does it take for your body to stabilize after stopping the pill?  I am going to study abroad for 7 weeks this summer.  If I decide to stop taking the pill, should I wait until I am back home?

Thank you for reading my ramblings, and I appreciate any advice you may have.

TL;DR: birth control affecting my mood too much (?); looking for advice/similar experiences.
