I created a new account for this and another post. I am mostly honest with my friends, but I feel this would never happen to them, so I am coming to y'all with this nervous confession!

I recently had a guy come inside me after the condom broke. He told me after sex finished. I checked my ovulation cycle on my phone app and decided I was in the clear, since it was a week after ovulation. Why oh why didn't I take emergency contraceptive? I have been keeping track of my period and it has been exactly a 28 day cycle for the past few months. Until now. I'm FIVE days late! Whew. I was so freaked today that I was way too hydrated and peed clear all day which didn't allow for a proper pee test. Am trying again in the morning because that's the best time to test for the pregnancy hormone. Wish me luck. I am 25 years old, relatively responsible, and feel upset with myself for allowing this to happen. Haven't told the guy yet til I know the results, so I am venting to y'all. Love all the support we give one another in this community. Alright. Good vibes. Good night! I'll update you in the morning!



UPDATE: well, the test was negative. So that's good, so now idk what to think. Should I keep taking a test each day til I start my period? It's too hard to just wait around!!
