Hi lovely people of TwoX,

I have a tendency to ramble, and I don't want to bore anyone so I'll try and make this as concise as possible. 

I guess my biggest issue right now is my body image, overall it's just miserable. I've found it hard to look at myself in the mirror for the past few years and honestly it just keeps getting worse. I can acknowledge I'm not the ugliest person in the world, but I am still by no means attractive. I actually dabbled with the idea that I was asexual for a while, before realizing that it wasn't that didn't have an sexual/romantic attraction for boys, just that I found myself so unattractive I couldn't fathom the idea of anyone being attracted to me, that it didn't seem worth the effort. **(Has anyone else ever felt like this? I've never told anyone that because I know it sounds ridiculous)** Like, the possibility of me finding someone seems so ludicrous to me that I've just given up on romantic feelings entirely. 

I know that's pathetic, and I know it seems like right now I'm looking for someone to throw me a compliment to save me from my sea of sorrow, but I don't know who else to turn to. My friends are all beautiful and out-going, and at this point in my life I just don't feel like I can keep up with them, and I guess that's hard to. I want to go out, and meet boys, and do stupid things but honestly most days I don't want to leave the house because I feel so *ugly*. 

I know I'm being dramatic and I know, I know, I shouldn't place all of my self-worth in something so superficial but the fact of the matter is I'm 19 and I just feel like I'm missing out. 

Thanks for reading, lots of love xx
