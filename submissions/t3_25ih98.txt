I "stole" the one I was supposed to take from my next pack, but that one was my last pack, and I need a consult before I can get anymore packs, BUT my work schedule will not allow me to go in for that consult until the end of my next and last pack. 

I really don't think it's a good idea to skip out on taking it and to just start my period a day earlier. I do not want to skip any pills. 

My local PP doesn't carry my pill anymore, so they had to write me an RX because I didn't want to switch-so it's not like I can call them and ask for a sample pack to even my packs back out...

Ugh, I don't even know what to do. Should I just call PP in the morning and tell them what happened and that I can't go in for an appointment due to time constrictions? They already extended my RX by one, so I doubt they'd do it again...
