**UPDATE: Thank you guys so much for all your responses and well wishes! Replying helped keep me distracted and it was nice to talk openly :) I ended up just using an icepack last night to play it safe and it definitely gave me some temporary relief. I just called my doctor's office and they squeezed me in for an appointment at 11:20 PST, which is in 3 hours. I'll update with more information when I find out.**

**UPDATE #2: Hey gals. Just got home from the doctor. He said it's almost definitely a full-blown can't really get worse yeast infection (he said he couldn't test for sure because of my period). I just picked up all my prescriptions. I got a tube of terconazole, ciprofloxacin (he started a culture of my urine because it looks like I may have a UTI as well), and some more 200mg tabs of phenazopyridine. He said because I'm so swollen and the infection is so bad that the peeling is akin a diaper rash but can absolutely happen with a yeast infection. So here's hoping for a quick recovery!! :(**

Hi 2X. This is my first time posting here (I'm pretty shy and don't post to reddit very much) because I'm in desperate need of some help. I don't really have many lady figures in my life, and none that I'm comfortable talking with about this kinda stuff. I hope this subreddit is ok to post this in. If you know of a better one, I would be happy to be directed there!!

I'm not really looking for medical advice per se because I'm going to do my best to get to the doctor's tomorrow but I really need some advice to try and get some temporary relief. Maybe some TMI ahead.

To start off I am 20 y/o and I am sexually active with my boyfriend of two years. The last time we had sex was about two weeks ago. This week I had some pain while urinating and suspected a UTI. I took some phenozopyridine because I've been a bit too busy and knew I would be able to get to the doctor Friday if symptoms persisted. Then I started getting yeast infection symptoms (itchiness, swelling, redness and dryness, which I experienced with my first yeast infection.)

Yesterday, I took an extra prescribed diflucan pill from my last yeast infection. And today things went really, really south. As if it wasn't bad enough with all the other symptoms, I started my period. I am using a tampon because the thought of a pad was even more painful with being so dry. I'm not sure if the tampon might make things worse either.

Then, tonight, I go to the bathroom to change and clean up and realized something horrifying. Skin is peeling from from my labia minora, my clit and my hood. I am in so much pain and itchy and swollen and I'm so desperate for relief. I tried miconazole cream but only had relief for about 10 minutes. 

I am tearing up right now because I'm just so uncomfortable and I don't know what to do to help myself until tomorrow. Can I use an icepack or would that make things worse? Is there some mystery home remedy I haven't heard of that I might be able to do?

**TL;DR: possible infection, don't know what it is, skin is peeling off my clit and labia and I don't know how to relieve the pain and itching until I can see the doctor tomorrow. Please help if you know anything that might help!!! :(**
