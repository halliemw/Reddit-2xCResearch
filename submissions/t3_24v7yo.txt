Okay, so about a year ago I met an amazing dude on reddit. We met on his country's subreddit because I'm moving there. 

Anyway, I'm afraid to meet him though I desperately want to. Up until a few years ago, I was a high school athlete and in formidable physical fitness well into my college years. Then... crippling depression hit and I gained something like 60 pounds, which is a lot on my frame. I'm not a land whale by any means, but going from a size 8 to 16 is jarring and even though I am still very proportionate and did maintain my muscle mass, I just... I hate the way I look. My measurements are 41-32-44. I'm so ashamed of my body now. I used to be muscular, lithe and strong and now I'm just sad. 

I knew I probably shouldn't keep talking to him because I didn't want him to get involved with me knowing I would never want to meet up, but we did. And we Skyped, and sent pictures and stuff. And he's gorgeous. Tall and super fit and just... amazing. He's like a 10. I used to be comparably attractive but now for the past three years I just feel invisible and my self esteem is at an all time low.

I know he has feelings for me but I am terrified of meeting him and I am contemplating just never meeting him at all, despite the fact that I'm going to end up about a half hour away from him after I move. 

I keep buying clothes in my smaller size, but I just don't have the motivation to lose weight. I'm still depressed sometimes. I was supposed to meet him in December 2013, then March 2014, then June and now I've just moved my move back to September 2014 in fear that he'll see me and I'll disappoint him horribly. This is really affecting me.

I have four months to make a change, I guess. I just don't feel healthy and I need to do it for that too.
