There are many people who feel like they were born in the wrong body and chose to identify with the gender they feel they should have been. However, it is impossible to change a person's karyotype, a person can have XY in their genome but identify as women and should be respected. Conversely, there are people who do have XX in their genome but identify as male. Is the subreddit name "TwoXChromosomes" not a blatant exclusion of those who have XY in their gene but identify a women?
