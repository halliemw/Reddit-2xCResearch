1 year post-op.

You might be able to guess which nipple I hate more. Actually, it's hard to even call them 'nipples' because they just look like........... not that.

There's hair there, I'm aware, sorry. The hair isn't as off-putting as the scars and marks, anyway, which is what I came here to discuss. There's also gunk that I haven't taken out because I'm wondering if I should just leave it for a chance of any healing even though it's been a year.

Is there any hope in 'fixing' them? I am extremely wary about seeing a PS yet again (as well as out of money). Thanks, all.

edit: For clarity -- the lines *around* the aerola are compression from my clothing. I'm concerned about the lines on the nipples themselves. It's especially bad on the right nipple (3rd and 4th pictures), where it looks like someone carved across them... because someone did, of course. I wouldn't have done it if I knew I'd have noticeable scarring. Wondering if anything can help.
