I'm so sad. She wasn't that close to me, but her brother and I are very close. She was so talented in music, kindness, art, and she lost at beating her drug problem. She died 2 weeks ago. Her brother called the next day, but I didn't answer because I didn't feel like talking. I don't go on Facebook much so I didn't find out (we don't live in the same state) until I happened to be talking to one of my girlfriends and my friend Collin also called. My girlfriend said you should answer you know Lauren died right? My heart dropped. She was so young. 

I know it's wrong to cope like this, but I'm drinking. I haven't eaten in 2 days. I slept all day today. I'm fucking heartbroken for her. Drugs were such a struggle for her. She shot up cocaine. Last year she was in the hospital for a month and had heart surgery for endocarditis. She was doing so great after that. She was a teacher. Smart and really kind. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone, but underneath there was a sadness.

Then I feel worse because when Collin called I blurted out Lauren's dead? Why didn't you tell me? He said I tried to call you. Now I just feel like an asshole. A sad angry asshole
