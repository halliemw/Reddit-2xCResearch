Let's face it.  Women are the minority here on reddit and making 2XC a default sub is bound to change things.  One of the issues we will face is that a lot of commenters on this sub will now be male, providing a male perspective on women's issues.  Personally, I like to keep my participation in reddit gender neutral.  However, since I usually come to this sub for a woman's perspective, knowing the gender of a commenter might be useful.  

Other gender-related subreddits (e.g. AskWomen) have the option for a gender flair?  Would this be a good idea for 2XC?
