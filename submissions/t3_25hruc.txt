So, I'm 30 and unmarried....and I'm just wondering where I went wrong.  Sometimes, I read the forums over at the red pill, and I want to believe that they're all misogynistic jerks....but there's part of me....that thinks that they're right.  That men only want young women.  That I'm never going to find anyone because I'm over the hill (even though I'm still attractive and in shape).  Here's the thing, though-I'm not the 30 year old who was *so focused on degrees and career* (I have my master's, but it's not my life), nor have I slept around tons a la sex and the city.  I feel like there's this animosity towards us 30 plus single women...like all of us rejected tons of good guys.  Not true in my case.  It just hasn't worked out for me.  My philosophy has sort of been, it'll happen when it's supposed to happen...most of the happy couples that I know met naturally, not when they were trying...but now I'm torturing myself and wondering if I should have made more of a concerted effort when I was younger? Also, I'm 6'3"; maybe that has something to do with it? I just feel like, at this age, I'm never going to meet anyone.  And being in love with someone who loves me back has been the one thing that I've desperately wanted in life. 
TL:DR-30 and single.  Wondering what I did wrong.  Wondering if I should just give up hope.
