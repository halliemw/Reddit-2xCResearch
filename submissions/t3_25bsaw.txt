Last Saturday my husband committed suicide.  He was 32 years old.  I am completely lost.  He was my whole life and we had been together since I was 18 years old.  I feel like my life has been taken from me in an instant.

I am not sure why I am writing this, I just so lost and confused right now.  Anyone else know how to pick up the pieces of a shattered life and try to move on?

EDIT:  Thank you everyone for sharing stories and understanding, as well as the suggestions for help and moving on.  I never expected this to get this much attention.  To give a little more information, my husband had struggled with depression and anxiety for most of his life.  He was taking medication for both as well as seeing a counselor.  But, he did not do this because of the depression.  He was on some kind of drugs at the time (uncertain at this time exactly what), but he was not himself when I got home that evening, he talked like he was in a different world all together.  I called his parents to our house for help in getting him to the hospital.  My mom also came to help.  We called 911, but when they got there they were not very understanding and unsure of what we wanted their help with, so I told them, he is not himself, he needs to see a doctor.  Finally, he said that he would come with the paramedics, so we all walked out of the bedroom (me, two paramedics, and a cop) when he slammed the bedroom door and shot himself.

Many of you are suggesting therapy, being with friends and family and luckily I have a very large family support network around me.  I have been staying with my parents and seeing a therapist.  I appreciate all of the stories and support, its very helpful.
