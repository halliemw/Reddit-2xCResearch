I was just told that I need an interview to work at a small tea house place. It is my first job as I am still a teenager. I don't know how I am supposed to dress or what they will ask me. 

I am pretty sure there is a subreddit for these type of questions but I don't know of it. The interview is in 3 hours and if I would have known about it earlier, I would have posted before. Help!!
