I went out to a pub with some friends tonight, and partway through the only girl in our group, who I don't know very well, disappeared for a while. A woman came up to our table and said she was sick in the restroom, and my friends said I should check it out, since I'm technically biologically female and wouldn't get in trouble. Well I walk in and there's people taking pictures under the stall door, so I ask them to stop taking pictures of my friend and kindly fuck off. I ask her if she's okay and if I can get her water or anything, and she says she's not sick or drunk, just trying to get rid of all the food she ate. She comes out and is talking about how she's upset she wasn't able to throw it up and will have to live with the guilt now. I had no freaking clue what to say, I didn't want to make her feel weird about it so I just kind of... kept nodding sympathetically and said I was glad she was okay.



I have no idea if my reaction was alright, or what I should do when hanging out with her in the future. She said her roommates already know, so I don't feel a huge burden of responsibility, but I'm worried about saying or doing something triggering in future interactions. Like is it insensitive if I talk about how I'm having trouble gaining weight lately? Should I react any differently when she wants to go out and get food, or is encouraging others to buy lots of food so she can share it, or if I notice she's purging again? I haven't really known someone with an eating disorder before, and I don't want to treat her weirdly because of it but I'm also afraid of doing something wrong since they can be so dangerous. Any advice is greatly appreciated. 



Also who the fuck laughs and takes pictures of someone throwing up in a public restroom? Seriously?
