(edit 5)/u/toomanymoose has hit the nail right on the head: "Can we just say "Sit back and listen, THEN comment?" COMMENT AFTER READING AND CONSIDERING THE SUBJECT MATTER TO HELP MAKE THIS A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE PLACE *FOR WOMEN*."

is the spirit of what I was trying to say. As we all know, titles of submitted text posts cannot be edited, so this will have to do. No, I should not have specified 'men', and yes, we will be better served by saying 'newcomers' instead. I will not remove my original comments, for they have been said already and I can admit when I spoke too quickly or rashly. I will not pretend I did not say what I said, and I understand the frustration it has caused. I did not expect this thread to blow up as quickly as it did. Sorry, not sorry, for all the edits.

**Original Post**

I really think this rule could help matters in keeping this subreddit from turning into a total shitshow in light of this change.

Sexism affects women on a personal basis. We all know this. But having uninformed new subscribers arguing hypotheticals with the intent to derail, claiming "not all men are like that", rambling about the man's potential/theoretical intent for the female OP's experiences that they themselves were not present for, "why are you getting so riled up about this", "where are your facts"... (edit 4) **in personal experience posts in particular, not in news articles or opinion pieces, are damaging to this community and unnecessary.** I don't want to force all men to shut up forever by any means, I just want them to step back, breathe, think about whether or not their comment is necessary, whether the OP probably already knows whatever devil's advocacy point you are trying to make, if it will be constructive at all, and maybe x out of the page if it isn't. (/edit 4)

These dismissive comments of women's experiences are all inevitable, and it feels like several huge steps back for our pre-default community. 

If being default is permanent no matter what, no matter how frustrated the community is with the decision, which it seems to be, we need to mitigate the people who come in here totally uninformed for the sanity of the women who post here if we actually expect to keep any women around.

This rule could help in terms of how many women are jumping ship upon the sub going default.

Thoughts? Help with rephrasing? Agree / disagree? Why? Let's have a discussion - it seems more productive than me rambling to myself in the shower about how annoyed I am.

Edit: The operative words here are 'for the sake of it'. I have never taken issue with men participating in 2XC, but I do take issue with men potentially flying into personal issue/experience posts with those sorts of comments when they do not add much to the discussion at hand.

A lot of posts on this subreddit are not about news discussions, but personal issues or experiences faced by women. Playing devil's advocate for funsies in **those** threads is what I am most bothered by.

Edit 3: /u/AsteroPolyp made this suggestion that I think is very astute and much better phrased than my initial post.

>I ABSOLUTELY AGREE!! But say "newcomers" instead of "men."

>Some subreddits put big red boxes above the "leave a comment" box telling you about the subreddit rules. I think we need that. And the rule can really be as simple as you said: this isn't the place to be a smart ass and argue for the sake of it; this is a supportive place.

>Rule #1 says "No assholery" which I think was written specifically about the issue we're talking about. But it needs to be much more prominent now.

I honestly think that is a very good idea. However, right now we are in a stage where we need to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, and we need to protect the basis of this subreddit's existence - women's perspectives.

My kneejerk reaction to this thread blowing up and my less than perfect phrasing was 'oh god, delete it', but I'm keeping it up. This discussion is important and I want to hear other suggestions - otherwise we can't figure this out and move forward.

I do not want to discourage men from contributing at all, but this subreddit, despite it being a default, is not geared towards men. It is for women's experiences, and many guys get too excited about getting into a debate before they think about the emotional impact their 'devil's advocate' posts might cause the OP on, say, an abortion thread, a rape thread, a sexual harassment thread, a period thread... **where the woman is asking for advice, support or help.** I am not trying to hamper discussion over topics where both men and women could have a say, like news articles, opinion pieces, etc. I see where it sounded like that, but that was not my intent.

There are times and places for discussion between men and women, but I do not want women to lose their platform in our own subreddit just because we have become a default.

Edit 5: I get the feeling that if I try to clarify or delete the (admittedly) badly worded first part of my post, I will be accused of backpedalling. No idea why, guess I must be psychic. Regardless, I admit that my phrasing is dismissive of men as a gender and that that detracts from what I want to accomplish, and what 2XC intrinsically stands for. 

I wanted to spitball with you guys here, but I simply do not have the time or energy to reply to every single person. If you want to believe me to be sexist, that is absolutely your right to do so. At least the discussion is starting.
