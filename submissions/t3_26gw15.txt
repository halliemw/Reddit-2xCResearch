I just realized that it's almost June and all I have left from previous summers is one ill-fitting bikini top! 

All suggestions are welcome, as I know my friends are also in a similar predicament. I am looking at h&m right now because cheaps, but what are the pros and cons of your favorite shops?

Also...does anyone look good in those high-waisted reto bikini bottoms? I feel like my muffin top would make a seriously unwelcome appearance.

My main issue is that I'm a 30DDD so everything either starts slipping or it has to have ties, which always end up plastered to my back or making me think a squid is swimming past D:
