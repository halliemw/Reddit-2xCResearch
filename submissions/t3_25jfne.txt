Would there be any interest in a subreddit devoted to female attorneys? If so, what would you want to see in it? I'm thinking it ought to be private/invite only. I'd like to see a variety of posts, from intellectual (news articles, bar journal articles) to practical (job and salary comparisons, career advice), to personal (rants about stereotyping or even just non misogyny related dick behavior). I don't want it to devolve into the lame career services dress code suggestion crap we see all the time. Thoughts?

**EDIT: /r/LadyLawyers is a go. Please message me directly if you would like an invite.**
