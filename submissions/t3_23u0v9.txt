So, I should've ordered new packs of birth control pills last week, but I forgot to. I take my last pill in my last package tomorrow night, and the day after that is my first day of my pill-free week. If my next packs of birth control pills don't arrive until 2 weeks or so after my pill-free week (or if they arrive at any time after I need to start taking them again) is that bad for my body? Is it bad for my body to have to go about 2 weeks without birth control pills? Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post in, I wasn't completely sure where to post this.
