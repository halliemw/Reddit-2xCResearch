Hello ladies, and some gents, you are such a lovely supportive bunch I thought I'd come here looking for a little advice and perspective. A few months ago I started dating a friend I've had for years. Its fantastic! I've never felt so happy and supported through my whole life. However last night he dropped some heavy news. He might be required to move to the west coast for his job. He is looking to purchase the magazine he has been working at.  This is wonderful news for him and he has questioned whether or not I would be able to attend school in the province where he will be going. I'm about to start my second degree in a very competitive program that is only offered at a handful of schools in my country. There is only one that I could go to and it would be a substantial amount more money than I currently have and would be able to save. 

He won't know if he needs to move for another few months so it's all up in the air. I feel pretty choked and I want to handle this in the healthiest way possible but I'm just not that good at waiting! My last boyfriend told me he was leaving me when he left to go tree planting a month before he left and it was a very miserable month. I think I might be extra edgy because of this. My current boyfriend says he really doesn't want to have to leave me and his family and the wonderful support and community he has built in our city, but this is a huge opportunity for him and at 25 he needs to focus on his career.

Any thoughts or related experience are welcome. If you have any suggestions on how to be level headed about this and wait it out patiently I would so much love to read it!

TLDR: Boyfriend may have to move across the country for work but won't know for a few more months. I'm anchored where I am for school. Looking for advice on how to handle this in a healthy,positive and supportive way.
