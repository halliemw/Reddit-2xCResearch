This is my second yeast infection ever, and as a 16 year old I'm just grossed out. I have enough stress as it is, and having an extremely irritated vagina does not help at all. :( It's so embarrassing and shameful, even though it happens for no particular reason. 


The worst part is, it's currently nighttime and I'm unable to leave the house to get Monistat, so I'll have to deal with the itching until tomorrow afternoon. We also don't have any garlic or plain yogurt in the house. Any remedies for the itching, ladies? Or just words of comfort? :(
