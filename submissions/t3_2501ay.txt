This may not be the best time to post after all the talk with TwoX becoming a new default sub, but I'm really having a moment. This weekend I spent the night over at the apartment of someone I'm currently sleeping with who I truly thought was a nice guy until this happened. Sunday morning as I got out of bed to put my clothes the flash went off on his phone as he tried to take a picture. I freaked out, told him to delete it, and asked if he had any others. He told me no but refused to show me his phone. I'm terrified that there could be other pictures in worse situations with even my face in it. It's all I can think about, and I'm terrified that he could leak them or show them to his friends or anything. 

I'm so unsure right now. I don't trust him enough to take his word and we're not in the sort of relationship that I would be okay with those kind of pictures being on his phone. What do I do? Thanks in advance.

**Edit:** I just read all of everybody's comments and I want to say thank you all SO MUCH. It's really helping me to see things I can do that I couldn't think of myself. I've told one of my closest friends what happened and we came up with a plan. I've texted him and asked him to meet me for coffee somewhere and I'm going to do what /u/VGwritesalot has written. I made sure it's legal so I'm ready to go. I just want to make sure I have something I can use if I ever find any pictures of me online or anywhere else. Once again, thank you so much 2X!
