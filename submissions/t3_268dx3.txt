I've been on TwoX for years now and I've read every sort of post that comes up here. I've seen so many opinions and experiences, and I want to say one thing to everyone here:

It's okay to stand up for yourself!

It's okay to tell people no. It's okay to tell them you're uncomfortable. It's okay to be assertive. It's okay to tell someone to leave you alone. It's okay to call someone on their bullshit.

Don't be afraid of being seen as a bitch. That's not your problem. Hell, it can be a solution to your problem. You don't have to take shit from anybody. You don't have to sit there demurely in silence because you're a woman. You don't have to put up with being disrespected.  You may have been taught growing up that good girls are quiet and submissive. You don't have to stick to that as an adult.
