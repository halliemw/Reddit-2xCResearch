So my male partner, 26, and I, 22, are in a situation: he ejaculated in me without my knowledge and permission. He did so with the intent to get me pregnant, thinking that is a way to stay in my life forever. He has self-esteem issues, but communication is big in our relationship. Obviously, with what happened, it's taken a backseat. 

I have voiced my opinion that should I ever become pregnant for the third time, I already have two children, I wouldn't hesitate to have an abortion. I already have too much going on in my life and cannot be slowed down with an infant. What makes matters worse, is that I'm a widow. I know people have different times of grieving and all, which is another reason I do not want to be pregnant and the partner knows all of this. I'm still trying to get the hang of being without my husband and finish school and provide for my children without someone else butting in with their bullshit.

He has voiced that he will not let me get an abortion because it's not something he wants. When he told me that, I immediately responded with, "Well, I was never asked if I wanted to be impregnated, but it happened anyways." 

I would like to hear any and every bit of advice this wonderful subreddit has to offer. 
And by the way, I am planning on getting "Plan B" as soon as I get my paycheck. Hopefully, I'm still within the time limit.
