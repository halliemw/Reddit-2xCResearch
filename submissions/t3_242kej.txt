Welp, I have a question. I feel a bit silly asking, but I feel like I've missed out on a lot.

**Girls, what do you do when you're alone?**

I've spent almost the entirety of my adult(ish) life in relationships.
There seems to be the unhealthy pattern of spending too much time together too fast and then sort of becoming inseparable. I've been so dependent on other people, that I've found myself going from partner to partner. **I don't know how to be alone.** I don't want it to be that way!

For the first time, I, a 24 year old woman, am alone. I live with my parents (who stay out of my way, for the most part), but this is the first time I've spent significant time without a partner.

And ... I don't know what to do with myself. It's not even that I have to "relearn" how to be alone ... because I really haven't ever been! What do you do? 

Even if you're not single, I suppose most healthy relationships still have "alone time". What do you during alone time? How do you fill your days? What are your hobbies? How often do you see friends or go out? What fun dorky things do you do to entertain yourself? 

Right now, I fill the "void" (I need to change my perspective- **it isn't about filling a void, its about enjoying alone time!**) by mindlessly and compulsively switching between reddit and facebook, watching Bob's Burgers, and occasionally reading. 

But *I catch myself looking at the time, thinking "augh, its still so early. What am I going to do until it's time to sleep?" That's not healthy!*

When does this change? Does it get easier over time? Do I have to make a conscious effort to push myself? 

Anyway, I'm going to Whole Foods now to get desert by myself. I want to get out of the house and enjoy myself. Wish me luck!
