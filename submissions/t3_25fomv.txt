I'm going on a date this weekend! And for the first time in a long time, it's with a guy I like. I've been on dates, but it's usually "just because" and not because I actually feel something for him. And I've liked men, but it's never worked out where we actually go on a date. So for the first time in years, I'M GOING ON A DATE WITH A GUY I LIKE. He's a smart, funny (and ridiculously sexy) dude.  
  
I'm just super nervous and a million thoughts are running through my mind. What if he doesn't really like me? What if he only wants to have sex with me and not actually start something worthwhile? I want to have sex with him so bad, but if I sleep with him on the first date, will he get the wrong impression? What if I can't think of things to say and we end up sitting in awkward silence? What if he's a super conservation, pro-life, misogynistic dude and really good at hiding it? What if the weekend comes and he just decides he doesn't want to go on a date anymore? 

I'm so fucking nervous. And it's so embarrassing I can't speak to my real life girlfriends about this. So, uh, my internet girl friends, how do you keep yourself cool on dates? And how do you prevent yourself from imagining every possible scenario? Or, should I just get myself checked into an institution? HELP ME, INTERNET??Â¿?
