If you're wanting a longish read you've come to the right post... 

4 1/2 years ago my beautiful mother (41) went out to the bar which she NEVER does to celebrate her birthday with her friends. That night she met a younger man (29) and spent the night dancing with him. That night he drove her home and they sat in the driveway for **four hours** just talking and laughing - I don't sleep much so I spied a lot of the time to make sure no naughtyness was going on. - At this time the sun was coming up so she gave him her e-mail (she got drunk and lost her cell, good job Ma! I remember my first beer.) and told him if he got bored to e-mail her. I was up and she was twirling around and was ontop of the world telling me about this mystery man. 10 minutes later she checks her e-mail and in her inbox was a love note. Something along the lines of "I had one of the best nights of my life with you, I'm not sure if this is too quick but I need to see you again." and from then on they were in love. 

We'll call him Bryan. Bryan NEVER wanted kids and it took him 5 months to meet my brother (at that time 20) and I (at that time 17) and he instantly loved my brother and I and we loved him. We did everything together and if we weren't together we were sending eachother goofy text messages. My brother moved out and my mom, Bryan, and I built a house together. I became his daughter and he became the best father i've ever had. It didn't matter that we were kind of close in age, if he met someone he introduced me as his daughter. Not his girlfriends daughter, but his even though him and my mom never actually got married. We've even had talks about him walking me down the isle one day, my kids calling him papa, everything. 

Well on Friday May 2nd he was watching TV with my mom when he got up, looked at her, and said:
Him: **"I can't do this anymore."**
Mom: "What are you talking about?"
Him: "I can't do this." 
- he starts to leave - 
Mom: "Please, Bryan, tell me what's going on." 
Him: "I want kids, okay? I want my own family. I need you and Kelsey to leave." 
Mom: "Where did this come from, Bryan? What's going on?" 

So he packs a bag and leaves. He tells my mom he's staying at his best friend Shawn's house and we don't hear from him. As the time goes on he starts missing us. Asks to come eat with us, asks to sleep at the house, etc. It's gotten to the point where he keeps just begging for my moms attention. He even sneaks into the house and crawls into bed with her. On the 16th he cried to my mom and told her how much he loved her and wanted things to work but there just wasn't something there. Welp, come May 17th he falls asleep in bed with her again and she hears his phone go off. It's another woman texting him. She reads through his messages with her and they date back to the begining of this year and I guess he's been dating her AND bonding with her very young son. 

**My mom is crushed** 

She runs into my room and gives me his phone and my heart sinks into my belly. They're saying they love eachother, he can't wait to see her and her son, they're talking about dinner, they're talking about things a family talks about. This is even before he ever ended things with my mom. I can't breathe, i'm shaking, my mom is sobbing.

**so I call her.** 

She answers and is very confused since it was now 130AM and technically the 18th. I tell her how Bryan is in bed with my mom and just cried over her and still says he loves her. She's confused and sounds annoyed but won't really talk. Won't admit to how long they have been dating despite me saying I saw their text messages, won't tell me anything. It was a 10 minute conversation but it felt like forever. We hangup and I have my mom clean up and get into bed and told her to follow my lead. She gets into bed and I barge into their bedroom and it goes like this:

- flips on light - 
Mom: "Kelsey, what is it?"
Me: "WAKE UP BRYAN."
Bryan: "Huh? What? What's going on?"
Me: "I just got off of the phone with your GIRLFRIEND."
Mom: "What? What is she talking about Bryan?"
Me: "Yeah Bryan, why don't you tell my mom about VERONICA." 
- At this time he puts his hands behind his head and he has a sarcastic smirk on his face and he's shaking his head and staring at the ceiling. - 

He won't talk to us despite me sobbing and screaming at him. How he was MY dad and how much I loved him and how much he royally fucked up. 

He won't talk.
He won't even answer a simple question.
He put on a hat, shoes, and left my mom and I in the middle of the road and didn't look back. 

My mom is broken... we're homeless now. When they first started dating our house got foreclosed on and her credit was screwed from there. I'm only 20 and have no credit. No apartment will take us and we can't afford a house. I'm making more money out of the 2 of us. We have family but they aren't in a good situation either. We're still staying at Bryan's house but now that this happened I don't know what we're going to do....



I guess I just need some of you ladies to share horror stories and stories of recovery and tell me it will all be okay.... I just need to know my mom and I will be okay....
