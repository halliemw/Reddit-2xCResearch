Now that this site has become a default I have been reading some of the stories on here and I have a question I wanted to ask but what are your thoughts on women in UFC? 

I was at a bar a few weeks ago and a womens UFC fight came on, the entire room was filled with men and there was no catcalling, I didn't hear anything sexist, it looked like a group of guys watching a fight just like any other fight. 

So I was just curious to know this subreddits thoughts on women in UFC.
