So this morning I woke up, did my business and put in a new tampon. 

30 minutes later, here come the period shits, full force. 

How do you keep the string clean when wiping? My current method of choice is to hold it away from the war zone with a piece of tp then wipe with more tp using the other hand. 

However this fails to work when I reach for more tp, sometimes I need two hands and the string then drops and....touches things.

Ofc I can just put in a whole new tampon but...they're expensive, and I hate being wasteful.
