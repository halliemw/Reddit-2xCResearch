HAHAHAHAHAHAA, no really I am loving it.

I just want to know what IFF stands for (I promise I did a search, can't find an explanation or any obvious pattern between the posts)



Edit: 

* I'm an idiot, it's in the sidebar (but who reads those things anyway?)
* IFF stands for "Image Fest Friday" but /u/lightbulb_feet had a much better interpretation ("I'm Feeling Fabulous")
* No, I'm not masturbating. I was typing with one hand because I was holding my baby with the other.
* The care and feeding of a woman's undercarriage is a serious matter. Please don't take all your advice from some guy on the internet.
