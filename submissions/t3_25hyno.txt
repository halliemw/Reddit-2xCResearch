I'm almost 21, I've been sexually active for a few years now, and there's been a lot of cancer in my family history, so I know at some point soon I should get a pap test done. But I'm having a really hard time talking myself into it. 

I know it's going to hurt. I'm really small (5'0, ~90lbs) and I have issues with all kinds of medical equipment. I leave the dentist with my mouth feeling like I've chewed barbed wire because even the children's sized stuff is too big for my mouth. I also have had a lot of painful sex because above-average sized penises are literally too big for me, and if a guy sticks more than two fingers in my vagina, it hurts at first (even if we're using lube, and even if there's been a lot of foreplay/I'm really aroused). I can't even imagine how much it's going to hurt when a doctor sticks a speculum up there. 

I'm also worried about how I'm going to be able to handle it emotionally. I've had some sexual experiences that were not entirely consensual on my part, and I'm worried that the pain I'll be in plus the general discomfort of medical exams will trigger something in me. I would really not like to be traumatized during what should be a routine visit.

Any advice? Am I just exaggerating how bad this is going to be?
