I have a wonderful man, and a beautiful step-daughter, yet I still feel isolated and completely alone. 
I feel outside the circle and it sucks. 

Anyone else in this boat? Advice? 
We have talked about it. They've been on their own for years, so I know it takes time but shit sucks. I do every Goddamn thing a proper house wife should, and I work forty plus a week. They have a hot meal every night (home made, from scratch, no boxed shit, no take out) laundry, cleaning, the whole shebang....still, at times I feel alone and excluded

Anyone else have this issue? And / or can offer advice?
