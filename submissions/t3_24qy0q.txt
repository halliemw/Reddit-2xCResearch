I've spent the past few months in a depressive state, I'm on an up and I've been getting the help I need. I work in an office, but I can frequently work from home. I would occasionally come into the office where I maybe knew I was on a rough day. So I could maybe see where I'd smell bad. 

But today, i stopped to talk to much boss and he apparently thought it had been brought up to me. I asked if it was a problem today, because I had showered the night before and basically just went to bed a few hours later. He said yes. So I guess i am just a particularly odiforous person. So it's something I need to be aware of. 

The reason I come to you ladies, is well. I have noticed something about my lady bits. I am constantly damp. Like I don't know if it's all sweat (I'm not extra sweaty anywhere else) or discharge or something. I don't have any stds my most recent pap came back normal. (less than a year ago) but I guess I'm just always... Oozing. Is that normal? (it probably is within the realm of normal) and if anyone has suffered the same sort of issue, how did you deal with it?
