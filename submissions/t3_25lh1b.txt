Hi girls,

I'm freaking out at 6 AM and you're the ones I'm turning to (at least until I can get a doctor on the phone!)

This month, I switched to a new birth control pill because Yasim was giving me mood swings. I started this pill-- Qlairista-- one week after finishing the active pills in my last packet (so like 4 days into my period).

So with the new pills-- took the first 3 weeks, skipped the last week of placebo, bingo bango all set, right?

Turns out, this BC pill is a 26-day cycle (which I had never even heard of). I live abroad and all the instructions are in a foreign language which I didn't bother to parse through as I just assumed it was like every other pill I'd taken (I know, I'm stupid, I didn't think anything of the color change in the pills).

So. Basically I missed the last 5 days in my packet.

I took my last pill on this past Saturday. I had unprotected sex the day before that, and on Tuesday (two days ago-- it's Thursday morning here). I would normally have gotten my period around Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, but nada.

So, my question to you all is....help?! Should I take Plan B? Is it too late for that because I didn't finish the last 5 pills anyway? Or maybe I even started the packet too late? If I do take Plan B, will it make pregnancy tests not work and leave me in limbo for weeks? And, how do I go about getting back on the pill through this sea of hormones and medication?

Oh and-- took a pregnancy test last night and it was negative. I know it's pretty early for that, though.



Thanks girls. I'm extra frightened as the idea of getting an abortion so far from home is really scary to me.
