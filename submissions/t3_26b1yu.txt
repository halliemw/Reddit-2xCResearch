Actual quote a woman (co-worker) said to me last night.

A conversation about her working out turned into comments like her guessing my weight, (which I allowed and said I wouldn't get offended, she guessed 10 pounds over).

The real comments that got to me were *"Have you always been big/husky?" "Were you ever skinny?" "Have you thought about losing weight?" "Have you tried to lose weight?"*

Reddit, I am a 205 pound, 5'3 woman and I know I am overweight. I know this. Maybe I am in denial and hearing it was hard. I have never been bigger than this but have fluctuated 10 pounds for the last two years. I feel I have come to accept this is what I look like. I am healthy. My doctor recently did a full checkup and my sugars are good, cholesterol, everything is healthy. I am not pre-diabetic. I am not sick. 

**TL;DR I am torn between my wanting to accept myself and wanting to get back on the diet wagon (I am always on and off of it).**
