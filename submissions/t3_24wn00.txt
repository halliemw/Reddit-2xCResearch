Literally less than an hour ago I went to my local Planned Parenthood and got the Mirena IUD inserted. I was super super scared. But turns out the insertion wasn't that bad! It really felt like a bad cramps, actually I've probably have had stronger cramp pain. I just wanted to come here and share my insertion experience since most of the stuff on here are horror stories. 

How I'm feeling right now ( 1 hour out):
I feel very crampy. It feels like my body is getting used to the object. The cramps aren't too bad. I have a hot water bag over it. 

I hope my body will adjust well to the IUD. I will provide updates as time goes on!
