Went to the dentist yesterday & was told that I need all four wisdom teeth pulled. I made the appointment for a few weeks out, and once I got home read up on wisdom teeth removal (prep, aftercare, the whole 9). I came across more than a few articles that say women who are menstruating should try to schedule the extraction for the week leading up to their cycle, and definitely try to avoid having the procedure done while on their period. Lo and behold, my appointment is scheduled for the day I'm supposed to start (I use the P Tracker app & my periods are VERY regular to the point where I know what hour of the day it will start). Rescheduling shouldn't be an issue - but in case it is, has anyone else ever heard of this/had this experience? 

Knowing that I need a major oral surgery is bad enough, and I definitely don't want to have to worry about blood coming out of both ends of my body while I'm coming out of the anesthesia. Any tips/advice is appreciated.
