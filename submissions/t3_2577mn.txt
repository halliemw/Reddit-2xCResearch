I'm 41, man. I haven't had bullshit like this since I was 19-ish. I'm a week away from the Red River and suddenly there's acne everywhere (and I do mean *everywhere*), 

Next will come the cramps, sweats, and period shits...when the flood hits.

And PMS like no other is kicking my face in right now.

My gyn insists I'm not perimenopausal yet. I'm declaring shenanigans. 

I'm getting hellacious pimples on my boobs and even down yonder on the ol' meat curtains. (I think it's an ingrown hair). 

I can't do BC (I have blood clot issues) so I'm doing Black Cohosh, soy isoflavins, and Evening Primrose Oil. Anything else I can do?

I guess I could go exploit my pimples for karma in r/popping.
