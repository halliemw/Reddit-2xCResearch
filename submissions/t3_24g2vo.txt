Hey there!  I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this--if it is, feel free to remove it and I'll try in a more appropriate one. c:

I'm a trans girl, and I've just recently started to go basically full time, which is awesome! :D  I'm having a lot of fun finally wearing girlclothes (and getting overwhelmed trying to find what I like!  But that's its own issue c:).

However, I've also started to notice a problem I've been having.  I really love to wear dresses, but if I wear them (or anything else with an open bottom) without tights, I become really, really uncomfortable about my legs.

I don't really know why. D:  I do know I think my knees look a little weird, but I don't know if it's just that or something else.  Other people's reassurances unfortunately doesn't seem to help. >.<

I actually do really like wearing tights, so that's how I've gotten around this for now.  However, my friend suggests wearing the dresses without them, and it's also starting to warm up for Spring around here, so I probably can't keep wearing the tights forever.

Plus, I've noticed myself feeling the same thing when I wear some shorts. :c  When I'm not wearing dresses, I just wear jeans (which are again starting to be a little problematic due to the increasing heat).

I know this doesn't necessarily have an easy answer, but how do I stop feel so self-conscious about my legs?  I certainly can't keep avoiding this forever, and I just want to be able to wear a cute dress without being uncomfortable with myself.

Thank you very much! :)
