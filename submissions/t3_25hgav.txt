This has been all over the internet today but dunno if it's made its way to twoxchromosomes yet.  I have friends who went through the homeschool networks in Richmond and even attended this prom. They enjoyed their homeschool experiences and are now happy functioning adults. But kicking a girl out for a perceived dress code violation makes the whole system look backwards and only enforces the "And on the third day, God created the Remington bolt-action rifle, so that Man could fight the dinosaurs and the homosexuals" stereotype. Thoughts?

Edit: Title may point just to the dads but it was indeed a woman who threw her out. She does, however, mention feeling oggled by the fathers from the balcony.)
