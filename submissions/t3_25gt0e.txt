Hi there. Obviously a throw away...

I needed morning after pill yesterday afternoon as a back up after a broken condom.

THEN, last night, he wore a condom as always but I guess we also had sex over night? We were kinda tired and tipsy. I consented because it was late and sexy and whatever but this morning there is that.. feeling like he came in me, and even if he didn't I just want to be sure.

Now, I called PP to ask if I needed another EC, because I think my guy had sex and came in me, but not sure...

She said she, by law, had to report it, and still didn't tell me if I needed another EC.

What does that mean?! I have NO TIME for police and this bullshit and need to go to my 2 jobs and will prob be having no time and just buy OTC but I'm pretty broke... my real first question is, what does that mean?!

She kept saying "if you dont report it, we have to"... how would she know I reported it* and also, honestly, I really don't want police involved in this.
