This is my first time I am asking for advice here.. (I have a different account in general) As I elaborately described in the title, this is the situation. We met randomly and caught each other's eye in a public place. Got to know each other a bit and soon after decided to be exclusive. I haven't felt so secure and happy around one individual (I guess except my mom :) ) ever. We have many different opinions yet similar values, we feel like we 'get' each other, I feel like I know him although I actually really don't. It just seems right and something clicks that has never clicked romantically/sexually/emotionally with any guy before.

He barely has time every week, just the weekends and he has so much to do for himself that it is hard for him to find time for me. Yet, he still does try to find time. I come from a psych & soc background so I can't stop analyzing.

Can you help me come up with some perspective on this? Ask me questions, tell me to clarify some stuff, give advice.. I just need to do as much thinking through as possible before I can truly trust & commit.
