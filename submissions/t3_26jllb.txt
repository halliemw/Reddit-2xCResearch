For a about a week I've been incredibly emotional. I can hardly listen to a song without crying my eyes out. My boyfriend has to tiptoe around what he says or else I'm angry then crying then laughing in a second. 

Normally I'm not like this at all, except for around when my period shows up. The weird thing is that I got my period not to long ago. So I know I'm not about to start it. I'm on the pill, but i did miss one a few weeks ago. My period I just recently got though lasted only five days (normally 7) and was much lighter then it normally is. 

Now onto the tmi, my discharge has been a lot different also. Very runny, odorless, and a milky white. Plus I've been having to run to the bathroom about three times a day because so much comes out. I've never had this happen before. 

I have been nauseous but just last Wednesday I had a kidney infection and I've been taking antibiotics so I'm not sure if it's just from that. 

When should I take a test? It's only been two weeks from the missed period is it to soon? Or is this all normal body behavior and should I get my mental state tested? Thank you much
