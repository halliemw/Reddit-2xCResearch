Hi Ladies!!

My brain is being all sorts of stupid crazy and has me being really upset about this stupid boy and a stupid complicated situation I don't want to deal with. But I can't stop thinking about it and him and other things that are making me upset. So. What are your favorite websites (other than reddit...) that you waste time on?

I've been watching Hart of Dixie and seeing weird parallels to my life, so that isn't helping too much despite how much I love Zoe and Wade. Especially shirtless Wade. Other shows, websites, anything to help distract me from my stupid brain and heart. 

Thanks in advance, I love you all!
