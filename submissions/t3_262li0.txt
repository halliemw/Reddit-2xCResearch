Hi ladies! I'm a junior high student (that's gr.7, 8, 9 or ages 12-15). This morning, something happened at my school which all of us female students are quite upset about. To start, there is a strict dress code policy in place at my school. Now, usually, we just suck it up when it comes to this topic, even though the code is often applied inconsistently or unfairly. However, today, a couple of girls in my grade put up posters in the halls in protest. The posters said to stop sexualizing 13 year old's legs and shoulders, and that it shouldn't be up to us to cover ourselves up to stop boys from sexualizing us, that should be something they educate themselves about. A petition was also passed around promoting a bit more leniency in the code, and gained a lot of support. The teachers ripped all the posters off the walls and threw away the petition. Not to mention, the girls got in huge trouble. Let me stress that none of this was done in bad taste, all of the posters and the petition were polite and professional. The female student body is angry, but we don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
