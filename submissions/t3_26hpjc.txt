i admit,I'm not one to ask for help. BUT if you say you want to help me then F-ing do it!!! this is silly, mostly just a get it off my chest and feel better thing BUT... if you are a guy and you think or say you are "not like other guys" OR you don't say that and you are the type who says "just let me help"... JUST FUCKING DO IT!!! I'm stubborn, i know it. I have soooo many things under my belt right now. I will not "assign" you a job. I will tell you all the things I need to tackle and hope you catch on. If I tell you that I have to vacuum, Spackle, mow the grass, take care of the termites, clean the gutter, dig the garden,  fold my clothes, walk the dog, shovel the (what ever) and dance a jig.. don't wait for me to do all that before we hook up, HELP me get it done and DON'T WAIT for me to tell you what to do!!!  use COMMON FUCKING SENSE!!! yup, just my buzzed rant while my "please let me help you " BF is asleep on the couch as I I do all the above and try to plan for my next day off tackling what I don't get done.
