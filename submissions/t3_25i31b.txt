I'm sorry this might be misplaced, but what's sisterhood without a few good stories, I guess? This is long but if you can get to the end without crying I'll give you something. And forgive me I've been drinking. Okay so, my dad and I have always had kind of a strained relationship. He was a long road mover and so was gone 3 weeks out of the month. 

When I turned 12 he offered to take me on a move out to California with him in the truck. The trip was great, other than some mishaps like him leaving me alone in the truck all night in Nevada while he gambled. And I'm not trying to sound bitter or anything, I realize he had/has a problem. There's just no other way to say it, really. But one thing that kind of got on my nerves was he was constantly asking me to sit up in the front with him and look out the window. I was little so I was SUPER stoked about being in a bed, but in a TRUCK. Omg. So I actually didn't spend a lot of time in the front seat, but lying down, watching traded videos (and, consequently napping).

Over the years we've alternated between feuding over family drama to talking once every six months. But here's the conversation we had today via text:

"You know what's like the biggest regret of my life ever /
when you took me on that awesome trip out to california in the truck and i was too busy being a stupid kid in awe of there being a bed in a truck to sit in the front like i should have/
im sorry/
i missed so much

What brought that on?

dunno that's one thing that pops into my mind when i feel kind of shitty /because it like literally is one of the top couple things i regret in life so it naturally surfaces when im depressed

some time goes by and he doesn't answer, and I think I've said something to offend him because he's good at replying, and then I get these:

Then I get,
"I love you honey hope those helped a little."
