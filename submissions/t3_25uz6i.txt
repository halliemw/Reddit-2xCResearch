Getting married in 2 weeks!

I never heard the advice to pee after sex until I started reading this sub, it was never something that came up in sex ed, and I figured there are probably lots of other things I should know that I haven't come across yet...so come at me!

I really don't want to get a uti or yeast infection on my honeymoon...what precautions can I take against this? do those cranberry supplements work?

And is there a kind of lube that is better than others? I know you're supposed to used water-based with condoms, right? but is there a benefit to using non-water-based if your not using condoms?

Thanks in advance 

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all your advice! It's lovely to be able to have this kind of discussion (especially as it might be more awkward to have in person with people I actually know). And thanks to everyone who has congratulated me on my upcoming marriage! I really appreciate it :)

An additional question, if anyone's still reading this - Is it important to pee after receiving oral sex or hand stuff, like it is after PIV sex?
