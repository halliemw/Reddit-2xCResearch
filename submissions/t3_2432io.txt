I don't know if this is a stupid question, but I'm having my period again and it's only been 14 days since I had my period. I'm young-ish - 20 years old - and healthy otherwise. I'm usually regular (and if not, it's usually a bit late), so that's why I'm nervous about this. 

What are some possible reasons for this? Any reason for concern?
