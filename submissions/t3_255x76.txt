As in, skip the placebo every month and just go straight to the next pack? I'm curious because it seems like a new trend and a lot of people look at me strangely when I tell them I don't regularly have a period. I've received comments that it's unhealthy but I feel fine after doing this for ~2 years. It was my gynecologist that recommended it, btw. 

I'm only bringing it up because I accidentally missed one day and now I am having a period haha.
