I tried posting this in a different sub, but its basically a dead subreddit. I need help with clothing advice! My husband has his university graduation ceremony coming up in New Zealand (Auckland) and I want to look nice for him and the occasion. However I have no idea if I should dress up. The graduations I've been to in America seem to have the majority of people looking nice and a few people in everyday clothes. Would a silk maxi dress with flowers on it be a bit much? Not to mention I'll be meeting his side of the family for the first time and need to wear appropriate clothing, (sorry ladies, no miniskirts, birthday suit or boobies displayed loud and proud). Any help is appreciated. Thanks! :)
