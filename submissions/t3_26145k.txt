I just recently finished a gender studies class and one of our last discussions together was revolved around cat calling. Every girl in the class raised their hand when the professor asked us which one of us has experienced street harassment, while the two boys did not. We then discussed how we individually handled it, and what feelings/thoughts arouse during and after the incident.

Some explained that they retaliated by either saying a remark or flipping them off, but most of the group explained that you just feel really terrible and scared and nervous. Even when we told stories of trying to stick up for ourselves, it was instantly riddled with fear, accelerated heart rates, and walking quickly to a safe destination. We even talked about how women are always told to take self defense classes, to carry pepper spray, to not go out during certain hours of the day, and to not wear specific clothing to arouse others to want to yell at us.

I guess I'm just asking, have you been harassed verbally in public and how did you deal with it? How did you feel after? Did you receive any support by strangers or people you may have been hanging out with? Do you feel like you can defend yourself without consequence?
