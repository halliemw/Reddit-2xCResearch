Greetings ladies,

Allow me please to go straight (Ha!) to the point and ask you a very personal question, feel free to use a throw away account if necessary.

So, let see humm (this is harder than I thought!)... Have you ever had a crush on another lady? Even if you consider yourself the straightest(?) woman ever? If yes, how did you handle it? What happened? How do you identify now?

I'm asking because for the first time in my life, I'm experiencing it and I feel like I'm losing my marbles!

**TL,DR:** I'm 27 years old woman and I always and still is very much attracted to men. I've never ever felt any attraction to women before, yet, since two months ago, I've been having this terrible crush on my female coworker and it's freaking me out!

EDIT: My original post was way too long and I think it may have frightened some of you out. So I kept only the minimum, hopefully I'll get some answers, if not I'll try to repost later.
