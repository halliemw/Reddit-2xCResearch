Hey everyone, 

So I am no longer jail bound (been there done that a year ago), but I was just thinking back to some short stories about my stay, and wanted to see if anyone had stories that they found funny, horrifying, all of the above, etc. Feel free to share here!

I guess I would be remiss if I did not start,so I will share one that happened right at the beginning of my sentence. So, at intake, we had to be strip searched, and the woman before me was undergoing the search. WHen asked to "bend over and cough", she hesitantly does so, only for something to emerge from her...lady area. After being implored to remove it, out comes...cellophane wrapped carrots. To this day, I don't know what the hell happened xD.
