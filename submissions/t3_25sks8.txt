Hey there, TwoX, long time reader, first time poster.

I (F/mid 20s) have this unexplained vaginal discharge. It's white, doesn't really smell bad, and is pretty constant. I haven't had this much discharge since puberty - needless to say, this is not normal for me. Also, my inner labia are noticeably swollen. This has been going on for at least three weeks. 

I saw a doctor, and was tested for BV, yeast, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea, and everything came up negative. I had some minor abdominal pain (unrelated to my menstrual cycle) so I asked to be tested for a UTI, which also came up negative. I'm also not pregnant. 

The doctor told me that the increased discharge could be because I have a new intimate partner. I doubt this, because I haven seen him in weeks. She also said it might be an allergic reaction and advised I wear cotton underwear (FYI, I literally don't own underwear that isn't cotton and never have). The doctor then sent me on my way. 

I'm really frustrated. This discharge is starting to piss me off. I haven't changed major anything about my diet or started any new medications. My detergent is the same, and my shampoo is one that I've used before with no side effects. The only body-related thing I've done in the past few months was get the first round of the HPV vaccine. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? What did you do? Right now I'm planning to ask the doctor to check me for cervical cancer and refer me for allergy testing.
