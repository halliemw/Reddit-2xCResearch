Personally I think armpit hair is mildly gross on anyone (I mentioned this to my SO and he shaved even though I said it doesn't greatly bother me) so I shave my pits almost every day. I shave my legs and my nether regions whenever the mood strikes me and is usually a monthly thing because I just don't care enough to do it more frequently.

So, twox, how often do you shave and why?
