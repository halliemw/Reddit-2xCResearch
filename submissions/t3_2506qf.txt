I am currently a 6th and 7th grade science teacher in rural South Carolina.  We finish up state testing this week but still have until the last week of may with our kids.  Many teachers just show movies or do unimportant things during this time but I'd like to do something for my students that can really make a difference for them before I say goodbye.  As I teach single-sex classes, I can do something different for my ladies than I do for my gentlemen and I fully intend on this. The only stipulations are that I have to be able to relate it to science, and--while I would love to teach sex ed because they need it--anything that is too sex based is likely to be rejected by administration.  I was thinking about doing some body image and nutrition stuff.  I'd really like to hit on topics that will be informative and helpful to them as young girls that they are unlikely to have an adult address with them otherwise.  Anyone have any ideas or resources?  What would you have liked to have said to you at 11-13 years old?
