I think the sub has been inundated with relationship questions since it went default. I'm not anti-relationship questions, but they seem to have become a large percentage of the total content. I can understand why people would want to pose a relationship question to THIS sub specifically because I identify with the community, and see a lot of supportive, non blame gamey advice. 

I think work interactions, and social interaction questions are more along the lines of this sub's daily mission because the advice is normally pretty universal while relationship questions tend to be very specific to the person posing them.

I think we should do something like Tuesday and Thursday relationship advice day... and (of course) the occasional post seeking advice about leaving an abuser should not be deleted because the poster's crisis didn't happen to fall on a certain day of the week.

Thoughts? Concerns? Ideas? Suggestions?
