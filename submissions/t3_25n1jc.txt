For a decade I've been actively avoiding pregnancy like the plague.  It was this thing that ruined lives and kept people from careers and graduating.  Suddenly I'm in a place where I'm not avoiding it and it's so weird. 

I thought that decision would make sex more liberated, and some ways it is, but dealing with come (like how the hell do I clean up) and this "am I pregnant now? how bout now?" (Like the Verizon guy) feeling is odd.  I have friends that are married parents already and friends that are single and say it's gross (jokingly) that I settled down.  I'm a week in and the transition feels odd.

Edit:  By "dealing with come" I mean I assumed the vagina would just sort of absorb it instead of dribbling out.  The first time letting him inside I very happily hopped out of bed and it splattered all over the ground.  I looked so horrified my partner was laughing and gave me a hug to comfort me.  Usually he would rub me down with a come towel after but now...?
