Hello ladies,

I have been suffering through a breakup with a man I loved (still do love) more than I have ever loved anyone. We were in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half, he chose to end it as there appeared to be no way to close the distance anytime soon unless one of us gave up on our career goals. 

He is the most driven and ambitious person I have ever met (one of the many reasons he's amazing!) and he wasn't going to give up on his aspirations. I am currently pursuing a PhD in a field I love, but I have never felt as strongly about my professional goals as he does his. And in the back of my mind is the desire for marriage and family one day, which are things I deeply want and cherish.

So I am left wondering if I made a mistake in choosing to stay on a path that I have questioned in the past over following my heart and a relationship that brought me tremendous happiness and a man I love and could see myself being with long term.

Not sure if anyone can relate.
