Am I the only person that encounters this?  I realize that I'm not as flexible as I used to be, but damn.  I have a couple of pairs of shoes that have these super-tight buckles on the outside of my ankle.  I have to contort myself to reach them and it has actually caused pain remaining in that position for the length of time to put the damn shoes on.  

On the other hand, if the buckle were on the inside of my foot, I could quite easily cross my leg and put the shoe on.  Why isn't this the default?  Anther reason:  when I was younger and more flexible, I would sit with crossed legs on the floor comfortably, unless I wore sandles.  The buckle would dig into my ankle.  If it were on the inside of my foot, I wouldn't notice it.

So how did this happen?  why is the outside of the ankle the default?
