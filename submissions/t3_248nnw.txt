(thanks mods for letting me post this!)

After seeing far too many tales of horrible comments on the tech support sub, I've opened one for us -- /r/TwoXTech !  I am starting with a fairly modest goal, have a safe environment to ask tech questions, get support from your peers, ect.  I will do everything I can to make it a safe place to post your questions and get support, or even share your favorite tech stories and new media!  Hope to see you there!
