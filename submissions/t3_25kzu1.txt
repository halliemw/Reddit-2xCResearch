OMG rantâ€¦ My mother just told me I, word for bleeping word, "Need to get a boyfriend". WTF mom? Then she asked if she had offended me and could understand HOW she could POSSIBLY have done so.
I am a 22 y/o woman in school and with a full time job as a nanny. I struggle every day with my appearance- I'm not overweight, but my whole body is scarred from acne and self-harm. I can't leave the house without a full face of makeup for fear someone will see my scars. I'm also working my way through sobriety after many years of drinking just to be able to talk to people and overcome my social anxiety, stemming from childhood and increased exponentially after I was raped at 19. All of this she knows. I pretend to be confident when I'm in the outside world, but I cry all the time at home about how I'm failing life. And she tells me to get a boyfriend. The idea terrifies me, both because I have an incredibly hard time trusting men and because I can't let any man see what I really look like- I know they'll be cruel. I don't even know how to tell her just how deeply she stung me. I just want to crawl in a hole and die.
