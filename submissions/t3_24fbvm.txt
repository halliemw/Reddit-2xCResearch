Hi ladies! I'm hoping you can help me out with a bit of a sticky situation. I have a male coworker who I'm pretty friendly with. He will come by our department to chat with me and the other girls, we IM each other periodically using our work IM program, etc. But lately I feel like he's been amping up the interactions and getting increasingly flirty. The final straw was this IM from today:

"You are awesome, you make the days brighter and it's awesome getting to talk every day so thanks for always making time to"

Now, this is nice and all, and I feel sort of similarly (I like chatting with him throughout the day. As a FRIEND!) but it makes me a little uncomfortable. I have a serious boyfriend who I love a lot. And yes, I try to mention my bf a lot. I even offered to introduce them since they're both musicians! I'm not interested in my coworker in that way and I don't want to lead him on. My problem is that he could just be being friendly, and I don't want to be presumptuous and shoot him down when he's not trying to make a move. I also like talking to him and if we can maintain our friendship without the flirtiness I would prefer to. 

Have you ever had to deal with something similar? How do you tell someone to back off when you're not sure they're really hitting on you? Is a very direct approach called for in this situation? How can you phrase it to avoid as much awkwardness as possible? Thank you so much in advance. I know the ladies of TwoX are very wise! :)
