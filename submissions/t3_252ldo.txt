I'm not trolling or whatever I just had never heard of what is happening to me and wondered if anyone could tell me what is happening to my body.  So I grew breast very rapidly as a teenager going from flat to C cup in about a week and a half.  I figured that was just what happens.  Fast forward to my 20's and a small lump appears in my armpit.  Turns out it was more breast tissue looking for a place to grow.  Had it removed, moved on.  5 more years go by and a small lump appears in my vagina, I thought it was a cyst(obgyn said so) but after months and months of this lump getting bigger and harder I tried to pop it and found it to be solid.   Turns out it was more breast tissue.  My doctor seemed as surprised as I was and has little information as to what is happening or what will happen in the future.  Are there any other women out there with this problem? Am I some sort of boob mutant?  So now I am up to 36DD with two scars from having to remove breast tissue and my breast get bigger and more ridiculous every year.  If anyone knows anything about what is happening to me please share.
