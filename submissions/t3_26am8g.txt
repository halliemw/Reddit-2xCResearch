For the past couple weeks or so I've noticed that my vagina has a slight burning sensation, it feels like there's slight burning INSIDE of it. There is NO itching and I think it should be known that about 3 months ago I was diagnosed with chlamydia and BV and was treated with antibiotics and a vaginal gel. Well last month I noticed a fuck ton of whitish discharge and the same burning sensation so I went to tell my doctor and she believed it was again, BV. I'm worried and pretty annoyed with myself that I could have maybe possibly gotten chlamydia again because I recently had drunken sex with someone who told me they did NOT use protection. 


So my only complaint right now is my vagina has a burning sensation within it and for some odd reason it seems to be WORSE as soon as I wake up in the morning, this is when the burning is most apparent. As far as discharge goes, I haven't noticed any odd smells but I actually have noticed about a week ago an excess amount of it that feels really uncomfortable and exacerbated, like a gushing sensation of vaginal discharge from time to time. 


This is really embarrassing for me and I really would like some advice on this matter :( thanks.
