I am needing to come up with ideas for a gift basket that will be raffled off for charity. There aren't really any guidelines -- it is for work so has to be *somewhat* appropriate. I've got nothin! And I don't want to rehash the common baskets I've seen the last couple of years (spa days, Apple/Kindle products, roadtrip/Vegas themes). Any of you have any ideas?
