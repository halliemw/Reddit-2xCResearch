I've heard of menstrual cups a while ago but I was younger and my mother said no right away. I'm about to turn 20 and I realized that my mother no longer controls what goes in my vagina so I really want to look into switching. 

*The number one thing that pushed me to want them is they're more discreet. Basically my boyfriend (about to turn 22) still lives at home. We usually hang out in his basement because his mother feels that we shouldn't be alone together until we're married. There isn't a bathroom in his basement so I have to go upstairs to use the bathroom. You know girls clothes and pockets. I'm not good at hiding tampons in the waistband of my pants. So if his mom hears or sees me sneaking upstairs she'll ask what I'm doing, if I'm okay, if I'm hungry, and eventually she'll ask me what's in my hand. My boyfriend and I have been together a long time and we're in a very serious relationship and plan on getting married. I'd say I'm close to his mom but I still don't want to talk to her about my period. I know it's a stupid thing to be embarrassed about but I am. And let's not even talk about if his dad saw me! I think I'd run away crying. (I probably should mention I have anxiety. So I probably worry about this a lot more than I should.) My boyfriend is leaving for almost a month and I can't say goodbye because I won't go to his house when I'm on my period. That way probably too much back story. Sorry, I'm really upset that I'm not seeing him.* 

Anyways, on to my menstrual cup related questions! 

*Like I said I'm 19 about to turn 20. I've never had any children. So I'd assume I'd need a small one? But I've also read that "bigger" girls need bigger cups. I also heard how much you work out factors into it? I'm over 200lbs, probably over 230 and am around 5 feet 3 inches tall. I'm chubby but not too big. I don't work out much now because I hurt my back but I'm hoping to be able to go to the gym 5 times a week again soon. What size should I get? 

*I know there's multiple brands but the only one I know of that's available in the US is the Diva Cup. Is that a good choice? 

*I have terrible cramps and I heard using the Diva Cup can stop them? Is that true? Could this make cramps worse? 

*I read something somewhere about there being suction. Does it hurt? Because a suction cup sucking my cervix sounds painful. 

*What do you do when you go out and have to change it in a public restroom? Won't you have blood all over your hands when you walk out to the sink? 

*Do I have to change it every time I pee and poop? 

*The little stem you use to pull it out looks sharp and painful. Is it? 

*Can you feel it inside you?

*Honestly, how hard is it to get in and out? 

*I'm thinking about switching from the pill to an IUD. Should I not use a menstrual cup if I have an IUD? (That's what I read about when I read about the whole suction thing!) 

I did do my own research but I wanted to hear some personal experiences! 

Thanks in advance to everyone!
