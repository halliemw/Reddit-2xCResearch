I don't know when it started but I think I was around 12 when I started...um... shaving my chest and it's gotten worse. It's really embarrassing for me to talk about it with anyone and only my boyfriend knows about it but I think it's really noticeable, especially with most women's clothing having v-necks. The thing is that I shave my chest everyday with an electric razor (been doing this for about 9 years now, I'm 21) and it never gets all the hair off and I get a stubble every time with horrible razor burn that looks like acne. Is there another way I can go about this without having to use electrolysis, waxing, laser hair removal (too expensive) or shaving with a regular razor (don't want to accidentally cut myself and make it worse). I think the hairs are getting thicker and it's hard to tell which direction they're growing in. I don't know if I should try bleaching it. I've tried putting aloe vera on it after I shave but it doesn't work. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you. =(

Edit: Thank you so much for all of your feedback, I appreciate every single one of your comments and I apologize if I don't get back to all of you. For those of you who said I should talk to a doctor about Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, I've been to a gyno before and they said I was okay. I do have excess hair growth passed down genetically but my mom has never experienced hair on her chest before, only facial. I guess I should try talking to her about it (so embarrassed!). I told her I did it before when I was way younger and she yelled at me for it but since it's getting worse maybe I should tell her it's a problem.
