So a few months ago, back when I was in "relationship mode" I met a guy on POF and chatted, but never met.  Decided to stop talking to him because we wanted different things.

Fast forward to about a month ago.  I had just been laid off, was in hardcore "find a boyfriend not just a f-buddy" mode, and went out with a guy.  I made some bad calls (read: took him home the first night) and then spent way too much time with him in too short a space of time and got in this weird headspace around him.  Anywho, after nine days of feeling smothered and finally realizing that this guy was a stage five clinger and my weird headspaces were not my own anxiety but rather because my brain was trying to say "danger Will Robinson!! red flag red flag."

When I went to go meet him to "break up" with him in person (can you break up with someone after only 9 days?), he showed up wasted.  Like stumbling slurred words can't walk in a straight line wasted.  He called me a heartless c**t, and that I would be alone forever, was a "classic bitchy virgo."  Then he called me every 3 minutes until Verizon helped me block his number.  I had a full on anxiety attack, convinced that he would come to my house and harass my household, and all that (thankfully he did not and my roommates and call from my mama helped peel me off the ceiling).

Now I'm more in go-with-the-flow mode and have reconnected with POF guy.  He says he's cool with me going slow, which is nice.  We're playing pool this week. I'm truly awful at it but I think it's really fun.

I suppose my question (and my point) is wondering how to differentiate between being nervous after a bad experience and actual spidey sense red flags.  I want to give this POF a real chance, but I also don't want to not be careful.

Any of you had similar experiences? How do you get past it?
