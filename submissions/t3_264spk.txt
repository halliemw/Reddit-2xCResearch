At the beginning of the school year, my daughter was depressed, friendless, and felt bullied. Getting her out the door to school every day was a chore, because she felt like nobody liked her and that the teachers were out to make her life miserable. Through hard work, and a great therapist, in the past 9 months her attitude has completely changed. She has two amazing friends, a handful of acquaintances, the kids she had a problem with have since backed off, she's gone from C and D grades at school to all As, and her self-confidence is so amazing to see.

Just this week she took the plunge and told her best friend that she's bi. Until now it's been a subject my daughter has only felt comfortable telling a few family members about. Her friend didn't blink an eye over it, which gave my daughter a huge confidence boost.

It makes me so happy and proud to see the changes in her! I hope her life just keeps getting better and better, now that she realizes the world isn't out to get her.
