I was told that you guys have a great support system for victims of rape, so here goes nothing. 

I'm 15. I was raped 10 months ago, I now have a week old daughter as a result of that. My boyfriend is incredibly supportive and things have been getting a little better but some more support (maybe by people who have been through something similar) would be amazing. Thank you so much to anyone who comments on this or pms me.
