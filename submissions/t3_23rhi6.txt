Throwaway because I am paranoid. 

I am married and falling in love with a married man that I am speaking with online.  I live in a new country with my husband and I will not be able to see him, so I know nothing stupid will happen. We are just friends for now, but I have a feeling he feels the same, though neither of us have spoken about it.  We started just talking about normal things and it developed into talking about how our relationships are failing, depression and all sorts of things, though nothing that is inappropriate.   

I know the right thing to do is stop talking to him now, and I know I should see a counselor, but I really just want to hear from other women who have been in this situation and how it turned out, how you dealt with it emotionally.  I am so lost and can't give too much detail about my relationship with my husband.  

Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest.
