I am 20 years old and a virgin.  For the past several months I've been on numerous antibiotics because of an illness,  giving me chronic yeast infections.  Even before the illness (since about a year ago) I've had this ongoing pain/burning on the "bottom" of the inside of my vagina. Back then I had a great gynecologist and he was actually able to look inside (!!!) by using numbing gel and having the nurses hold my hand, yet he told me that nothing was wrong with me and that there was slight irritation. 

Then I moved and my current OBGYN (the nurse for the main OBGYN) is pretty good,  but I cannot have anyone examine me or stick the Q-tip in there because it causes me to have the worst pain imaginable.  I ALWAYS stick it in there myself.  I can stick things up there just fine but when someone else does it it's extremely painful. 

Then last week the nurse wasn't in so I had to see the regular OBGYN. He couldn't get the speculum in.  He touched me and it HURT, like there was a cut there.  Then he got very angry at me. We did a q-tip and he said nothing was wrong even though I'm in constant pain and feel discharge all the time. I think he might be lying to me because he said there was nothing he could do.

I'm supposed to see the nurse again tomorrow but I'm very scared. They won't use numbing gel or anything.  They use lube but it doesn't help.  My vagina is my enemy and it's so painful.  Can someone maybe help me out? I'm very scared it's going to hurt because I am in so much pain already. And I know I'm a huge baby and I'm an adult and too old to be scared.  I have a lot of problems that need to be sorted out but if someone could help me I'll be grateful.
