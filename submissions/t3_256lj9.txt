I get all this nasty dead skin gunk right in my nipples. It appears harmless but I find it nasty so I clean it out in the shower. It's like belly button lint for my nipples. Nipple lint. Or like the gross sleep grit you get around your eyes when you first wake up. Is this common? I have never managed to figure it out.

(Also I wanted to contribute to the ongoing TwoXGrossmosomes campaign.)
