I don't really have a family and they live across the country anyway. I had been planning to attend my graduation with my boyfriend, but as it gets closer I don't think I can handle being around that many people and their functional families. Mother's Day fucked me up pretty badly, I burst into tears at work yesterday because people kept talking about their moms and today I called in sick because I'm still too emotional.

I had wanted to go to the graduation ceremony for my BA because it's a big accomplishment for me - I dealt with being homeless, with a complete lack of financial support, with a lot of people telling me I couldn't do it, and no emotional support other than my boyfriend (soon-to-be fiance). I finished with a 3.91 GPA and a scholarship to an awesome grad program that I'm super excited about. I'm proud of myself and so is my boyfriend, but I think the grad ceremony will be too much of a reminder of the things I didn't have.

**I'd still like to mark the occasion in some sort of symbolic or ceremonial way, but I don't know how. What should I do?**
