So this is my second month of TriNessa, and I took the third placebo pill almost nine hours ago. My first period with TriNessa didn't start until the second placebo day, but I'd been spotting for the entire week before that. The period progressed.. somewhat normally. I've never seen myself drop so much clot stuff in one period, and it continued for three days after I started the second pack.

Now, I spotted a week and three days before I started the placebo pills. I am on the third placebo pill and I haven't even begun the slightest bit of normal bleeding. I've had all my usual symptoms, the weird cravings, the emotional sensitivity, and the hotflashes from hell, but no period. I haven't had any sex so I know for a fact that I'm not pregnant.

Is it normal to not have a period this many days into placebos while adjusting? What about the spotting going on for so long? Is my period still going to be the full seven days, or will it be cut short? And isn't birth control supposed to help regulate this? 

The spotting in the beginning occurs because that's when my period is supposed to be naturally. I have no idea why it continues after the placebos are done but it does. But anyway. I currently don't have a proper period.

The spotting content is also the dark discharge gunk.
