I'm 24 years old and only lost my virginity a few months ago.

It was through casual sex with a guy who is pretty much all about the sex. However, he's respectful, we have chemistry sexually and I wanted something casual myself. I waited a long time to lose it because the right person never came along and well, needs got in the way and I decided to just do it - and he was happy to offer to do the deed.

I never bled at all the first time. Guess years of sports/gymnastics/horseriding sorted that out!  I was so grateful. Beyond that, it was sort of painful. It was actually too painful for me to let him enter me missionary style so I laid on my stomach and that felt a lot better.

We recently started having sex again. In the break between us not sleeping together for a few months, I never slept with anyone else. Now, when we had sex again, once again, found it way too painful to have sex with him on top, missionary style but we persisted anyway because I wanted to.   After we were done, we noticed BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I guess I was in pain because well, it was hurting me! 

Also whilst we were having sex, he found it really difficult to get 'inside' because I was so tense. He kept asking me if I really did want to have sex because my body was so tense/unrelaxed, it was making him feel weird as I didn't seem to be into it at all. He said I was bad at sex or maybe we didn't fit.

The thing is, I WANTED the sex. Mentally, I wanted it! I find him incredibly attractive and I was comfortable with our casual arrangement. I don't understand how I was tense and why my vagina was acting like a chastity belt against itself!

I guess I'm not very sexually experienced, even at my age. I was raised in quite a religious environment and haven't really sexually explored much.  Is this normal? Are most women tense like this? Just looking to see if anyone can relate?

Thank you
