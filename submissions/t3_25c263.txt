I was curious to see what you would have to say about this, because I feel kinda torn.

I took on some extra responsibilities at work some time ago, but had been working part-time hours as I had other commitments. Long story short, things got too much and burning the candle at both ends left me exhausted. 

One morning my boss came into my office to talk about my performance. I just lost it and started sobbing, saying I was struggling to keep up. He offered me a significant raise to accept more hours and I was so shocked I couldn't say anything for a moment. I literally sat with tears running down my face, when he increased the offer yet again. I regain composure, thanked my boss. Told him I'd consider the offer, and accepted the next day.

He's very supportive and it wasn't a big deal. I'm not really embarrassed, but part of me realizes this is not usually how salary negotiations take place, and I feel like my emotions betrayed my gender's reputation in a way (the other part is like Zing! I got a raise!) Or is it totally fine to be honest and open in the workplace, even if it does mean displaying stereotypical vulnerability?
