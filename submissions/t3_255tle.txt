I thought of this last night after seeing that the sub was going to be a default and then seeing some of the posts made here.  Some posts seemed like they belonged in askwomen and/or askfeminists and perhaps consider adding something in the sidebar suggesting that questions about those things go to there.  The "what is feminism" post in particular stood out to me and I think there was one or two other opinion questions directed at women.

Maybe the community doesn't mind those kinds of questions, but they don't seem like what this sub is about.
