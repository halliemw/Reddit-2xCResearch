I'll be traveling alone in NYC (Manhattan) for a few days.  I'm worried about going into someone's private home, but I'm also on a really tight budget.  I'm reading as much as I can about Airbnb and the website mentions many times that it runs on trust (yikes).  Ladies, do you have any stories or tips you'd be willing to share regarding Airbnb especially in manhattan?
