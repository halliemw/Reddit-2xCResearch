Where I'll be living, mace/pepper spray and tasers are legal without any paperwork. I'll be living alone for a few months until my significant other moves from across country. I've had experiences where I've been in scary situations and would feel safer if I had a taser (I already have mace). My friends think I'm crazy. Does anyone have positive/negative experiences with tasers/stun guns? (Irrelevant, but my SO thinks it's a good idea too.)
