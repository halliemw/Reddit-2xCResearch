Thank you TwoXChromosomes for opening my eyes to the fact that women are just as peculiar as men but with a hell of a lot more to complain about in terms of bodily...functions. I am glad that I will never have to worry about keeping my tampon string clear of period shits. If it makes you feel any better, one time, when having a poo, my penis touched against the inside of a public toilet as I sat down.
