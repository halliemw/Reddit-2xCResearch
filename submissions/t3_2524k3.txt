Sorry if that came off as kind of "YOU'RE NOT MY MOM!!!!" inducing - but with all the negativity floating around, we've gotten some lovely new additions to our community. I just don't want to make them feel like they're getting lumped in with the ne'er-do-wells. 

I'm not totally on board with this (I LOVE YOU MODS, BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TRUST!!!!)... but I've met a couple of sweethearts already, so.... **Hi, nice-new-folks, and welcome. It's nice here, and we're happy to have you.** :)  

I've been trying to say as much in a couple of the smaller threads (and I think that's a good idea, to help bolster the positive atmosphere we all know and love), but thought maybe a post would help?
