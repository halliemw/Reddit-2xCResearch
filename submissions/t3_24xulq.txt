At his request, I started performing anal play on my BF. At first, the concept of it kinda freaked me out, but pretty much as soon as we started, the feelings went away. He loves it and I love him loving it. So my question: what are your thoughts on anal play with your partner? Stories, fears, beliefs, techniques? All are welcome.
