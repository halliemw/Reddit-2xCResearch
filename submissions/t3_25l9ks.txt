Mini rant here, but I'd love your advice.  Here's my scenario: been friends with a guy for a while, never was interested in that way.  Met a new girl and became friends with her, introduced her to him, and they hit it off.  She really wanted to date him, but he wasn't interested.  She had a hard time getting over it but now, she has moved on and happily has a new boyfriend - he's great.  Now, I'm living in the same city as original guy and we have developed a thing.  I told her this - before anything happened - and she flipped out.

Does she have a reason to be mad?  Is this breaking 'girl code'?  Because the way I see it, if she gets to be all happy and blissful with her new boyfriend, I should be able to have a shot at that happiness with somebody I like, too.  But maybe I'm out of line.. I could use some input!
