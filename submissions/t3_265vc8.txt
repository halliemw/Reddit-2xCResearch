I like my morning coffee because it makes you poop conveniently in the morning, and it feels good to have something warm in your stomach first thing in the morning.  The caffeine has never really woken me up or had much of an effect on me that way.


Now I'm taking Wellbutrin and I find that it gives me a headache in conjunction with caffeine.  So now I'm looking for a warm drink for the morning that isnt coffee, and something that induces the morning poop
