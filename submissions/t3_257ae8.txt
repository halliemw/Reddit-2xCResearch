 I spend two weeks a month, before my period, wanting to kill myself (suicidal ideation etc). I'm not the most positive person to begin with. 

I am in a strange place. I have never wanted to be a woman. I don't want to transition though. I just want these periods to stop and for the moods to be regulated. It's making me so unhappy and it's something beyond my physical control. Too depressed to exercise, eat healthy. And I've locked myself into a really shitty customer service job because I needed the money. It could be a lot worse but I'm thinking a few more weeks of this and I'll actually kill myself. 

I am in Singapore (if that helps). I don't know any docs specializing in this and I'm afraid I'd just get laughed at if I say I feel suicidal because of a period.
