Hello I'm a lurker and not sure if this is the correct place for this but I need some outside views. How do I handle this situation? What can I do about it?

My husband had his phone stolen recently and the new owner's SO decided to blow his FB up with naked photos of me. With the comment stating this is what happens when you cheat. And I can only assume that whoever posted these didn't realize that their SO had stolen the phone and never deleted the photos already on there or what. And maybe the new owner was cheating because there were pictures of other women as well. Though you would think that they would realize that they were on the wrong Facebook account.

 But I'm pretty much having an anxiety attack over this. And I know there isn't anything I can do about it. And that's pretty much the worse thing about this. Right along with knowing my SO's mom saw me naked....online. 

I can't imagine what was running through this person's head when they decided to post them. They don't even know who I am. And obviously they didn't confront their SO. 

How do I handle this gracefully? Can I even do that?
