I collect records, and have been for a few years. Nobody has a problem with it, every one encourages it. Except for a vast majority of male record store clerks.

 I don't know what it is, but they almost always assume that my purchases are for a male, or are my male companions. When I explain they are mine, I get a lot of comments like "Well, that's strange for a girl" or "You must be getting this for the cover art." Just what. I just want to purchase my vinyl without your petty sexist comments, ugh.

Edit:  fixed a typo!
