I'm happy for all of my you that have a wonderful mother in their life. You are very lucky, please cherish that bond you have. 
Not all of us had the chance to forge something similar.

This time of year can get a bit depressing with all the adverts and people talking about their wonderful mothers.  


Mine was not so great.  I have always wanted her to realize the mistake she made and see what she is missing out on.    This year,  I've given up on that.  I will be 29 soon.  My mother had me until I was 5 when CPS took me away and gave me to my dad.   I had step mothers but they didn't treat me all that great and it was never what I really wanted.  
Finally this year,  I think I have decided that I'm done pining for the idea that we will ever have a healthy relationship.    She has missed out on knowing someone I think is pretty awesome, so it's her loss.   


Anyway,   not trying to be sad or get pity -  I just wanted you all to know that if you have a relationship with your mother, you are very lucky <3
