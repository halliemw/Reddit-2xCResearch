Almost 3 months ago, I broke up with my long term boyfriend after he was arrested for assaulting me in front of a police officer (yes, shamefully that’s what it took for me to leave after years of abuse, but that’s another story). For the first few weeks I felt surprisingly good, but then reality kicked in and I began to feel the full impact of being alone. The court date is coming up and recently I’ve been feeling totally shitty, so yesterday in order to try and cheer myself up I got in the car and drove 100 miles to the beach, with the intention of having a nice long walk and then exploring a nearby town, which is the kind of thing I used to do with my ex all the time. It just wasn’t the same though, and after walking around on my own I ended up standing in the rain, staring into the sea and crying. I can’t shake the feeling that nothing is worth doing if I can’t share it with someone, and walking along the beach where everyone else was with a partner or a group of friends or even just a dog, made me feel 100 times more sad and alone.

The fact is, I have nobody to share things with or socialise with at the moment - I ended up very isolated in my relationship, my family are several hours drive away, I love my job but my colleagues are almost exclusively men who are old enough to be my father and I can’t get a dog because of my living situation. I’m working on meeting new people, but in the meantime I want to learn how to enjoy myself without feeling like I need somebody else to be there. I love exploring new places but the idea of doing it alone always seems to be so much better than the reality.
