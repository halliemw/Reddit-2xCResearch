Trigger warning: bulimia

So my boyfriend has bulimia. 

I don't know what to do, or how to talk about it with him. It's something I've tried talking to him before about, twice, and both times he told me that it was none of my business, essentially, and to ask him "in the morning."

But the thing is, that morning has come and passed several times now.

I haven't properly talked to him about it during waking hours, partly because I don't know what to say, and when I begin to speak, the words don't come out, and I'm not sure what to say, and I always cry.

He says don't worry about him, etc, but I just... I'm at a loss. Have you ladies dealt with this before? Do you have any advice? How to approach him, what to say to him, if anything at all. I really, really feel helpless, and I know it's his disorder, so it's personal... but at the same time, I hate when he eats because I know right afterward, about twenty to thirty minutes, he'll be in the bathroom for about an hour. 

It's like this huge weight on my chest, and I don't know what the fuck to do.

I'm so worried, and I was curious if any of you have dealt with this or are in a similar situation. 

What should I do?
How should I act?
How/What should I ask (if at all)?

Most importantly, if you have dealt with it, how did you manage? I'm so worried for him... I just... I love him, you know? I'm at a loss and I need advice.

Throw-away for obvious reasons (and a follow-up to another throw away question about this that I posted somewhere else and didn't write down the password/throw-away-name).
