I've never posted here, but didn't know where else to go for help. My girlfriend recently had an 8 day break during her birth control, since she accidentally took 2 pills on the same day in the last week. She's been taking the pill for years, I think 3 or 4. She finished the pack on Saturday and started on the next Monday, 8 days later. We then had sex on Tuesday, my main question is do you think emergency contraception is a good idea in this situation? What are the chances that she could be pregnant? Any and all answers and help are greatly appreciated
