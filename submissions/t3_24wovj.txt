Hi everyone, I'm looking for some guidance/constructive criticism (and hoping to avoid a flame war).

I help edit a blog for a local non-profit -- all bloggers are volunteers, including me, i.e., we're not all necessarily media-savvy pros. One of our writers put together a great post with advice for women going on vacation. However, there is one paragraph that is bothering me, but I'd like some input from other smart people before I go back to her with constructive criticism for how to change it.

She advises readers visiting other countries/cultures to avoid sexual assault by dressing in accordance with cultural norms and avoiding excessive drinking. I'm uncomfortable with those kinds of unqualified statements, as of course they can be interpreted as blaming the victim. I'm wondering if I should ask her to omit this paragraph completely, or if any of you think there are ways to advise women on ways to decrease their risk without entering victim-blaming territory.

I believe that the only people responsible for rape are rapists, but when we live in a world where most rapists are empowered by their surrounding culture to get away with their crimes, I think there must be ways to teach self-protection in ways that don't perpetuate these cultural structures.

Any insight would be appreciated!
