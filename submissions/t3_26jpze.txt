I'm 25, and my right breast feels swollen and a bit painful. Nothing major, but enough for me to notice. Actually both breasts have been feeling a little swollen and tender, but nothing major going on with the left one. 

The right one, however, feel strange. I feel some pain at times, and some itchiness that starts from the nipple and like extends to the middle of the breast. It's not like an external itch, it's strange.

Today I looked at my breasts in the mirror and the right one looks bigger. It has always been bigger than the left one. But now it looked slightly bigger. I asked my boyfriend if he had noticed this and he said he had noticed that my right breast had been feeling a little swollen.

I have a lump in that breast. I got it checked a while ago and they said it's a fibroadenoma, which is common a this age, and that it's benign and nothing. That I should get it checked out every 6 months or so. I have to get an appointment, but I'm scared.

I'm on birth control, but I've been on this pill for over a year already and this hadn't happened. Maybe I got sore breasts every once in a while... I had my period like 2 weeks ago, so it's not PMS (I've also never struggled with PMS), and to my knowledge I'm not pregnant (and it should be extremely difficult, since I take my pill religiously and I think I may have fertility issues due to insulin resistance).

What freaks me out the most is that my breast seems to have grown these last few days. I hope it's nothing, but I'm scared. Breast cancer doesn't run in the family, though some relatives have died of other types of cancer.
