Read another article about the lack of gender diversity in Internet businesses, few funds being made available to women's Internet profit ventures, and the dip in women computer programmers from 37% to 18%. The writer of the article attributed lessening women's participation on the Internet to hate speech and violent comments made against women Internet users at all levels of Internet participation. 

There are some days I really wish the gloves were off. Hateful, spiteful men send inappropriate and frightening messages to women whose views they disagree with and post women's addresses and contact information for the sole purpose of offline harassment. Editorials are being written and people are talking, but it *just doesn't end.*

I wish we could do *something* that would hurt, or even inconvenience, Internet misogynists. I wish we could set aside our standards and commitment to nonviolence and just *get on their level.*

Edit: it's been one hour and I've just received my first nasty PM citing the article with emails from the frat as American University that "feminist wonyn [sic]" shouldn't be "radiating smug cuntiness." Bravo!
