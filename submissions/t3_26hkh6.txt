Breaking out the throwaway for this one. (Because body issues, dude.)

I'm 18, so not quite in the middle of puberty anymore, but not quite past it just yet. While I know body acne is normal for teens, I get it in really weird places. The top of my thighs, the underside of my forearm, and even my armpit-area (outside of the place where my armpit hair grows) all get pimples quite frequently. 

I've heard of body acne on your butt, back, and chest but never on your arms or legs. Why in the world does my body think these are ideal places to sport some acne? It's just wonderful waking up and being like "Oh, would you look at that? A bright and shiny red spot on my arm. Great. "

Please tell me I'm not alone and that there's someone on this subreddit who understands how unique? this issue seems to be.
