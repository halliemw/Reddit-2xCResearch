I live in a city where violent rapes are more prevalent than ever. Two gang rapes have happened in the past three weeks within a mile of me and none of the attackers have been caught. 

Quite rightfully, I'm scared. I work predominantly at night and have to make my own way home via public transit. I have no one who can come to meet me and definitely cannot afford to take a taxi. I've been followed home, had someone attempt to assault me, been catcalled etc.

People of TwoX, what can I do to feel safe walking home at night? Pepper spray is illegal here. All I do is hold my keys in my hand and stay as vigilant as possible. I'm sick of feeling unsafe in my own area and need to reclaim a bit of power over this situation. 

Edit: to open this up a little, I'd appreciate if any of you have stories to share relating to this issue. I'm sure this happens everywhere.
