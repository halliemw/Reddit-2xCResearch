I own the apartment I've been living in for the past five years jointly with my parents. I live here alone (for the most part, see below) and I like it that way...We decided that it's time to cash in on the investment (Okay, they decided but I'm okay with it) and I happened to find an amazing, quirky loft space that I'm very excited about. It's only 15 minutes away by car, but that 15 minutes gives you a giant change - right now, I live in the middle of a major US city. My new apartment is just north of the city, in an...urban suburb (?). It has no buildings attached to it, it's on a busy road that doesn't lend itself to walking around (I have a car but have never relied on it for everything like I'm going to have to now). I have been able to walk 90 seconds outside my front door to go buy milk/cat food/toilet paper at 2am for the past 7 years. It's a big change. 

Being that I've lived in this busy (college kids, sports fans, marathon runners...) neighborhood for 7 years, I'm worried I'll become a shut-in or that my friends won't come to the new apartment or that it won't feel like home. 


I want a fresh start, and I'm ready for it - had two failed relationships (both of whom ended up moving in...), I got my Bachelor's and am 90% of the way done with my Master's, and it really is time to move on. 


What can I do to avoid having a panic attack (nothing like being **anxious** about an anxiety attack ahead of time...) when I'm sitting alone in my new apartment on Saturday night, and it's all unfamiliar?
