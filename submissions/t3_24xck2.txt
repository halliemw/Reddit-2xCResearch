I am sick of clicking on to TwoX and being hit in the face with pro-abortion or pro-choice submissions.


The description of TwoX the side bar says "Welcome to TwoXChromosomes, a subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and **intended for women's perspectives**."


Bearing that in mind, I have noticed that anyone submitting a pro-choice statement is pretty well left alone, or upvoted. 
Anyone submitting a pro-abortion statement is upvoted and supported, and anyone submitting an anti-abortion/pro-life statement is downvoted or receives backlash in comments.


Why is it OK to be pro-abortion and not pro-life in this sub? When did we decide that only one opinion could be had in TwoX? Isn't that what r/prolife and r/prochoice are for?
Is that the "perspective" we're supposed to have, abortion should be OK becuse I am a woman? That the choice not to agree with abortion is wrong, and goes against how we should feel as a woman?


And in regard to Emily Lett's video (the lady who filmed her abortion to show that it's not scary), I think that it sends a dangerous message. 


**While there are legitimate reasons for abortion** and it is much safer than it used to be, I think that this video sends the message that, "If you get pregnant by accident, having an abortion really isn't a big deal."


I feel that the focus should be on prevention rather than "dealing with" an unwanted pregnancy once it has occurred. As safe as abortions may be now, contraception is much safer, both physically and emotionally.

As much as we don't want abortion or unwanted pregnancy to affect our lives, and as much as we say it's our choice and noone else's, the fact remains that a pregnancy can affect others as well as yourself. If you are in a committed relationship, accidentally fall pregnant and don't want to keep it, there's a chance the woman's decision not to keep the fetus may be different to the man's opinion. And as much as it's YOUR body, it's HIS child too.


It oculd be that pro-choice is so massively supported in this sub because we feel that abortion is such an unpopular subject outside. In this day and age, while there is still a stigma attached to abortion, there is a lot of support for ladies who fall pregnant by accident.
We don't need to bash pro-life activists to support pro-choice. 

We have the choice to decide whether we do or do not want an abortion, and noone on this sub should be told they're wrong for not agreeing with someone else's choice. 

If a person can post about their pro-choice stance, a person should be able to post about their pro-life stance without facing backlash.
