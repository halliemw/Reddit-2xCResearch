(I'm a teenager.  This will be relevant.)  So today I went to the doctor and blah blah had to get a vaccine for something touch your toes check your blood pressure etc. and she had me fill out a "teen survey" that was basically checking for mental illness like depression/anxiety and also asking about sexual activity and exercise so that if I was sexually active, she could make sure I was properly educated about it.  She even did the thing where my mom had to leave the room so if I wanted to talk about birth control/personal stuff my mom wouldn't be there creeping on the conversation.  Overall I was just really impressed and thought that it was a step in the right direction for this generation, and that makes me hopeful and happy.  Have a nice day TwoX :)
