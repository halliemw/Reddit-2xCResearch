So, a guy I've worked with for about 6 years was arrested at the beginning of this week. The only official information that anyone knows is that he took a 14 year old girl shopping and wanted her to try on swimsuits, then took her to his apartment where he began to touch her after giving her some alcoholic drinks. She got uncomfortable and called her mom, and walked to a different location, and he texted her after she left saying "You need to call me, what happens next could be potentially very important." 

Now, this guy is 27 and has always been socially awkward, but overall liked among our coworkers and friends. I'm really bothered by everyone's reactions though. It seems like when it's come up, the majority of people agree that he shouldn't have touched her, but that she was probably asking for it, and she shouldn't have been hanging out with him, and that she shouldn't have been drinking etc. I feel bad for the guy, I do. But I don't feel that it's ok for justify that by blaming a child. And I'm becoming really disappointed with my circle of friends.
