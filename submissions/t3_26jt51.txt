I will be traveling around America, Canada, and Mexico this summer to random music and arts festivals, hiking and camping, and a bunch of other random places and events. I am female, and will be traveling mostly alone, or with my dog. I was hoping you gals (or guys) of 2X could give me travel ideas, gear suggestions, safety tips, and anything else y'all think a twenty year old single female should know about chasing adventure with nothing but a shitty truck and a good dog by her side?  :D
