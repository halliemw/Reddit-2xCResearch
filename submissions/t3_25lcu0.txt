Today my father took me to Costco to buy bikes for us.  He taught me to bike when I was four, and since then, things have been fine and dandy.  Well...today I learned that Costco has "girl bikes."  

Basically, "girl bikes" have a lower bar so that you can get your legs over the bike without making a large, swooping motion.  Whatever.  I thought the bike looked weird and I wanted the standard bike...which has now apparently become a "boy bike."

My dad pretty much insisted I take the girl bike.  When I asked why, he said it's easier to ride, as well as lighter.  So I proved to him I could lift the boy bike.  Then he said "no, take the girl bike.  You're a girl."  

We had a pretty loud debate about it in the middle of the bike aisle, and I eventually won out, insisting that I had a human body shape, two arms, and two legs, and could therefore ride either bike (they were the same price to, so I don't get the big fuss!).  

Now my dad keeps saying I'm going to regret my choice, and that the girl bike was made for riding with a skirt.  But I don't wear skirts!  And even if I did, why would I wear a skirt when I want to work out?

I'm really mad that my father tried to push a product on me just because I'm a girl and apparently can't operate anything other than girl-specific items.  It's dumb because I've been riding the "boy bike" since the early 90's!

I want equality for myself--to be seen as capable.  I accept that society can dish out some nasty sexism, but I didn't expect it to find it so close to home.  Doesn't my father want the world to see his daughter as strong and independent?

**TL;DR: My father thinks I should use products made for my gender ONLY, and that I should consider products made for men as off limits.**
