I'm going to the doctor next week for what I'm pretty sure is just a cyst. However it's on my mons so I assume the doctor might just do a pelvic exam of some sort. I've never had none before so I was wondering what I should expect. Also, would be best for me to shave or not? I usually don't and I know that has a doctor she's used to pubic hair but I was just wondering.

Thanks in advance!
