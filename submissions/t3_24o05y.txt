I know there is an r/gradschool but it seems devoid of any sense of humor, so I'm posting here instead and hoping some of you ladies can relate or provide some relief, comic or otherwise.

I am in the middle of writing my application essay/Letter of Intent for a graduate program, and I've been working on it now for... over two weeks. It's a two page essay. Every time I go to write, I freeze. I know this is the right program for me, I'm pretty sure this is the right school for me (and there aren't many options for me to choose from anyway), and I know it is definitely something I want to pursue. Why am I having such a hard time with this? I almost feel.. undeserving? I don't know. I am in a constant state of anxiety/panic. I have taken care of just about every other part of the application, this is pretty much all that is left (and waiting on recommendation letters).

I think some of the trouble I may be having is that, with undergraduate applications, it was like "ok here pick a topic, write about it," whereas now I am being given a set of questions to answer in letter form. I have tried to answer them each individually, but can't seem to make it "flow" in any logical way or connect them into one coherent piece of writing, the "write a thesis statement" approach doesn't seem to apply either. Additionally, a lot of my drive for wanting to pursue this program is from life experience, rather than my undergraduate education, but they clearly do not want my cheesy little life story and I don't want to bullshit this essay because this is really important to me.

Perhaps you ladies can provide some advice? Or at least tell me I am not alone in that I'm kinda freaking out here. Thanks for letting me rant either way.

Here are the questions I've been asked to answer: (I don't even understand what the last question means)

* Why are you seeking a Masterâ€™s in Health Administration?

* Why have you chosen [University]?

* How does your previous degree(s) prepare you for a career in health administration?

* How does your previous work experience prepare you for a career in health administration?

* What is your ultimate career goal?

* What are your strengths and weaknesses?

* What do you determine to be your legacy?
