Seriously, the only thing that even remotely hurts is the tender spot on my arm from the IV.  Nothing else.  I had prepared myself for the worst of the worst...I'm so confused.  I know they DID do it, but it feels like they DIDN'T.  Amnesia from the meds?  I'm Superwoman?  What?  Huh? 

**EDIT** I also realized there's no way I could ever do anything but the Pill and maybe the Nuva Ring.  How do you IUD ladies DO IT???
