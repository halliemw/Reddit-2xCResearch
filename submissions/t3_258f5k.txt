I had labiaplasty 4 days ago and am worried about the healing process. I have a follow up appointment in 3 days.

At the moment I am still quite swollen, both minora and majora, there is very little bleeding, occasionally a small amount after urinating and drying myself, some itchiness but barely any pain. My main concern is what seems to puss seeping from the areas that were trimmed.
Being such a precious area I am not sure if I am over reacting or if this is a sign of infection and that I should get to my surgeon earlier than already booked.
I am also curious as to whether I should be showering yet as some testimonials I have read say that they were showering a day after surgery, whereas others recommend not until 10 days! I showered yesterday but the amount of puss has increased since then.
I am currently taking Diclofenacnatrium and Paracetamol for the pain.
