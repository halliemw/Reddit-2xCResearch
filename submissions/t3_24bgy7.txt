I work in IT (in an office where I am the only female). I occasionally go on sales calls with either of my managers to potential clients. Today, one of my managers was going to meet a potential new client, and I offered to go with him. At this point, I was told that I "couldn't go" because the potential client was a strip club. I said I was fine with going. I really don't care, and I do want to get more sales experience, which is an area I feel like I want to improve in. I was told that it was not an option for me to go and that they would just take another of my male coworkers instead. 

Am I taking this too seriously? I was really pissed off. It would be one thing if they were uncomfortable asking me to go, but forbidding me from going is entirely another issue.
