I've had steel toes ever since I entered the workforce, first in the oilfields, then in construction work, and finally I've newly entered the mining field. This required moving from Sacramento, CA to an active mining town in eastern Nevada.

Now, underground mining workers are required to get a specific type of steel toe rated for underground work. And yesterday, I went out to buy a pair.

I went from store, to store, to store. No one, and I mean *no one*, had those types of steel toes in a small enough size. Apparently no one has informed the boot industry that women are going underground yet! Finally, I found a pair in men's size 6...still a bit large, but close enough.

[Here they are!](http://i.imgur.com/ZAgaxXU.jpg) I think they look pretty badass. What can I say? I just love to brag about a good purchase of shoes.
