Hey all,

Concerned boyfriend here. My girlfriend keeps hearing from her friends about diet pills, and she wants to try. I am a really skeptical person and have to have all the information before I make any health decisions. I want to support her to lose weight, but I want to steer her to lose it in natural ways (proper diet, exercise) as much as possible.

She wants me to support her to take the diet pills, but from the information I've gleaned from the internet - they have a lot of nasty side effects, and make you lose good fats and water content in your body as much as bad fats.

So I want to know your experience of any good information you guys might have on it. So I can make a somewhat informed decision whether to support her or steer her clear and put a lot more energy into getting her on the right track lifestyle way.

Now I should note she also plans to change her diet and get exercise, but wants to use diet pills as kind of a boost for weight loss. She doesn't want to lose so much just 5-8kg.

Anything you can help me with, even anecdote will be helpful, thanks!
