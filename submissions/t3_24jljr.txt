I know this seems a bit out of place but I figured you ladies would support me in my emotional moment. I recently got a bike for my birthday and I've been getting so into it, riding trails with my boyfriend and even biking to school. I really enjoy it and I hoped it would help me get more exercise. 

I've only had it for a month and I walk outside this morning and it has been stolen from my apartment's bike rack. I'm a complete mess. I know it seems silly, but I'm just so heartbroken. I can't afford one like that again so soon and I don't know what to think. I can't bring myself to go down and inspect where it was locked up but it must have been my fault. 

I'm just crying and so heartbroken, what have you ladies done in this situation? Or any links/advice/comments to just help me cheer up a bit?
