Hi 2X. I need help. How do you help/handle your friends when they're in the middle of a break up? No the weeks/months following where you're supportive and nice, but the day of. The messy sobbing and rationalizing and begging the dick face to come back. 
I just got home from my best friend's apartment. Tonight her guy left after getting into some sort of screaming fight and took all of his things with him. I came over to be nice while she cried. Despite the fact that her break ups are always like this, I'm still not sure how to handle them or what to do.
