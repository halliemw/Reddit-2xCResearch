I apologize if this is better suited somewhere else...

Has anyone poked themselves in their eye with mascara?? I did the other day (of course after my make up was all down, mascara was the finishing touch!). I had to rinse out my eye and hold a towel to it for a good twenty minutes before it stopped watering and I felt good enough to open it.

It hurt so bad! I never knew makeup would hurt me like that. I feel betrayed. Anyway, since then my eye keeps feeling like there is something in it. I assume maybe I scratched something? Has this happened to anyone else. I didn't go to the doctors or anything, I thought I was OK but it's kind of bothering me. How long does it take to heal?

And for the record, I do not wear contacts.
