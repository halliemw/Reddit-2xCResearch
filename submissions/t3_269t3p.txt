My parents LOVE kids. Like, really, really love kids. They raised 12 kids (no we're not catholic) and although they aren't actively anti-abortion, their feelings are made apparent in their actions.

My sister got pregnant at a bad time in her life. She loves kids and wants a family - but she also wants to go to grad school and the dad wasn't in the picture. Wrong guy, wrong time. It was still a VERY hard decision for her.

Now that she's had the abortion, the whole thing is *very hush-hush*. Only talked about in whispers - always danced around in conversation. My sister recently brought up not doing grad school because of the expense and time. My mother said **'then it would all be for nothing'**.

It was meant to be encouraging but my sister didn't take it that way. As if my she owes the world something because the abortion. She has to live in this child's shadow for the rest of her life? Not to mention how no one can talk about it without whispering and acting like it was this big tragedy. 

She's having a had time dealing with her decision and they want to help, but I feel like they're going about it the wrong way. She knows it was the right decision for her, but that doesn't make it easy.

My sister and I are driving up to visit my parents tomorrow. I would love to talk to her about it on the long car ride but I really don't know how to approach it or even if she wants to talk about it - she's so ashamed. I just want to help.
