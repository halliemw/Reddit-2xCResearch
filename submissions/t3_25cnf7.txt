Ive been told that I'm extremely pretty for my whole life. I"ve never had good self esteem though, and I am beginning to fear aging.  I want to gain self esteem and am trying to to just that. So would it be better for my psyche to tell myself that I am some sort of fabulous and beautiful  badass, or should I tell myself that looks dont matter?
