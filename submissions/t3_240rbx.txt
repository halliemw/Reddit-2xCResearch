I am 20 years old and currently on the Progesterone only pill (Cerazette) and am unable to take any pills containing the hormone Oestrogen as it raises my blood pressure too high.

But I hate the progesterone pill I am on at the moment! It is seriously effecting my relationship with my boyfriend due to it's side effects (it makes me very dry down there and lowers my sex drive!) 

I have set up an appointment with my GP to discuss getting an IUD fitted, but I wanted some advice from real women rather than listen to someone who perhaps may have never personally had the device fitted. One of my main concerns (which may be stupid) is that I have recently started weightlifting and am frightened that squats and deadlifts might dislodge the IUD as I've heard they do move tampons! 

Also on the NHS website it says the procedure is quite painful, and I'm a big wuss! 

Any advice would be amazing from all you lovely ladies! Thank you :)
