Long story short: an arsonist went around my neighborhood setting things on fire, including my car, which was a total loss. I was out of town when it happened so I only saw the aftermath - I didn't actually witness the fire or anything. They have the guy on a home security camera setting another fire and at least one witness who saw him in the vicinity of my burning car. He also lives less than a block away from me (though I don't remember seeing him around, I don't have much interaction with the neighbors).

I've read through the subpoena a bunch of times and it seems pretty straightforward - show up, get called, answer questions. But I get super duper nervous talking in front of more than like 5 people, and when I get nervous I start to ramble, and apparently you're not supposed to do that in court. And I guess the defense is allowed to ask me questions as well, which isn't what I expected.

Obviously it's been a rough week for me, and this whole witness thing is adding an edge of anxiety that's really hard to handle. I'm hoping someone can share their experience to take some of the fear out of this.

Edit: I am in Oregon in case that makes a difference with regards to procedure.
