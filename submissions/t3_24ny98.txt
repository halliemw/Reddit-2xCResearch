Tomorrow I am going to a pre-wedding celebration. I am very close to the bride's family, and they asked me (and my family) to wear white. 

Unfortunately, I got my period today. I was planning on wearing white pants with a nice blouse because I don't have much 'dressy' clothes that are white to begin with.

Has anyone else had this dilemma? What did you ladies decide to go with (tampons, pads, diva cups)? I don't really have time/money to go out and buy something new, but I do have pads, tampons, and panty liners on hand. Thank you for any advice/suggestions!
