I picked this tea up at Whole Foods a while back and never really drank more than a couple cups from it. It's Orange Ginger Mint from The Republic of Tea. It comes in a cylinder and markets for around $10-$12. Looks like this:

I decided to make a cup this morning after reading that citrus, mint, AND ginger have properties that alleviate cramping and bloating. I thought to myself "I have all of that in a tea!". Made a cup and within a few minutes, I felt relief. It's been 30 minutes now and I feel fresh and pain-free. (I think we can all relate to that glowing feeling we get after the cramps subside. Best feeling ever.)


Anyone else have luck with this tea or another remedy to share?
