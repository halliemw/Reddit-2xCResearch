Since being made a default sub TwoX has devolved into blatant sexism and just general immaturity. Is this honestly what the majority of you folks are going for? Go to any length to get rid of every single male viewer?

I've been lurking, enjoying, and occasionally commenting on TwoX for years. This used to be a great sub, and it is not the outsiders that have destroyed it over being "defaulted". This sub is self-destructing.

I just hope everyone is being introspective before they post the content that is flooding TwoX. Is this what you want your sub to be? All in the name of being reactionary over its visibility and availability?

I honestly just don't get it. For years I saw a group of redditors who gathered together on this sub and found strength. Now it seems to be full of redditors falling apart in the face of (what they see as) adversity. This is not strength I see.

**Edit**: for example, check to see how many of the FP posts over the past week break, or at least skirt, your own sidebar guidelines.
