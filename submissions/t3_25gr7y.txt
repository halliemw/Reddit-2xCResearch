I forget the exact results, I think it was [Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US)](http://www.bidmc.org/YourHealth/Health-Notes/WomensHealth/ScreeningsProcedures/Understanding-Abnormal-Pap-Test-Results.aspx).  Her HPV test also came back positive.  She declined a follow up colposcopy.

She has stated that this is the 'single hardest thing she has ever gone through in her life'.  She feels shame, anger, distrust, unworthiness.  She feels like she fucked up.  She feels like the Western Medical system is *not* set up to make people healthy, but to make people feel like there are things wrong with them.  The doctor does not feel like a safe place to her.  It has taken a toll on our sex-life, we have had sex maybe a half-dozen times since her result a year ago.

Now, a year later, I encourage her to *at least* go get another Pap.  I know that they are uncomfortable tests, and that I cannot really know that discomfort.  I know that she feels shame, and that I cannot really know that shame.  I worry about her health.  I feel uncomfortable not knowing what is going on with her body.  I feel bad for pressuring her to do something that she does not want to do, for asking her to do something with her body that she is not comfortable with.  I feel like her behavior is self-destructive.  I feel like I should have encouraged her to get another Pap six months ago.

Why did I post here?  I wanted to talk to someone about this. I wanted to hear others' opinions or related experiences.  I wanted to get different points of view on what I might do going forward.
