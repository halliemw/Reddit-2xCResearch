So I am 26 and had a pap in 2011-3 years ago, and by most information I am finding, I am reading that it would mean I am due for one. When I went to Planned Parenthood a year ago, they said that I was due for one even though it had only been two years...and then when I did get my pap smear that doctor told me it was every 3, which is why last year, it didn't make sense to me. 

Last week, I went to a different doctor in urgent care because I was afraid I had strep throat (I didn't) and the doctor mentioned pap smears and she just outright asked if I get pap smears and I said yes and she said, "Every three years OR every five if it's normal." I had a normal pap in 2011, have not changed sexual partners (have only ever had one) so I'm wondering if what the most recent doctor said is correct. I'm only reading every 5 years for women over the age of 30. 

Does anyone know if every 5 years if it's normal for women my age is a new thing? I have an appointment for a birth control consult to get my rx refilled, but not to get a pap or exam and when I made the appointment, no one told me that I was due for it. If it truly is 3 years then I might want to change my appointment so I can take care of everything all at once and not have to come back, but if its every 5 years now with normal paps, I'd really like to not have to go in yet, because no one likes pap smears!!! 

If they tell me at my appointment that I am due for one, I suppose I could just ask them about the 5 year thing, and if I am in fact due for one then I guess I'll just come back sometime this summer.
