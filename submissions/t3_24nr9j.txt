And I am not ok. I never thought I'd be the girl who would wallow in a breakup. I never thought I'd be the girl who relied on Ben and Jerry. 

It was a total blindside. I had just fallen in love. And he realized that he still loved his ex girlfriend... the girl he said it would never work with. I had gone to his house to comfort him after a bad day. And he referred to our relationship with the word "was". I asked "So is our relationship in the past then?" All he said was "yes, I'm sorry."

Never have I been so happy to be the 24 year old living with her mother. I walked in at 10 at night in tears and told her what happened. She took care of me until I was ready to watch the new Big Bang Theory (priorities).

Its been 3 days. I'm still depressed. I still cry when I think about him. I hate this and needed to talk to some ladies. I am independent. I was emotionally abused by my father my whole life. I'm getting a master's degree. I am overcoming an anxiety disorder. I'm stronger than this. Why cant I get over it?
