Not sure exactly how to explain it. It is coming from the left side of my vaginal wall and it bulges out and feels like it is a sac filled with fluid. When I stand up or go pee it literally feels like it is coming out, but when I am laying down I can barely tell it is there. I can squish it with my finger and can even make it go away if I push it back to where it comes out of it that makes sense. I noticed a while back that I had a soft spot on that side of my vagina and never thought anything of it but I just noticed this weekend that it literally is almost coming out. I just had a baby in February and I suspect that has something to do with it. I am gonna call my OB/GYN on Tuesday since they are closed tomorrow. Does anyone have any clue what this is? I thought maybe it was a rectocele or cystocele but it isn't coming from the top or the bottom it is on the left wall. I have no pain with it or discomfort. It only bothers me that it feels like it is coming out. Especially if I cough or sneeze. I don't have any problems peeing and I don't pee on myself or have extreme urgency or anything like that. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
