So I've been masturbating since I was very young : using hands, faucet, jacuzzi, improvised electric shaver etc. I get creative when I'm horny. 

Finally, as an adult, my bf went down on me. And it felt good. But not AMAZING like all the videos I've watched have led me to believe. I didn't even finish. 

Is this because I've been doing it to myself for 10+ years? Have I become desensitized? I really hope not. 

Do you have any advice? I am super sensitive right on my clitoris to the point that it is uncomfortable. But around it feels better. I was really looking forward to this and now I'm worried it will never feel great.
