I see a lot of people quoting rape statistics; unreported, going to trial, false accusations, etc. Stupidly I never bookmarked any I came across.

Could anyone point me in the right direction? I'm not expecting to have my hand held, I just don't know where to start. (Is RAINN a good example?)

Thanks!
