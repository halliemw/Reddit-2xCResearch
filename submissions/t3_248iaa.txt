My friend, lets call her Abby, keeps going back to the ultimate douchebag, lets call him Chris. Both are Seniors in high school. Chris has verbally and physically abused her, he choked her a few months back and wouldn't let her leave his house during a fight. They were constantly breaking up and getting back together, He cheated on her and everything. 

Well finally Abby seemed like she got some sense into herself and broke up with him and didn't get back together with him for a while. She started talking to other guys and it seemed all dandy. Well prom comes around, and she apparently makes a promise to him that she will go with him. He's begging her to take him back and that he's changed (which he ALWAYS does). Now, a few days after prom they are officially together again. I'm so sick of it I told her I was done trying to convince her to not be with him.

 I'm so frustrated because I care about her, and I don't want this guy ruining her. I know it's her life and her decisions. And I guess this is more of a rant rather than asking for actual advice, but if you have any advice that'd be nice!
