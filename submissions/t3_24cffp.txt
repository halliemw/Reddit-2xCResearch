I am a 31-yr-old single female without children and I was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of cervical cancer. In less than two days I will undergo a radical hysterectomy in an attempt to remove my cancer without the need for chemo and radiation after the fact fingers crossed
I have been overwhelmed by the number of people that have shown support for me during what is, to date, the hardest thing I've ever been through. I've never felt so loved in my life and if nothing else, I'm determined that this experience will have a positive impact on my world-view and my self-worth.
However, I'm amazed by the number of friends (usually female friends) whose first concern has been for my ability to bear children. Will I lose that ability? Yes. However, I'm trying to focus on not dying right now...and last time I checked, my value as a human being didn't hinge on my ability to breed. That said, many women value that function much more than I do (and I have certainly grieved over the fact that this decision has been taken from me) I just feel like there are bigger challenges ahead and what good is the ability to make babies if I'm not here to raise them?
Anyway, I wanted to share my story/rant a bit and hopefully help other women realize that we are worth more than our ability to reproduce.
Also, please remind the women in your life that, regardless of what the government advises, yearly Pap tests are so, so, so important. Get them. The five minutes of awkward can save your life.
