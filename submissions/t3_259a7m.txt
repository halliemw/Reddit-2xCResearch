For the past couple of weeks, I've had several signs of being pregnant...getting sick, sore boobs, being exhausted,  and being extremely irritated to name a few. I started what I thought was my period a few days late, but it was super short and super light. Just wondered if yall know if it's possible to get your period (or something like it) but be pregnant.
