Does anyone else get very frustrated in searching for a Pill that will work for them? I've tried to research what is out there and available for years, but all I ever find is each pharma co's website. I really would love to see a site that has all of the brands that are currently available and reviews from women that have been on them. 

I'm perimenopausal now and never married/no kids. I'm hitting online dating hard. The last two pills I tried to be on (because I was seeing someone exclusively) made me stupid tired during the day to the point that I needed to nap at like noon. I was on Depo in my late 20s/early 30s and loved it but my GYN took me off and I am scared to try it again based on reaction from the pill.

In pre-ACA days, I remember asking my insurance provider for a list of what birth control they covered. Nope, they don't have that and wouldn't provide it. I had to research what was out there, then contact them to see if it was covered. If it was a name brand and not generic then I was paying more or they wouldn't cover at all. So now under ACA it all should be covered, but i would like to have more info from other women before I ask my GYN for a script. I know, all of our bodies react differently tho
