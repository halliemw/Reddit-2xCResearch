If this is an entirely inappropriate post, just let me know... but I'm trying find a book for my sister.

My sister is graduating high school and I want to get a her a great gift, a book she can read and reread for a long time. We haven't always been close, but I know she's not much into literature. I want to share my love of lit with her, and I thought a good book would do it. She's heading off to college at the end of Summer.

She doesn't have any books in her room at my Dad's, but I saw on Facebook that she likes the Hunger Games series. I'd like to find something with a strong female lead, something with a protagonist she can identify with, and maybe learn something from. Above all though, I need an accessible book. My girlfriend recommended not getting something like Jane Eyre, since it's a pretty dry read.

Personally, I'm very into Fantasy and American Literature. I'm just not sure if that's what she'd like, but I'm open to any and everything (Especially if there's a chance we can discuss and bond over the book).

Any suggestions?
