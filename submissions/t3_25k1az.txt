Intellectual: links/text posts commenting on the state of women in the profession;
Practical: links/text posts relating to nuts and bolts of practicing law as a women (think salary comparisons, job descriptions, interviewing, networking);

Etc.
This is NOT a good place to seek legal advice. Absolutely nothing you read here should be construed as legal advice. Posts soliciting or giving legal advice will be deleted. Seek /r/legaladvice if you must, but know that there is no substitute for your own attorney.
