I've been seeing my boyfriend for a few months, and I just have not been happy. I feel like I can't trust him sexually, I have a really hard time opening up and communicating with him, and I am finding myself just becoming bitter and resentful. He's not necessarily a bad guy, and I know he cares about me, but I don't think it's fair to continue this when I don't see a future. I feel like a total asshole and I just haven't been able to find the right time or words to end it. Any advice? 

Oh, and throwaway account, for obvious reasons.
