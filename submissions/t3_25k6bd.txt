I've referred to myself as Ms rather than Miss or Mrs since I was sixteen. I've ticked this box on all the forms that ask about my information regarding bills and whatnot. Despite this the vast majority insist on referring to me as Miss, some do not even bother to ask a preferred title. I find this really infuriating and disrespectful. Does anyone else have this problem?
