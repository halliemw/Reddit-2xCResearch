Hello TwoX, I come to you because I am immensely confused (and when I came to r/relationships a couple weeks ago with my confusion they just shouted me down). Do I have relationship/engagement anxiety?

Short version of my problem: A couple weeks ago, when I was aware my boyfriend of four years would propose in a matter of days and we were going to close on a house, I broke up with him because I was experiencing serious doubts about marrying him. I can't quite pinpoint why - we're best friends who love each other, we make each other happy, he's a great guy, we resolve conflict well, etc. But this doubt was overwhelming. I felt like I was walking to my doom. Suddenly, after talking about marriage for over a year, I was the opposite of excited to marry him - my insides were screaming at me not to do it, and I'd look at my guy and feel like he was the wrong person, somehow. So I broke it off and told him he wasn't the guy I wanted to marry.

Two weeks out from that, I'm not sure why I did it. I don't exactly want to go rushing back to him - I feel like the doubt would still be there. I did some internet research and read about 'engagement anxiety' and wondered if that could be a factor. The site 'Conscious Transitions' by Sheryl Paul keeps popping up in my search: http://conscious-transitions.com/category/weddingmarriage-transition/

Married ladies, did you have serious doubts before your wedding? How did that pan out? Is it really true that everyone should be glowing through their whole engagement?
