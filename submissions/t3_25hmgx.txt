I am a PhD student at a large university. This most recent semester, I was enrolled in a small physiology course with an older (65+) male professor who made several remarks that I found very upsetting. When referencing the ovaries, he would often make remarks such as "this is where progesterone is made - which is why women are so crazy," and when referencing the uterus, he once said "we can tell by the immune infiltration here that most women must be lying about menstrual pain." He would frequently make remarks along the lines of "this discovery was actually made by a woman!" and "some women don't like my class because they say it's too early, and disrupts their beauty sleep." 

I was going to write all of these things in his course evaluation, but I became intimidated because the evaluations were due before we got our final grades, and it is a VERY small class. However, all of the things he said (those listed above are just a few examples) have really been bothering me lately. The lab I work in is on the same floor as this professor, so I'm not sure if it's worth confronting at all. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Or have any advice?

UPDATE: thank you everyone for the advice and discussion! It's validating to hear (especially from other professors!) that the situation is not ok. I like the idea of going to the department's chair to have a discussion about it. I am also actually considering starting off with an honest conversation with the professor himself to address a few of the comments. 

Side note: please stop PMing me telling me to "get over it or don't get a PhD."
