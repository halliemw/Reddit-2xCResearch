I'm going to see a doctor next week about some pain I've been having during sex (as well as some other stuff, I kinda save up everything that's wrong with me and then let it all out at once), but I really don't know how to bring it up and let her know exactly what's wrong while giving her minimal information about what I'm actually doing in the sack. 

Basically my issue is that initial penetration (of anything, even fingers) feels too tight, regardless of my arousal or whether we're using lube, and in any position other than me on top feels like somethings being hit that shouldn't be. 

Is that ok? Know anyway to make it less embarrassing?
