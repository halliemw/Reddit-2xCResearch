I'm mortified. I've caught a terrible chest cold and needed to go the pharmacy for some cough syrup. Since it's a terrible day it would only make sense that I'd start my period, so I put in my Diva Cup and went to go wait in line for my codeine cough syrup. 

Well, I'm coughing uncontrollably and all of a sudden I feel my Diva Cup moving. I can't stop myself from coughing so now I'm trying to not attract attention (impossible when you sound like you have TB) and putting my hands in my jeans pocket so that every time I cough I can push the stem back up. It was halfway out of my body while I waited for the pharmacist. 

It's too vulgar to tell anyone. Just you guys.
