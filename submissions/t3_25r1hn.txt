I (23F) am attending the wedding of a formerly very close female friend next month.  We used to spend a ton of time together, but haven't been in a lot of contact since she moved a few years ago, though we catch up occasionally.

The wedding is in our mutual home town.  I currently live with my boyfriend (she is aware that we cohabitate, though they have never met).  Upon receiving the invitation, I noticed it was addressed only to me.  The RSVP card has a single, long line (long enough for multiple names) and boxes beneath to check whether or not you will be attending.

So my question is whether or not I should ask if my boyfriend is also welcome to attend, or is that rude?  We live together and are contemplating marriage, so it isn't as if he is just a fling I want to bring on a whim.  It doesn't really matter either way I suppose, but I don't want to be the only person sans-date because I assumed I didn't have a plus one.

What is the polite thing to do in this situation?  Attend solo?
