Because this is intolerable. Fuck the mods. They knew exactly what was going to happen, and just went along with the admins plot to obliterate our subreddit and everything good about it to have a token women's default and a bit of PR. 

And now, *they are actively suppressing internal dissent by deleting posts that express concern!* **We can't link to anything in this thread without it being deleted by the mods due to their interpretation of rule 2**, so I can't post the removed thread here, but I know it was called "Sorry TwoX, I no longer feel safe posting here", and was at 60 or so up votes and 40 or so comments at the time of its deletion. I know that's how a lot of us feel, but we can't discuss it, because it was deleted by mods.

So /u/leedlebug [-2] [-1], how does it feel to betray your trusting community for someone else's gain, Judas?

And fuck the admins too. If they don't want Reddit to be stereotyped as a racist, sexist shithole, then they should have banned creepshots before it blew up. They're not fooling anyone with this; everyone knows they don't give a shit about users or public responsibility.

Anyway, I'm done with this bullshit. Down to business: Where's the new TwoX going to be? The problem is that most of the other general fem-centric subs like femmit and 2Xlite have been inactive for a while.
