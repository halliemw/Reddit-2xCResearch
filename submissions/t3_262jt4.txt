I have an appointment to have a surgical abortion this Friday. I am 7 weeks pregnant and this would be my 4th child. I'm a full time college student, not working, and currently depending on welfare and my boyfriend to support myself and my children. There is such a stigma attached to people who have children while on welfare. I haven't been on it for a long time, less than a year. I had a good job as an LVN but I was laid off while pregnant with my 3rd child and decided that it would make more sense to just go back and get my BSN even if it meant being poor for three years. My youngest is only a year old and we were very careful about using protection because we both decided that we did not want another child. I don't think it would be fair to my other children since having another child while not working would take away from what little I have to currently offer them. I don't want to kill my child, but I also don't think I could raise another one. Adoption is out of the question since my oldest two are 8 and 5. My boyfriend says that he'll support what ever choice I make but I know that he does not want to have another child. I haven't told my family or my friends because I feel ashamed for getting pregnant in the first place and for not being excited about it. I've had no where to vent and this decision has sucked the life out of me and sent me into a bit of a depression. Thanks for listening.
