I'm 15 and have been having irregular periods since I started, when I was 11. I rarely have a normal scheduled period. My last cycle, according to my period tracker, was 50 days. I've read that it's normal to have cycles up to 40 days, but I'm not sure about 50. I'm of average weight and I'm not stressed out or anything. I sleep a normal amount of time. My periods are quite painful, though, the first two days making me usually miss school. If anyone could offer any insight, I'd be grateful! Thanks.
