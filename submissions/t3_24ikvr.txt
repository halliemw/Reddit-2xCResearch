Hello lovelies!

I'm curious to hear from you ladies on my latest conundrum. I am currently taking BC pills and have been for almost 15yrs. As of late, I'm having some issues with my hormone levels (mood swings, dead libido, migraines, hot/cold flashes, worsened cramps and bleeding, etc) and am curious to see what you all have to say. I'm interested in trying out other forms of hormonal therapy/BC, but am wanting to move away from the pills. I was wondering what your experiences have been for anyone that has tried any other forms out there?

I haven't talked with my gyn yet, just trying to research at the moment. Thanks!
