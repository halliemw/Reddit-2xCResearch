I'm 24, had my first pap smear nearly two Fridays ago (May 2). I'm not currently sexually active, but have an LDR, so sometimes I am. I didn't lose my virginity till I was 22, and had an STD test a year ago saying that I was clean. I just had another test during my yearly physical, which came back normal. My primary doc also tested my blood, cholesterol, kidneys etc and they came back normal.

So, today (May 14, a week and a half later) my doc leaves me a voicemail saying that my results came back abnormal and she wants to discuss them with me. Of course, I immediately start crying and get anxiety. My mom told me she'd had one before, along with her sisters, and that they had this freeze thing and cleared off the bad cells, and all was good.

From what I'm reading, abnormal results aren't uncommon, especially in younger girls. Many said they had another test done, some a biopsy, the freeze test etc, and had checkups every 6 months until all was normal. The problem is I'm leaving for an 11-month teaching job in Colombia in about 6 weeks. I will have health insurance down there, so if anything I could see a Colombian doctor to have the test done, or fly back home during my school break which is around the 6-month time...

I'll be able to call her tomorrow. But until then, who else has had an abnormal result, especially in your 20s? What happened?

PS I'm not sure if this will change anything, but I'd had my period end about for or five days prior, and was stressed during the exam as it was my first one.
