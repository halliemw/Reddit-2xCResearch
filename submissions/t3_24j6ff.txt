My husband and I married right out of undergrad. We had our first son when I was 24 and just finishing my MBA. I had a degree in marketing and him in finance so we always assumed he would be the main breadwinner. I moved to support him and our son while he finished his MBA and I got pregnant again. While on maternity leave I got my dream job offer and my career has taken off over the last year.

We hit a crossroad where both of us were working and commuting a lot. I also travel for work. We knew our family needed a change. Yesterday my husband accepted a job for slightly less pay and less benefits that has him off every other Friday and 5 minutes from the boys schools instead of an hour. He told me the family's best bet is on me and he wants me to focus on work at work and less on household logistics.

I am so humbled by his choice to put our family first and put action behind his words of support. I really have no words to describe what this means to me. It is hard to be away from the kids for work, but knowing they have an active and loving dad to take my place at home is what makes it bearable.

Just thought you guys would understand!

Edit: I showed this and all the responses to my husband because he was sad about leaving his last job. He was floored and touched and read every response below.  We are both incredibly humbled by everyone's thoughts, kind wishes, and own stories.
