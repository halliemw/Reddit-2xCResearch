I'm so shaken up right now and I don't know what to do. I am a little stressed out from finals so I tried to smoke pot out in the field. I have never smoked on my campus before and I therefore do not know people who smoke at my school. So, when a guy came up to me and asked me to sit with him and his friend, I enthusiastically agreed because naive me wanted to make friends. He said that he wasn't smoking because he got in trouble with the school.

He started touching me on my arm and one arm hugging me. He told me that he and his friend were from Mongolia and lived in a dormitory that has lots of transfer students. I asked him if he was a transfer student as well. He said that he and his friend were. When we sat down, he started touching my leg, slowly making it up my thigh. High me kind of noticed it, but still kept talking to him. He asked me if I had a boyfriend,  I said yes and that it was long-distance. He said, "So he isn't here." His friend sniggered and I said, "Well yeah."

In that moment, I realized how huge he was. He looked about six feet and three inches, and I am 5'2". He reached out and grabbed the back of my head. I froze. 

"So you won't mind if I do this?" He forcefully tried to kiss me while his hand went to my crotch, but never made it because I stood up. I said I had to leave and I bolted out of there. If there wasn't this event going on near by with about fifty people, I don't think I would have been able to leave. 

TwoX I don't know what to do. I'm still really high and I think he might have lied to me about all this information. I do want to tell someone, but I smoked pot on campus. I really want to do something political with my life, so I don't want the fact that I got high to ever get on a police report.
