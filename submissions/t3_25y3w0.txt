Fundamentally it's meant to be about having faith in a person making an argument, that he or she aren't making any sweeping generalizations. And it's about posts that derail that argument by talking about anecdotes or a unique account of an event. But I don't feel like it's used that way in practice.

Oftentimes, when people say "not all men" they're responding to a post that comes off as though it stereotypes men. It's not a statement about one or two men who don't fit the description - it's a statement about men in general, and it's backlash against a post that seems to marginalize significant groups of men by talking in apparent universals.

I think the latter case is justified. If someone makes a post that talks about "men", unqualified, it's their responsibility to make sure it's understood if and when they're referring only to a -particular- group of men. And if they weren't sensitive enough with their language (and this is something one needs to be extra-sensitive about), they shouldn't get to balk at someone who criticizes either the tone of their post or the message about men that it seems to imply. 

In practice, with the rising popularity of this meme, I think people are getting too eager to call someone out on a "not all men" argument, and they don't bother making the distinction between the latter and the former. So a post that comes off as legitimately insensitive gets defended by it just as well. And I just don't think this is the way to go, especially not if someone hopes to buy both genders' mutual understanding.

What do you think?
