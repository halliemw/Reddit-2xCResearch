I am a 24 year old single mom. My son, my beautiful brilliant son, is three. I live with his alcoholic father and his paternal grandparents.

I work 38.5 hours a week, I'm in school and I suffer from severe emotional issues. I'm in a dead end job, barely making enough to support us, and beyond a roof over our heads and occasional babysitting, I have no familial support.

I love my son. It breaks my heart that I can't provide for him the way I feel I should. I am always so exhausted. I read to him, I play with him, but I'm definitely not entirely enthusiastic about it. I try to be, I really try.

I feel like I've hit a brick wall. I want to do better, but I'm not sure how I physically can. 

Occasionally, I go to my sort of significant other's apartment for the night. I put my son to sleep and go, leaving him under the supervision of his grandparents and his dad. I feel better the next day, until everyone tells me that it makes me such a neglecting mother. I have a hard time sleeping or eating because I am so stressed about money and time and how all of this will affect my son.


I don't know what to do. The only time I get any rest is when I'm not home. I want to break the cycle and be a good mom, but I feel utterly useless and hopelessly stuck.

Has any one else felt this way? What should I do?
