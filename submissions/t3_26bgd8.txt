Title says it all. My boyfriend of nearly two years who I thought I was going to marry ended things this morning. We live together, so I don't know how things are going to go until our lease is up. I would go into the story of what happened, but it's pretty long ... right now I just need words of encouragement and some virtual hugs. Anything of that nature would be appreciated. Thanks ...
