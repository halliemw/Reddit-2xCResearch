For the past couple of days I have had slight pinching pain on my left side. It is sort of near my hip bone. It really isn't painful, just annoying. It has been about two weeks since my last period. This week I have noticed after a bowel movement I have had clear, stretchy discharge. I figured I was getting ready to ovulate. Is this pinching sensation normal during ovulation?
