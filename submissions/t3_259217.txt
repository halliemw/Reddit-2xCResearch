This is a new experience for me, and I just wanted to share. I kept reading online about the virtues of this stuff, and decided to give it a go to help my fine, easy-to-break hair, and to see what else I can use it for. 

I bought some unrefined coconut oil (which I think is right) and slathered about 2 tablespoons over my scalp and hair. I didn't melt it first, but warmed it up in my hands until it was nice and soft. My hair is currently wrapped up in an old T-shirt, as instructed by the internet. Why an old T-shirt? I've no idea. 

I've read that I can use coconut oil in smoothies, and on my skin. Anyone else have experience with that? If my skin is prone to acne, will using the coconut oil make the acne worse?

Thanks all for your time, and I hope your weekend is better than average.
