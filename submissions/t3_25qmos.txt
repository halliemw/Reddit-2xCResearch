I'm ashamed to admit that I have been taking birth control for almost 10 years and it is only NOW occurring to me that I should have investigated side effects of prolonged use. Now that I'm older and considering children in the next few years, I worry that taking birth control for so long will somehow complicate my body's natural process. Any insight?
