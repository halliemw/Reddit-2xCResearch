Doing this on a throw-away account because I'm a wussy and don't want this on my real account.  
  
I'm working at my first full time line cook position since graduating from culinary school. But I'm having some real problems with my male coworkers.  
**Back story, skip if you like.**  
The place that I work at is about six months old now. In fact, I helped open the kitchen. It was me and one other guy and together we worked out creating recipes, where equipment should be placed, what needed to be ordered, what responsibilities were to be given to who, all sorts of stuff. So maybe calling me a "line cook" is a little weak, because I do a lot to keep that kitchen organized and functional. Even to the point of telling my boss what product to order for the next day, keeping track of inventory, as well as a key-holder. (should also mention there are no managers, no executive chefs, just employees and my boss. It's a pretty self-governed work environment).  
The coworker I started with ended up quitting our very first Friday. Couldn't handle the pressure I guess. Since him leaving we've hired two additional line cooks, a prep cook and a dishwasher. To my surprise, the number of women in the kitchen is slightly more than men. There is me, our prep cook and one of the line cooks. My problem lies with the male line cook, and his friend/roommate who we hired as our dishwasher.  
Both of them were hired maybe three or four weeks after I began. I am technically the senior of the kitchen, if even by a few weeks. I am the only one there who had any part in the initial opening of this restaurant as far as back of house goes.  
**Okay. Back story over. Here it goes...**   
Despite my seniority in the kitchen my two coworkers seem to have no respect for me. Basically they see me as a female, not as a coworker. Both of them have what they call "baby mommas", meaning women they are no longer with but share children with. Both of them think they have women aaallllll figured out, simply because they have what sound like some pretty rotten "baby mommas". I can't seem to get them to realize that while they may have *one* type of woman figured out, they do not have *all* women figured out. I can't bring up a single reasonable concern about work without them excusing it as me just doing what women do: complain. I've have even approached them about not treating me so differently because of my gender, but it's the same thing.  
I am frustrated, and I don't know what to do. I have worked in all-male kitchens before, but never have I been treated this insignificantly. My physical strength may not be on par with them, but other than that I consider myself a hard working asset to the restaurant. I'm tired of being punished for their bad choices in women. I don't consider myself to be your average female line cook as far as personality goes. A lot of women I was in college with were real fierce and tough, practically "one of the guys". That's not me. I don't like aggression, and conflict makes me nervous. I don't have the line cook attitude, but I can tell I have some talent in this field. That's why I stay. How can I assert myself as someone who deserves respect from my coworkers that see me only as a woman in a kitchen?  
  
Should also mention that my boss is a total doormat who *also* hates conflict. To the point where if a customer has a complaint and demands to speak to someone in charge, he sends one of us out instead while he hides in the back. I don't think going to him about this problem will solve anything.
