I'd love to hear what /r/TwoXchromosomes think. Basically the situation is the Women's Campaign have pressured the student union into hosting consent workshops. Feminist stories have been met with criticism in the comments section of the student newspaper, The Tab. So I decided to write this.

**The FemiNazis are getting us to do consent workshops now.**


**Hostility to feminism is unfortunately popular in Cambridge.** But the cries of “Feminazi” are sadly ironic, because this is not a women’s issue. Stanley Milgram used his famous social experiment to suggest that Nazi officers were not warped people: they were normal people who committed evil because of the urge in every human being to follow social convention. With this in mind, a perspective needs to be shared. Lad culture threatens to blur the line between social convention and assault. It is men, not feminists, who must confront this head on.


**But why are these workshops needed in the first place?** Do people really believe all men are lecherous perverts who need a good talking to in order to keep their man parts tucked in? Well, no. And hopefully the Women’s Campaign doesn’t either. The aims of this are to tackle lad culture, and stop victim blaming. Legitimate goals with legitimate reasons for pursuing. Firstly, victim blaming is rife. Remarks such as, “People drink themselves into these situations,” and “It sounds like she was definitely kissing back,” are not uncommon, especially on the Tab. Even if these viewpoints are valid in some situations, they’re not going to help us deal with sexual violence. That much should be obvious. Remarks such as “Why did he do that?” “Why do so many men think this is acceptable behaviour?” “Why do men keep abusing women?” These are the questions that will get us somewhere. And it needs to be men asking other men. We need unabusive men to challenge their friends when they say something misogynistic. Instead of laughing along, shouldn’t we oppose it? Shouldn’t we say, “Hey that could be my sister you’re talking about. I don’t appreciate it?” Only when men lose social status amongst their friends for being misogynistic will we start to see meaningful progress. Only then will the harm of lad culture have ended.


**And let’s be clear: lad culture is pernicious because it has arisen out of a desire for social status.** It plays on men’s insecurities and doubts about relationships and popularity. It is not the twisted reality of a parallel universe where Robin Thicke is Equality minister and Katie Hopkins is Women of the Year. It is the logical conclusion of an ever pervasive (and quite wrong) belief that girls are not interested in meek, accommodating, “nice” men. That lacking sexual experience is tantamount to being a social outcast. That in order to be sexually successful you have to be a “dick.” The past articles on the Tab on lad culture and assault have illustrated these situations are rarely clear-cut. Questions such as “If she’s coming home with me, does she want me to make a move?” and “How drunk is too drunk?” have no one-word answer for all women. To some people (for reasons beyond my comprehension), drunk one-night stands are something to choose, want, and enjoy. They might be a small minority, but they exist. But for others who do not give their consent, it can be unacceptable and traumatic to even try. This highlights that a judgement call is needed. In that grey area, lad culture encourages men to make their decisions based on the likelihood of sexual and social gain instead of the wishes of the people involved. When men get these decisions wrong, that’s when assault happens. To address this, men must learn to be conscious of consent as much as their social status.


**But you might still be wondering why these workshops are to be compulsory.** I believe the answer is simple. This is not an issue about being sensitive to the “plight of women,” stuck between the oppression of a male dominated society and the patronising goodwill of some sympathetic male protectors. This is a leadership issue. When a public figure is found guilty of sexual assault, they don’t need to be more sympathetic to women. They need leadership training. They have failed in their leadership. Although by this point it’s already too late; they also probably need to go to jail.


In Cambridge of all places, the leaders of tomorrow should understand that consent is the foundation of our non-Nazi society, and that challenging social convention is vital to this. I do not know whether these consent classes will be any good, but I do think I understand something about why they’re needed. It’s our responsibility as men to support them.
