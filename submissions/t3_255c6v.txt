To start things off: this place seems pretty awesome. Being the incredibly manly man I am (i have like, 8 chest hairs- envy of all my friends) I can't say I relate to everything posted, but still I love that this is here, and I plan on recommending it to my friends of the female persuasion. 

However, I'm seeing a LOT about how making this a default has 'ruined' the community and safety of the place. Because this is the internet. and people are asshats on the internet. 

So here I am, as a fairly average normal guy who is pretty upset about how this seemingly awesome place is being ruined by douche-bags, and I'd like to know: What can I (and people like me) do to help? I mean, I am refraining from being a misogynist jerkoff when I'm here, but since i do that everyday anyhow, that's not that hard, and it probably isn't helping a whole lot. 

Can I do anything here? Or should I just resign myself to sitting back and praying that God smite internet douchebags (probably killing off most of the civilized population as result)?

I'm basically just saying here- making this place default brought a whole lot of new people in, and a lot of them are horrible people making it worse. I just wanted to let you guys know that others came in, some not so bad, and they'd probably like to help if they could.
