The job is for a community education presenter, so I need to create a presentation to demonstrate my public speaking ability. The mission statement for the organization that runs the shelter is:

>provide comprehensive services to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and their families, conduct public information and educational activities, and foster social and systems change to eliminate personal and institutional gender-based violence.


The presentation can be on any topic I want. I was wondering if there was anyone here who maybe works or volunteers in a domestic violence shelter or similar organization who can suggest some topics that aren't as cliche as rambling off statistics. Maybe a new or not-that-talked-about trend with regards to this particular field?

Of course, I will be doing research on my own, but any links to suggested topics to start me off would be great!
