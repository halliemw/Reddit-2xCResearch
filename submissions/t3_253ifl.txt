A very religious friend of mine posted a status about virginity and sex. At first, I was almost surprised that I agreed with him (he's VERY religious), but then, I think, the sentiment went downhill. I felt compelled to post a response, and I'd love to here what you guys think about the topic. It seems like something a lot of people have been discussing lately, and its definitely worth the discussion.
