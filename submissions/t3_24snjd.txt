Hi ladies. Throwaway account. Not sure if this is the right place, but I could really use some advice. Apologies in advance if this gets kind of long. 

I'm 24. I got married last May at 23. My husband and I dated on and off since high school, with a 2-year break from each other during college. We got together in the summer of 2010 after I broke up with a verbally abusive ex, and we started living with each other almost immediately. In 2012, we decided to move across the country together. Two months after moving, he proposed. 

Now, two weeks shy of a year into our marriage, he's thrown a complete curveball at me. He claims it's a quarter-life crisis, and though I kind of feel like that term is a bit silly, I would have to agree. Here's the situation:

Two months ago, he quit his high-intensity job with an abusive boss to work for a non-profit at a much slower pace and a much nicer boss. His high-intensity job was the first job he got when we moved out here, and for a long time, he was making it his life goal to climb the ranks, make a lot of money and earn a six figure salary by the time he was 30. After quitting, he had a moment of clarity where he realized how incredibly unhappy he'd been over the past two years at his old job. He realized that he hadn't taken any time to develop himself as a person, or to work on developing his relationship with me. 

Three weeks ago, pretty much out of the blue, he told me that he was taking a step back to re-evaluate his life, and that he was going to start doing things just for himself to find out what makes him happy. I was fine with that--I encouraged him to find the things in life that would make him happy. But he started to get distant. He started to act annoyed by me. He started treating me like an annoying girlfriend. When I started talking with him about our relationship, he confessed that he felt that he wasn't sure where I was going to fit into his new identity, and that he had started to question every decision that he'd made in the past five years. He told me that he felt like I was too indecisive, like half a person, and that he needed me to work on myself while he worked on himself. That he needed distance. 

He started contemplating buying a motorcycle. He started going out with friends and not coming back home until 2 AM. If I cried out of sadness or confusion, he would get angry with me for "making it a tragedy." I recently quit my own job and found a new one at a place I love, and instead of feeling celebrated, it felt kind of blase. If I try to be intimate with him, sexually or not, he pulls away because he claims that he's not used to me being intimate, and that it feels fake. He's told me that he isn't sure if he was actually ready to be married. He tells me he wishes we spent more time dating and living separately. This, after 4 years of commitment and love and growth together. And then, in the middle of the night, he'll cuddle up to me and say he's sorry, tell me that he needs me and that he loves me. Then, the next day, he's got his walls up again. 

No, we've never had a perfect relationship, and we've had our fair share of fights, but right now, it feels like he's negating everything we've built together because he's not sure what to do with himself. He's really confused and I'm getting pulled along for the ride. 

He and I decided--together--to go minimalist, and we've cleared out our apartment and donated 80% of our belongings. Now I'm sitting in our nearly empty apartment, glad that I've decluttered my life, but sad that it had to get to that point in the first place. And I don't know what to do. 

I love this man. I've loved him since I was 17. We may have been bad in the past at maintaining our own separate identities outside of the relationship, but we've got a very solid identity together, and it feels like over the past couple of weeks he's quite abruptly ripped himself out of that identity and out of the life we've built together. Although in the past week his mood has been better, and he seems like he's starting to calm down, I know we're not at the end. 

One thing I forgot to mention is that, at a young age, my husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He was on very heavy medication from age 13 until about 19, when he decided one day to just stop taking it. Fortunately, he made it through without any complications, and has been mostly stable over the past 5 or 6 years, but I feel like it's something he still grapples with, and it may be part of this recent upheaval. Like he had been coasting along in a somewhat depressed state for a long time, doing a good job of either hiding or disguising it and just recently, something switched the mania on. 

I love him to death and would never hold his diagnosis against him, but it's been hard to watch and deal with, and I don't know how to bring up the possibility to him that his disorder may have been triggered and is now fueling this fire, especially since it hasn't really been part of our conversations with one another for the past 4 years.

TwoX, I don't know if any of this really makes sense, but I'm feeling kind of desperate here, and I could use some advice. How do I handle this? How can I help him without seeming pushy? What can I do to make our first anniversary special, even if he is going through an identity crisis period? Some days I feel like more of a grown up than others, but when it comes to this, I just feel young, stupid and clueless. Sometimes, the amount of sadness I feel is overwhelming, and even though I'm working on building friendships outside of my marriage, I feel like I've got very few people with whom I can talk about all this. 

**TL;DR:** Husband recently found himself in a period of identity crisis, and has since ripped himself out of our mutual identity. He has a history of bipolar disorder and I'm curious if this may be a sign of mania. Lost and clueless; looking for advice. 

**edit:** spelling

**edit edit:** So I wanted to thank everyone for their input, advice, etc. I guess my fear that his BPD may be the culprit is more realistic than I realized. I sat him down last night and talked with him about what I've been seeing in him, how it makes me feel, and suggested that he talk to a therapist or see his doctor. He wasn't gung-ho about the idea that his BPD may be rearing its head again but I feel like our talk got him thinking pretty seriously about seeking therapy. So, thanks again everyone. Your comments really pushed me to realize that this situation is beyond my control.
