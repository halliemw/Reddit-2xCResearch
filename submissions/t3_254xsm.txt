Maybe I'm taking the situation wrong, and if so forgive me. The way I read it is that purposefully 'TMI' posts are being created and upvoted as a means to drive out unwanted viewers who show up due to our new default status. And I don't really get it. I'm tired of the ONLY 2X posts I see focusing on the most irritating and to my mind least interesting/enlightening/thought provoking aspects of womanhood. 

Let me be clear. I absolutely think women should be able to post those topics and frankly find the TMI designation unnecessary in a community devoted to females and female topics. But it all feels really contrived right now. And it shows only an extremely limited side of our community. And it doesn't make me feel supported, intellectually stimulated, or empowered. It just makes me feel annoyed. I joined this community because I wanted to connect with other women, not because I need to talk about my period clots more. I am a much more interesting, rich, complex being than my menstruation details. 

I don't value purposefully alienating people just because they are new. I don't value cultural sequestration. It seems like we've taken drastic measures even before opening up to potential new and valuable members. 

Anyway, those are just my thoughts.
