Honestly though, very glad to be done. This was a very stressful Masters program that has constantly been reinvented and retooled (AT GREAT PERIL TO US GRADUATE STUDENTS). More than anything, I've learned how to be graceful (and cry at home in a bubble bath while listening to Journey ballads) under pressure and appreciate the good people around me instead of the negative and unprofessional sorts.

Cheers all around to the other graduates/certification-test-passers :)
