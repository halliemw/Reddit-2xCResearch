It is so frustrating and painful. Almost every time I have sex, the next day or a couple days later, I get that all too familiar stinging feeling when I pee and a constant pain in my UT. I always make sure everything is totally clean beforehand, both for me and him, but there seems to be no effect. The only thing is that I don't pee after sex. Don't get me wrong, I always get up and try, but the thing is... I don't understand how other girls do it? I can't have sex with a full bladder because that would be unenjoyable and uncomfortable for me, so I pee before sex. But my bladder doesn't just magically fill up within 20-30 minutes so I can pee again right after sex? And all the instructions always say to pee before AND after but I don't think that's physically possible for me. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I've had problems with UTIs all my life and had them constantly as a pre-teen and teen even before I started a sex life. Back then I even went on a preventative medication for 6 months which eventually did stop the UTIs from coming for years, until I started having sex. But I don't want to go on this medication again because I suffered a lot of hair loss from it and I have very fine, thin hair as it is. This was over 10 years ago (I'm now 23).

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the advice! I'm going to try adding cranberry juice and cranberry tablets to my daily diet, as well as drinking lots of water right before sex so I can pee afterwards. Hopefully this will solve it! If not, I guess I will have to look into medication again :(
