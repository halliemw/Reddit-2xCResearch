Hi all. I'm posting this in Two-X because I really struggle to make female friends, and I'm starting to think that I'm just a boring person. I just moved to a new city for work and while I seem to have great interactions in the office, I can't seem to make any real friendships.

I can't see anything blatantly awkward that I do or say. I recognize social cues (I think?), I'm kind and thoughtful. I get very good reviews from clients and higher-ups at work. But when I interact with women coworkers outside of work I feel like an outcast. The other women just have some kind of connection that I don't seem to have. They text each other funny gossipy things and they don't include me. Even when I get invited to go out with them it constantly seems like there is some kind of joke I'm not in on. And it's not just because I'm the new girl - there are several other new women employees and they seemed to fit right in!

The only thing I can really nail down in all of this is that I'm boring. These other women see each other and have tons of energy. They scream and laugh and tease each other and generally have a great night out on the town. I find myself sitting quietly and listening. I contribute to conversation but I'm not the life of the party. I just don't understand how to connect. What am I doing wrong? Am I just paranoid?

Maybe this isn't enough information to go off, but I don't even know what questions to ask. I thought if someone else had a similar experience to me or one of the "life of the party" girls they could give some insight. I'm just terrified of living in this big city and being alone every day and night. Please help!
