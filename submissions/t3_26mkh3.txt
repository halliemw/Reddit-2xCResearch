Hey. I had an experience way back dating a girl and i had no idea
she had been a victim of sexual abuse and when we got to sex she was
really shaky and scared and i could not understand why (we were already in a relationship 
and she wanted this but obviously could not handle it) i did not force anything
but i felt really bad when she told me what happened to her a couple of days after we had our first time together. I can only say i understand it but i cannot say i know what it is like.
I'm not sure if the world is more open now or if i'm openning my eyes to the cruelty that goes around but the fact is i know a lot of women who had suffered abused and i feel terrible about it being a man. i do what i can being respectful regardless of genre as i expect from everyone. The fact is that i'm in love with a girl who i have much in common with, we play music together, discuss world views, drinki together etc... and she recently told me she also had suffered sexual abuse in the past but did not detail it
and obviously i did not ask it. I don't ever want to cause discomfort or pain or any kind of negative impact on this woman. How am i supposed to act regarding this? i dont ever want her to get me wrong, we see each other a lot like 3 times a week (we're just friends) and i end up flirting sometimes but i don't ever want to cross the line. Aside from the obvious what should i do to make sure i'm not being an asshole?
