Pregnancy: black iron suppliment shits, constipation followed by shitting Coke cans, constantly leaking urine, stinging nipples, baby kicking my cervix, cankles, and sausage fingers.

Birth: Two c-sections here, not much to report. Except for the fact that my husband put a picture on FaceBook which showed my catheter bag. Oh my *god.* It was hilarious, but I have too many older rellies on FaceBook to leave it up. One of my friends commented 'I hope that is orange juice!' and I literally pissed myself. Fucking bladder.

**Edit:** thanks for the gold. Whoever is gilding these TMI threads is awesome :)

**Another edit:** LOL someone is down-voting comments in this thread. Aww, how edgy!
