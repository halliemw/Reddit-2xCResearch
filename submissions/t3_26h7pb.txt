I'm going to see my OB GYN in a few days, but I just wanted to share a little bit of how quirky my body is acting and if anybody might have anything to comment on.

I am about two weeks late on my period. I've been sleeping very irregularly and I've had this very hot feeling in my pelvic area and I've been urinating really clear and frequently the past few days. I have been drinking quite a bit of water but I always have and my urine hasn't always been so crystal clear so consistently. I'm thinking.. Something is up! ;)

BUT! My breasts aren't tender to the touch at all, I haven't experienced any slight bit of nausea. And I have taken 5 pregnancy tests in the span of 3 days all in my AM right when I wake up and they have all come out negative. 4 were dollar store brands and one is an e.g.t brand.

I'm a little confused. If I'm not pregnant, what are these weird symptoms and where is my period?! I have a sneaking suspicion I probably am, but at the same time it doesn't seem very likely.
