I recently stopped taking my birth control, about 2 weeks ago because I couldn't afford it, anyways after my period was over I was still having cramps, even now almost 2 weeks later. My vagina is itchy from being dry, at first I thought it was a yeast infection but wasnt terribly itchy or had weird discharge. It's effecting me terribly mentally and I've been having trouble getting wet. It's painful near the entrance of my vagina causing sex to be too painful. My vagina seems weird now, especially the dryness
