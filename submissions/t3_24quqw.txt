I was thinking about this because I had to convince my provider to prescribe me a certain BC pill that wasn't the one she routinely gave out (that I chose based on the ingredients being similar to a previous drug I'd taken and had no side effects to). 

I was reading about the different options and I noticed something. No company will ever admit to women that their drug can cause weight gain, but many birth control pills will list change in appetite as a side effect. Just like a decrease in appetite can result in weight loss, an increase in appetite can result in weight gain, yet I read these complete denials everywhere. It seems insulting. As if they're saying "oh, sure, this pill could *possibly* make you feel strangely hungry all the time and unsatiated after you eat, but if you gain weight it's not because of this pill! You're falling for a myth!"
