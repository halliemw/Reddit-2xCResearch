He wanted the break as a way to (I believe) release pressure from commitment- he's away and it is hard for him to have his own time never mind time for me. I know that the point is that he is not making time for me. However, I do care about him.

He literally bailed on me 2 weeks ago on his only off day, and because we couldn't catch each other, he suggested a break because if not, we were (probably) going to break up. **Now I regret not breaking up** - particularly because I feel like he's flirting with other people in the mean time (from afar, of course).

Now to preface this - he totally pursued me and thinks that I am amazing (or he bullshits that I am amazing). I really did feel a connection and although at times, he's distant at work, we click in person and even on the phone/skype. **I love putting myself out there for him and finding that he feels the same about me. But when I don't find him there for me, it gets much harder.**
>

Last but not least, I just saw a super flirtatious comment from a girl on one of his social media accounts. I know I'll sound like a crazy paranoid ex when I say this, but when he bailed on me, he was stuck in the city she is located at. They like each other's face shots on social media frequently in the last couple of weeks. And I don't even know if I *want to* know if something happened.

I don't know what to say to him when we talk.. I need advice, or even better if you can tell me if you were in a similar situation and tell me how it ended up. Sometimes the biggest risks are worth taking, but only when you trust the other person, right?

**TL;DR - Guy I recently started dating asked for a break after (in my calculated predictions) he bailed on me to perhaps see another girl who flirts with him on social media.** **Don't know what to feel about it or what to do about it.**
