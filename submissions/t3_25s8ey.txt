I'm sure everyone has seen this before, but it still makes me laugh. Especially lately, as I've been spending more time than I care to admit in doctor's offices and emergency rooms due to unspecified pain. I'm hoping my neurologist will be able to put a name to it, but in the mean time, I'm terrified I have MS.

Thought I'd share the thing that made my son and I laugh while waiting to be seen tonight. [If Pain Charts Were Accurate](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/02/boyfriend-doesnt-have-ebola-probably.html)

Thank you all for always being around & so supportive. :)
