I've been invited to my friend's bridal shower. She is 26, I'm only 21 and haven't known her for very long so we aren't *too* close. This will be my first bridal shower I've ever been to for any of my friends so any help is appreciated! Her wedding is solely close family, so the bridal shower is sort of the 'gifting time' of the wedding. Even though she has a registry, I have no idea what to get her. What is appropriate?
