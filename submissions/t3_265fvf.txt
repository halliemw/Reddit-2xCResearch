Im asking more about non-fiction. I'm reading Women Who Run with Wolves by Clarissa Pinkola-Estes right now and I love it. I love books with similar themes about self-empowerment, especially when it relates to a woman's perspective. 

So what books have you read that really changed your life/perspective and think everyone should read?
