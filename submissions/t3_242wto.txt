Tonight, my boyfriend and I were on our first date in a long time. I was wearing a cute short skirt and some asshole driving by yelled "Nice skirt!" at me - obviously he could have been a lot more vulgar but I think we all know what he meant. My boyfriend was very upset and angry at the guy and he kept apologizing for that happening and asking me if I was okay.

I think he was more upset about it than I was because I've been dealing with this for years just like any woman and I'm sort of... well, I'm not numb to it, but I try to be - otherwise my entire day would be ruined every time it happened. But my significant other was really bothered by it and I could tell he was upset about it for the rest of our date.

Which lead me to want to ask, how do you cope with street harassment? How do you not let it get you down, or not feel ashamed when it happens, or not have it ruin your whole day/night? I know that this is a problem I'll always have to deal with as a woman and I just wonder how on earth I can manage to cope when it happens and not just want to break down and cry.
