I'm only 16 years old, and it's such an embarrassing problem to have. Hanging out with friends, someone tells a joke, and wham I wish I was sitting on a toilet. I've gotten really good at hiding it because I've been having these pants wetting episodes for almost 3 years.

It's been 3 years and it's not my fault I'm wetting my pants. I can stop hating myself. I'm getting a follow up because there was protein in my pee, they're checking out my tests.

It's such a relief to know what's wrong with me, but I still feel shitty. What kind of 16 year old has incontinence? Isn't that for old people? It's a lonely world.
