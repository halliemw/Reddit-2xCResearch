Essentially, I've been browsing this sub-reddit and I read something about the girlfriend zone. Where a girl and a guy are friends and continue to generally be good friends, until the guy ends up asking the girl out, the girl says no and then the friendship breaks apart. I guess I just wanted to say that if two people spend a lot of time together and even if they didn't view each other as prospective boyfriend/girlfriend material then they can end up getting attached to one another. Now the level of attachment will likely never be the same and there is a large possibility that it could be very one sided. The post that I read said that this was regularly happening to one woman and that she was giving up the idea of having any close male friends. How do you go about asserting the boundaries of friendship without inviting anything further? Do any of you have experiences like this?
