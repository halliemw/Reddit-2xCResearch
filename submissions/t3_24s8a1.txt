Every month for the past few years now my uterus has tried to kill me.  Really I think it wants to leave.   Before my period I can count on vomiting (sometimes for one day sometimes more,) full body aches, migraines and the occasional fever.  If family history counts for anything I'm looking at about another 20 years of this.  I know its not "normal" I just don't know if its abnormal enough to bring it up to a doctor or if they'd just blow me off....again.  Or even if there is anything that can be done.  I've been on bc and off bc neither way helps.
