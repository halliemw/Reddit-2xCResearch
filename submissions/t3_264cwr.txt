My boyfriend of 7 months talks frequently about sleeping with other girls. When I press him about it, he says that he does not ever sleep with other girls and we spend lots of time together, and I do not suspect that he does. Still, he talks about my friends, my co-workers, and other girls that he knows and says that he would like to sleep with them and sometimes tells me that he does, only to tell me later that he is just joking. It hurts me to hear this because I think he is being honest that he would like to sleep with other girls and I would like to be the only one he wants to spend time with.
The other thing that really bothers me is that he often will tell me to be quiet when he is getting his work done, saying "women are not allowed to talk while men are thinking." I know that this is just his sense of humor, but after reading this subreddit I am beginning to think that I should take issue with this. He also says other things like "women are not allowed to talk while men are talking/sleeping/reading/etc." Again, he smiles while he says this and tells me he is joking.
2X, can I have some advice here? 

Edit for people who may not see my comment in the responses, I posted this:
Thank you all for the responses! I just took the time to read them all and they truly meant a lot to me each. It is good to know that 2X and reddit have so many kind and thoughtful people. After the first hour of responses I took the time to think and then I decided that he was being negligent of my humanity and my feelings and decided it was time to end it. Off to his house!
