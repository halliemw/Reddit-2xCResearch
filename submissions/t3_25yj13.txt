Hi everyone. I have a Mirena, about 1.5 years in. I absolutely love it and it's not going anywhere until it has to, but it has occurred to me more than once that that's a procedure that's going to have to happen some day, and I don't know much about the experience of it. All I knew going into it was that it was effective and it wasn't going to kill me or do long-term damage, and that's all I needed to know. The insertion hurt like a mother fucker, for several days, and I would like to know whether or not to expect something similar, better, or worse. Does it hurt as bad coming out as it did going in? 

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback, everyone! I appreciate everyone telling me your stories. It's good to know that getting it out (prooooobably) won't hurt as much going in. Upvotes for everyone, hurrah!
