I wouldn't say the bride and I particularly close, but I'm really offended I was invited to the bridal shower, and not to the wedding. It didn't occur to me until after I got home from the shower that the wedding was pretty close, and I still haven't received a formal invitation. I found out that other friends had received a formal invite, and I'm a little annoyed. 

I understand that budgets change and not everyone can be included, my goodness this feels really rude. I can't believe anyone would be so rude to invite someone for a gift and not include them in all the festivities.

Has this happened to you? What did you do about it? I'm considering saying something to the bride.
