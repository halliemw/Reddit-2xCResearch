So this guy has been messaging me. I'm not interested since he is married, but he just told me his name to find him on Facebook so I could see more pics and see he's a "normal dude". I could so easily send his wife (they have a young child) a message to let her know what he is up to. Part of me really wants to (having recently been cheated on, or rather, found out I was the 'other' girl in a relationship that lasted nearly two years...another story), but also it's none of my business and I'd feel horrible breaking that young naive mothers heart.  I'm mad. This dude is a douche.
