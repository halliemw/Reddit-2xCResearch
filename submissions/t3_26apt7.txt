Hey 2x,  
I hope it's okay to make this post. I feel uncomfortable and really need another female's support in this.  
My period is 5 days late. I'm a 21 year old university student, currently not sexually active, and I have been getting my period regularly about every 30 days ever since I quit BC pills last November. I keep track of my period with an app and it uses my average cycle to project a start date, which in this case should have been May 18.  
I might be a little overweight and I work out regularly (I have a Strong (wo)Man Student Competition coming up!). I'm under stress all the time, because of my studies, but this hasn't influenced my period in the past.  
I only once skipped a period entirely, which was when I was 13 and me  and my family moved transatlantic and I had a rough time adjusting. I have been getting my period regularly ever since it started at age 12.  
Should I worry about this?
