I have had the worst 2 weeks.  
I travelled 9 hours to visit my FWB for a week, where I got my period on the second day. Neither of us like period sex, so there was no sex until the very last night.  
One of the nights I was there I had intense diarrhoea but I was too scared to go poop because it's a tiny unit and there were like 4 people there. I had to wait until morning.  
We had anal sex but he thrusted a bit too hard and my bhole hurt for like 3 days. The whole time we were doing it I was terrified of shitting myself because I've had fucky intestines for a few weeks.  
While I was travelling back home my ear got blocked up, and the day after I woke up with the worst flu I've had in years.  
The day after that, I was running with my dog chasing me and I crashed into a doorframe and broke & dislocated my toe.  
The antibiotics I got for the middle ear infection I ended up having gave me thrush. My FWB was home for easter and, again, we couldn't have sex because my nether regions were on fire from thrush. I tried to give him a BJ but couldn't breathe through my nose because of the flu.  
I think I scratched my clit off, it itched *so bad*.
I was having some weird pink discharge along with the thrush and nothing I read about it mentioned pink discharge. The only thing that said anything about pink discharge was implantation bleeding. Oh shit oh shit oh shit.  
I have Implanon and my FWB also pulls out so there was practically no way I could be pregnant but I was still shitting myself (figuratively, thank god).
The test arrived in the mail today and I'm not pregnant! And the thrush is clearing up! The pink was probably a bit of blood from the scratching. Finally something good.

I'm so exhausted guys. Everything shit that could happen has happened. I want to cry and hit the reset button. I need to know someone else is having a bad time.
