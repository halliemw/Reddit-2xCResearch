Title says it all, really. I know male geeks tended to have a huge affinity toward Ender from Enders Game when I was a kid (I think I just dated myself), but I can't really think of a female equivilant. So help me out! 

What heroine did you identify with the most as a kid? Preferably the main character of the book/movie/tv show.
Why?

For me, I guess Alanna from the Song of the Lioness series by Tarmora Pierce. I liked that she was into a male-dominated activity (knighthood) and didn't let that stop her. I liked that she was intelligent, compassionate, tough, and had a temper. I liked that she was willing to work extra hard in order to not just survive, but excel. I also liked that she struggled with and ultimately accepted her femininity. As a geek raised by a very anti-pink mother, I actively denied my girly affinities for a long time, and the fact that Alanna learned to enjoy wearing dresses really helped me. 

Okay, your turn!
