I'm not sure who else to talk to, I don't have very many female friends I'm comfortable talking to about this, so I'm hoping you lovely ladies can help me out. 

I went to the gyno yesterday, it was my second time needing my "lady bits" examined. I saw the same doctor that I saw last year, so I didn't feel too nervous. Last year she was really sweet and understood me being nervous. She did the exam really slow and told me everything she was going to do before she did it. Sounds great, right? Not this time. The exam started normal, questions, breast exam, yadda yadda yadda. When it came time for the pelvic exam/pap, she put the clamps in without warning. To me, it felt like she was shoving them in without any lube or anything! I was already tense, and it made me tense up even more and grab the handles of the exam table and back up. I told her what she was doing hurt, and she actually said to me "I'm almost done." When it was over I found out the was so forceful she made me bleed, and I was in excruciating pain all day. 

I feel like she was very rude and unprofessional, and I don't know what I can do about it. I already know I'll be switching doctors for next time, but is there anything I can do to make sure no other girls experience this? I'm at a loss, I've never felt so violated in my life.
