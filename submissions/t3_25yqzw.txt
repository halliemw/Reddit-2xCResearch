Hello all you lovely ladies out there! I guess I'll just start at the top: I'm fat. Always have been and I have accepted that this body is my body and I'm working to take care of it. But somewhere along the way I have also accepted the "Because I'm fat no one will date me" stereotype. 

Can I be friendly with someone I find attractive? Sure! But actually asking them out or even thinking they may be interested in me? Impossible. And trying to online date is a nightmare, seeing the "horror stories" people post about ending up on dates with fat people have just made me just too scared to even admit when I'm attracted to someone. I don't want to be someone's "horror story". 

So to my fellow larger ladies out there how is your love life? If you shared my fear how did you overcome it? Do you have a significant other who loves you no matter your size? Just have some friendly dating advice for a lonely gal?
