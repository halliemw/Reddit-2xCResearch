Sorry for TMI, but I've come to find out I have a shallow vagina. A bruised/bleeding cervix during sex is pretty much normal for me no matter how careful I try to be and I've mostly just gotten used to it. I recently got a rabbit vibe for personal sexy times and it seems like it would be amazing except it's too long! I can't insert it far enough for the rabbit to hit my clit without the other end of it bashing my cervix. It's awful! I'm willing to buy another one to try again, but I'm looking for suggestions. Surely I can't be the only woman with this problem. Help!
