Thank you again to everyone who gave me such great advice and support on my first post: [Mean Girls Lady Boss...Help!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/22zx8k/mean_girls_lady_bosshelp/). 

I found a new job (a much better job, YAY!) and gave my two week notice yesterday. As soon as she got word of my impending departure I got the following email from the director (ie lady boss), "Hi. I heard the news about your new opportunity and would love to chat for a few minutes. Will you have time to stop by at 4:30? Let me know. Sorry for the email – tried to stop over or IM but couldn’t catch you (smiley face)."

I responded by saying that I wasn't available to meet with her but that I would set some time up in the near future. I then created a meeting invite for her and the only HR person we have on staff for next Tuesday (two days before my final day here). I made it clear in the email that I would only meet with her if HR is present. They both accepted the invitation.

So, I'm going to get my day in court, so to speak. Face to face with my work bully. I've got 1 week to plan what I'm going to say. Any advice you wonderful Xers can give me is much appreciated. 

Fight the power!
