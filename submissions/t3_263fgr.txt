Excuse the wall of text...

So a few years ago I was in an abusive relationship emotionally and physically-mostly sexually. He was my first and we were together for a while. I've been dating my current boyfriend for 3 years. We want to get married and buy a house and i'm really excited for our relationship to move forward. I'm extremely motivated and think of myself as a capable woman. About a year ago I realized I needed help with issues from my previous relationship. So, I went to therapy and things were going okay until I hit a bit of a snag. In theory I love sex.  It's a fun and amazing expression of love between two people. Unfortunately because of my experiences with my previous relationship I have like zero sex drive. This has been an issue with my partner, even though my guy has been VERY supportive. Sometimes I will give in and have sex with him when i'm not really in the mood (which is rare honestly) but when I do, I just sort of shut down. My experiences in the past have told me that my main worth as a female lies in my willingness to put out. I know its very unhealthy but my ex did a fantastic job of slowing teaching me that. Currently things seem to be going really well and then I just hit an emotionless wall of terribleness. Anyone have any advice on how to make sex feel like less of a chore? Or any other ladies who have gone through abuse have any ideas on how to cope or explain it to my partner in a way he might understand? To be honest i'm feeling a little lost right now. I know sex is supposed to be fun, but for some reason my brain and body refuse to cooperate.
