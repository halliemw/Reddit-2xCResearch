I have always hated blow jobs. Ever since I was eight and made to do them. The very thought, for a very long time, made me gag. I had a boyfriend, and I couldn't do it when he asked. I choked and gagged before it was even in my mouth. I had a few flings and one nighters. Still couldn't do it. Another boyfriend? Still no. Then when I was a month shy of seventeen I got a more serious boyfriend. The only one where I tried hard to do it. But I was *always* reluctant. I *never* enjoyed it. And he had to ask or pester for it, and would try and take control and generally not respect me. He didn't respect me as a person either. And I was never truly attracted to him. We were together for years.

 I'm a few months shy of 21 now, and I slept with someone casually. Someone who I was extremely attracted to and vise versa. This guy seemed to respect me as an equal, and wasn't selfish in bed either. He didn't even have to ask. I found myself readily wanting to do it, so I did. And I *enjoyed* it. Guys, I *enjoyed giving someone a BJ*. For the first time ever. I never thought this could happen and it did, and I'm so happy.

All it took was time, maturity, real physical attraction and mutual respect. I know for others it may take more than that, and for others it may never happen. And I respect that.

I just had to share, I'm not really comfortable talking about it to anyone else but reddit, and especially TwoX, and this is a pretty major thing for me. It's something that has bothered me because I always wanted to work past it.

Edit: This isn't turning up in the "new" tab but it already has five upvotes. Guys did I break reddit I'm confused.

Edit2: Did my post get removed? It disappeared again! Or could it be that I don't often use this account and reddit is just being weird?
