An acquaintance of mine moved to the far north of the country, so we became pen pals! Just got my first letter from him, and I have to say, getting letters (rather than bills in the mail) is the best. We never really kept in touch very well, and writing letters is almost as much fun as receiving them, and way more intimate than online chats. He put in song lyrics so I put the songs on while reading... very cool.

I figured I'd share this idea with 2X because I'm getting a kick out of it. Signed up for a calligraphy class, too! Anyone else here pen palling?
