My daughter is eight. I wasn't planning to go into detail for a year or two. However, I have read of a couple of cases where a girl got her first period at nine. I would hate for my daughter to experience that without any knowledge that it was coming that soon.

I want to add, she knows about the subject because I have been a bit open with her when I get my period. She knows it will happen when she's 'older'.

When did you tell your daughter(s)? 

Edit: Thank you for all your comments!

Edit 2: I am sorry that there are so many mothers that left many of us unprepared. I wonder what their experiences were as they grew up.
