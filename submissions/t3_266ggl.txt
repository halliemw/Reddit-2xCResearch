*First, reddit has totally crapped out on me, and it didn't seem to be allowing me to post, vote, comment, or anything else. I am sincerely sorry if it is a problem on my end, and you are seeing this post multiple times. But it's like hearing silence on your end of the phone here. yikes.*

My vagina is..smelly. 

With that said..I'll be making this attempt brief. I've tried for a good hour to submit this. Just know I'm at the end of my rope here. I'm desperate. Basically, my vagina has an pungent smell. It's affecting my sex life. It's not him, it's me. He's been very sensitive through this all. 

If I don't wear panty liners I need to change my underwear frequently during the day. What started out as BV, turned into three heart dropping Doctor's visits. I'm in an exclusive relationship with my husband, but I do take my health seriously. So when the icky smell remained after medications I returned to the Doctor. Had my Paragard IUD removed and starting taking OTC probiotics, got tested for all the STD's and even had a Pap already on the calender. The Doc says its just an over abundance and should clear itself up..but what was to be a few weeks at most is now two months.

 I can't deal. Tell me I'm not alone, tell me there is an **answer** to this because I just feel plain YUCKY. I feel so alone and oddly, unwomanly. No other gals I know could offer any advice just sympathy.
