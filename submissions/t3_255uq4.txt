Over the last couple years I've gained a bit of weight. According to my BMI I am obese, and while that was hard to hear, I've started eating better and exercising in hopes of getting to a healthy weight, even though my diet really wasn't that bad to begin with. It confused me that I never felt like I looked that fat, but I assumed I was in denial about that.

Then I saw an IFF post about T-shirt sizing with weight and measurements listed. I saw my measurements were about the same as a model who is actually about 45 pounds lighter than I am. I'm (granted, pretty significantly) bigger in the bust but our waists were the same size and hips seemed that way as well, and we're the same height, and I highly doubt that my boobs weigh 45 pounds. The model who was about the same weight as me (also the same height) was 12 inches bigger in the waist than I am. I still want to lose weight just so I can be back to where I was when I felt my best, but I mean damn. Same measurements, 45 pound weight difference? That's just frustrating.
