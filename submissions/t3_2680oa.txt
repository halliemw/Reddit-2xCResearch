Okay so the thing here is as a teen I was chubby, had braces, glasses and was really nerdy. I looked like ugly Betty. Much like her I grew out of that and changed my looks completely. Now I sort of look like Fiona from shameless but "better" looking (so you guys get an idea of what I look like) . Anyway the guy I'm dating is that guy that's popular and god looking and all his friends are as well. Recently I've been getting hit on a lot especially by his really good looking friends. Now the issue here is that since I was so ugly at some point in my life I can't see my self as that good looking girl these guys are looking at. (don't get me wrong I'n not saying I'm a godess). I see myself as that pudgy looking brace face girl... I can't look at myself and say damn I'm hot. I don't know if this is how I really look (pudgy ugly and nerdy) or how these guys see me as an attractive, cool and funny girl. I see myself as average (on a good day) and maybe even completely below it regularly. I feel like a lot of the time these guys just hit on me because they see me that day in a fairly good light but regularly they'd see the real ugly version of me. I don't know if maybe I still haven't grown out the bad image I have of myself or if I'm that person I see.

TL;DR Was fat ugly and nerdy. Did a 180 (i get hit on a lot) but I still see myself as ugly and feel they do it maybe out of pity.

Question here is: what do I do to see myself as everyone see's me and how do I not let this new found beauty get to my head.
