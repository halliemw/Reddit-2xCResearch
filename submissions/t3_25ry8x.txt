I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. He's a wonderful person, he's a kind boyfriend, very attentive, just all-around awesome guy. Up until 5 months ago, I would be all over him like white on rice. Just recently though, it's like I don't get very aroused by him anymore. I don't know what it is, I was very satisfied with our sex life before, he is a very attentive lover, I always achieved an orgasm with him. I've always sort of lamented that he isn't a very dominant person in bed, but I never felt deprived. Any advice? 

Just want to clarify that I don't necessarily mean that he isn't doing the right things, I just mean that MY personal level of sex drive has gone down for some reason. I have communicated this to him and we both couldn't come up with any solutions, which is why I'm asking for advice. I haven't started any new meds and I don't take hormonal birth control for medical reasons and I don't FEEL like I'm under any more stress than normal. Basically, I'm just looking for advice as to how to jump-start my sex drive again, even if it's relaxation techniques, maybe pushing for more frequent sex, or trying something new. Maybe some of you have gone through something similar, tried something and it worked? I'd like to know what those methods were. Any and all advice is appreciated.
