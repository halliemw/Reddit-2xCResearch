I have an Implanon, which is a progesterone only birth control. It's like, amazingly convenient and super effective, so I'm loathe to get it removed but I seem to get side effects more than I did with my old combo pills. Side effects have been weight gain and a really hard time losing it, acne, spotting, and decreased libido. The side effects were really gradual so I was in denial for a long time because I didn't want to have it taken out, but I can't really ignore them any more.

Does anyone else ONLY get side effects with progesterone-only and not with combination BC?
