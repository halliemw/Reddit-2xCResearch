My boyfriend and I have been long distance for four years. FOUR YEARS! We've been through the ups and downs of this circumstance. He lived over 1000 miles away, and we've tackled the 'what ifs'. For LDR's, there's common thoughts like, "am I holding him back?", or "Is there someone else right for me out there?" We've gone through a break-up, stress of life apart, and A BABY. Yes, we had a baby while in the LDR. Skype only goes so far these days. You get to see them, talk to them, but there's nothing like first seeing them when they visit. Well, anyways.....four years later and he's FINALLY COMING HOME TO STAY. He's on his way right now making the trip home, staying here, and we're going to be all together! So happy Redditors! Just remember that these things CAN work! :)
