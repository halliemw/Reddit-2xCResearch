I live next door to CVS and run there at strange hours of the night for things. They also have a security guard there many nights since it's on a rowdy college campus, and I have a fairly friendly relationship with him. 


So the other night I stopped by and this woman came up to me in the parking lot, saying she had a weird question and to stop me if it was too personal. She wanted to know what the name of that "thing that goes up inside women to stop them from getting pregnant" was. I said, intrauterine device? and she said yeah, where do you get one? I told her I wasn't sure, but my friend had one and I'm pretty sure you needed a prescription. At that she looked really sad, and the security guard came up and stared at her and she walked away. 


Later the guard and I are talking and he says I should stay away from 'people like her,' because it looked like she hadn't showered in weeks and was trying to get her hands on an 'item' they carried, and was probably a thief. I was really uncomfortable with how he was talking about her, because she hadn't seemed dangerous at all, just sad and worried. I wish I'd pointed her in the direction of some resources for getting free or cheap birth control, but I'm not sure how to have that conversation, especially with a security guard hovering menacingly. I'm really worried that she was homeless and having to turn to sex work to survive, and won't have access to make that work safer. 


I feel bad that I couldn't help her out, and bad that I didn't challenge the guard for saying some problematic things, but that's in the past. Anyone have any similar encounters to this, and have any advice for possible future ones? I need to get more in touch with what sort of local resources are available for sure.
