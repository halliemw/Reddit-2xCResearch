This is supposed to be a positive and supportive place anyway, and I've seen downvote features removed in other subs. The number of new posts with more downvotes than upvotes is staggering. I've never seen hundreds of downvotes in this sub before and it's very disheartening - many very good posts are getting blasted, and the mediocre posts that I'm used to seeing a handful of upvotes on are just getting destroyed.

I don't want to become a private subreddit, that would be so purpose defeating. It's nice that the sub has been recognised but it's not going very well for us.

Does anyone think this will blow over in a few days? 

EDIT: Also, are there any changes to the sub that could be made while keeping twox as a default sub for exposure while keeping it safe from some of the negative impacts of being a default?
