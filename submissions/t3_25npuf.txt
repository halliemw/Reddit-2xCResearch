Help!

For my entire life, all of the hair on my body has grown in incredibly thick. My leg, pubic, and armpit hair in particular is really thick and wiry. I can deal with my legs (though my pores are ridiculous) and my pubic hair, but my armpit hair frustrates me. My armpit hair is just as thick as the hair that grows in my nether regions. I lack the confidence to wear tank tops without worrying that I'll accidentally show my underarms and I always keep my arms down when I'm wearing a bikini. 

I have tried waxing (the hair was too short and thick to wax and I ended up just hurting my underarm skin), tweezing hurts like crazy, and shaving just leaves a dark shadow on my arms where the roots can be seen under the skin. 

My armpits look very similar to [this before picture](http://www.westderm.com.au/sites/default/files/images/underarm%20hair%20removals.jpg) all the time, except darker. I cannot afford laser surgery and I need to find another way to lessen the amount and thickness of hair under my arms. I'm tired of hugging myself when I have sleeveless shirts on....
