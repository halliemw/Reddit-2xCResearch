Can someone tell me what this is: http://i.imgur.com/zRoCiME.jpg. It is the tiny reddish spot in the middle of my left labia. It's a little flap of tissue. It has since disappeared completely, but was there for about 2 months. I have had the full Gardasil vaccine series, and because of that I know a genital wart is unlikely, but not impossible. 

My dermatologist saw it twice in person and examined me with a dermatoscope and told me it was NOT a wart. Then I showed my gynecologist the same photo (all I could do was show him a photo, because the thing disappeared in about a week when I poked at it) and he said it was "probably" HPV. Wtf. It's gone now so I can't get a third opinion or even a biopsy taken. I'm in diagnostic limbo. It sucks.
