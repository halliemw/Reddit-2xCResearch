Sorry to derail the *amazing* period poop posts, but I think this is a conversation this sub should really have, especially now that we are a default!

Obviously, I want those Nigerian girls to be saved. But the people who took them are men and they are real. Just like the "real women have curves" campaign de-legitimizes girls who *aren't* curvy, it's a way to vilify these select assholes by dehumanizing (or actually, emasculating) them. The thing is, they are not exceptions. Human trafficking is so much more prevalent, and a lot of *real men* are doing it right now, outside of this specific issue.

It's great that the word is getting out, and, three weeks later, the US finally sent people over to help. But this isn't a singular issue, and this isn't an issue we can overcome if we treat it like an exception. *Real men* do buy girls, and it's a symptom of a much deeper problem. 

I don't think a solution will be found by dehumanizing these awful people because, well, they *are* human. It feels like they're writing off human capability to be that inhumane to others (which happens constantly in different forms all over the world). **We need to do a better job of teaching all men in all societies to humanize women, otherwise the problem will persist without abatement**. Making it a question about masculinity--a social construct--is not helping the problem.
