So hubby and I were talking about our pasts, and it came up that i had nude photos of me taken by my ex....He asked to see them, and I was afraid he would be upset/jealous but he LOVEd them and begged me to let him keep them. I catch him looking at them all the time now.
He has taken many nudes of me so i dont get why these are more exciting to him--anyone else ever have this happen?
