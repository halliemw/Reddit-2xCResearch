So, I currently work at a Burger King, and I was tasked with doing the mulch outside, which took like 15 hours all together. I was outside mulching on Friday, when a man in a truck marked with a landscaping company logo pulled up. He told me that I was clearly working really, really hard, and that I was the kind of person he'd want to hire. He handed me a business card and told me to give him a call if I was interested in working this summer. No mention of the fact that I am a college-aged girl; he treated me like I was any other person. Progress is nice.
