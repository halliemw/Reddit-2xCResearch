In a nutshell, my mom is privately shaming her boyfriend's daughter's best friend for wearing short shorts and being, in her words, a "hoochie."

I say privately even though my mom's boyfriends daughter and her friend know my mom doesn't like her, and my moms boyfriend already told me that the two girls said "watch shes not gonna come to my birthday party" which is today.

This girl is 15 years old, has an alcoholic family and me and my moms boyfriend feel empathy for this girl and realize she needs love and encouragement and not judgement and discouragement. 

My mom is 50 years old, may be feeling jealous, and I feel she is being very judgmental and I still remember what it feels like to be judged. 

I want to encourage my mom to be less concerned about judging others, and for her to understand that I am coming from a place of love and that I want the best for her and will be glad to help her through whatever is causing her to judge this poor 15 year old.
