This is a cross post from /r/SALEM (Oregon) but I thought it might be interesting to readers here. I am not a mother, but am an advocate of breast milk/feeding. 

I am curious:

* What your opinions are on the topic of breastfeeding, generally, and opinions of this sort of donation program?

* Would you donate if you could? 

* What are the drawback to donating or using donated milk?

* Are there any other programs like this around the world that you know about?
