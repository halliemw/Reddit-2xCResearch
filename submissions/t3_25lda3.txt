My husband tells me I am beautiful, but I can't help but think he is too biased to tell me differently.  I just don't know what to do about it.  It's mostly just my face where this centers around.  Things I dislike:

* My cheeks are fat.  The rest of my body isn't, but I have chubby little chipmunk cheeks

* I wear glasses.  I have worn the same pair since I started college (I'm 26 now).  They are children's glasses because all the adult glasses I tried on looked way too wide on me.  Maybe I need a different pair?

* I never wear any makeup or doing anything with my hair past putting it in a ponytail.

I am mostly just venting a bit, but also hoping for some advice.  It feels like I need someone who can look at me objectively and tell me what to change.  I don't know, but I'm tired of feeling this way.
