Okay. Let me just give some backstory: I am 21 years old, and lost my virginity when I was 19. I have had a total of 3 partners, one of which is my current SO who I have been sleeping with for over a year. We have sex pretty consistently (3-4 times a week, permitting). I have also been on Beyaz for going on two years now, and am up to date on my lady visits and have a clean bill of health down there. (Aside from a couple of yeast infections this year, thanks in part to antibiotics I had to take for illness). I am able to insert and remove tampons without issue. 

Anyway, EVERY time, without fail, initial insertion is extremely painful. It doesn't matter if there has been sufficient foreplay or not, it hurts and it takes a minute or two for it to be comfortable (I assumed when I first started having sex, it was because I was new to it, and that was why). My current SO and I have tried different positions for insertion, all have been painful. However, the pain goes away after those couple minutes. I spoke to my lady doctor about it, and she said it could be that maybe he is too large for me, I need to be comfortable, etc.

I am incredibly comfortable with my SO, he is the love of my life, and I never feel weird around him. I have done some Googling (I know, maybe not the best way to figure it out) and have seen a few sites that claim it could be a condition where my vaginal muscles just tend to tighten up like that, vaginismus, and it's involuntary. Whether or not this applies to me, I don't know. I've also noticed sometimes after sex, I cannot have sex for at least a day after that. My vagina gets inflamed, and any insertion during this time is EXTREMELY painful. 

Does anybody else have this issue? And if so, how do you deal with it?Anyone that I have brought it up to can't relate.
