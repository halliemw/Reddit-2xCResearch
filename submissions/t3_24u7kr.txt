Okay so I was at the gym today running on the treadmill when I felt like I was suddenly getting my period.  So I hurried and got off the treadmill and went to the bathroom, and when I sat on the toilet I discovered there was no blood in my underwear as I expected but I heard/felt something fall from my vagina into the toilet.  It was a small ball about the size of a dime, and it looked like a transparent-ish ball with a redish center.  I stared at it in the toilet for a good 5 minutes very shocked and confused.  I have never seen something like this and nothing like this has ever happened before to my knowledge.  This was not accompanied by any bleeding or anything else.  My last period started about Wednesday, April 23 and ended sunday the 27th.  Does anybody know what this was?  Thanks in advance!
