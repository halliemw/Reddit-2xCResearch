I have followed from a distance feminism and other egalitarian ideological stances. Me being what i am i held a slight skepticism towards them. I held the view that they were valid and basically correct views. Feminism was one were I have more than one objection but that's not for here to discuss for right now. 

My revelation was a more intimate encounter with what a woman can go through. I was getting groceries and i went to the check out that had a very shy nerdy looking girl at the register. first I thought she was kind of cute. nothing wrong so far. Then I had a sexual fantasy pop in my head. I would rather not say what it was but it was not a non-consensual fantasy. anyone have a theme of fantasy when you see a person of a certain type? That's what made me feel strange at first. Then i realized something. She looked trusting, weak and exposed for some dickhead to use and abuse. She might not have been, just that she could be what I described. 

I know I can't understand completely but I feel that I know just a little better about your point of view. I hope you don't have this happen to you for real. I hope this isn't too much of a downer. Because I feel pretty bad right now.

I just made this account to tell this thing so I guess this is some what of a throwaway.
