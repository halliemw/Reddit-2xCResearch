Long time lurker, first time poster. Just wanted to know if I was alone here. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for the better part of a decade following my father's death and my mother's cancer diagnosis while i was in high school. Ive been on and off medications(SSRIs) and counseling since then. I was doing alright for the past couple of years through the end of a 7 year relationship and other assorted issues but recently I've been struggling and have been considering going back on the meds. The problem is, all of my close friends, both male and female, seem completely against this for a variety of reasons. Is it just me? I feel like it's a valid treatment and hate the stigma attached to treating mental healrh disorders, but the lack of support makes me feel worse. Ugh, I guess I just needed to vent and maybe get an outside perspective. Thanks ladies.
