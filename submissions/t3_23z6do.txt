So I take a current events class that has about 15 boys and 4 girls and yesterday we watched Miss Representation and today we discussed it and when the topic of rape came up I brought up the fact that 1 in 6 women is a survivor of rape or attempted rape pretty much all of the guys laughed at that statistic and I immediately wanted to cry and became anxious. Why don't men understand that laughing off serious statistics like those is terrifying because that makes me feel like they would laugh it off if I was raped? I'm still anxious and I'm trying not to think about it but I now I'm just reassured that rape is a joke to most people and that I should never try to talk about it or it's high likelihood without receiving hostility and humiliation. How do you handle people who act like this?
