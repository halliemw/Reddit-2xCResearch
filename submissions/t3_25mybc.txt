I'm 15 years, fairly healthy, but I have horrific periods. For example, one period was so heavy, I had worn a extra heavy tampon AND a sanitary towel, but within an hour I had flooded through both. I have discussions with my mom who is very supportive, and she has mention birth control (I.e the pill) as a way to regulate periods. I'm still young so my periods are quite irregular, but they also last for up to a week, sometimes a day or two more. Would anybody be willing to share some pros and cons for using birth control?
