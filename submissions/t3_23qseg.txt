I started taking birth control a few months ago.  I was prescribed Loryna, which is a generic of Yaz. I did some research on it and found a lot of negative reviews about it. I even searched on this subreddit and found negative reviews. This made me hesitant to take it and worried about what effects it could have on me.

I have been taking it for 4 months now, and I have had no negative reaction to it. No weight gain, cramps, depression, etc. In fact, my face doesn't break out anymore. I haven't had a pimple for a whole month, which has never happened to me before.

All in all, I just want to post this so that if anyone is ever researching Yaz or Loryna they might come across this and not feel as nervous/scared about taking it after reading so many negative reviews. Not everyone is the same, and you could react to it negative, but it's not all bad.
