[Here is what we're dealing with.](http://i.imgur.com/HuJtAUp.jpg)

I've never had anyone (even my mom) sit me down and explain how it all works. So I just let them go. I have NO IDEA what I'm doing and when I have attempted to do it myself it always looks terrible. I'm afraid of getting them professionally done. Not because of the pain, mind you. Because I don't know what would look good on me, and because they grow so uneven.

I've never had a problem with the way I look, but I'm getting married soon and I do NOT want their current state captured in our photos forever.

I need some guidance.
