Hello again!  We're gearing up here in Appleton for Women and Identity in Gaming Symposium!  I posted about it earlier, but if you've forgotten or didn't see the first post, [here it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/23a0br/ive_been_planning_a_new_event_i_would_like/). 

For those of you who cannot make it, we will be live-streaming our 3 main speakers and the gaming panel.  Our own Jenny Haniver (/u/JHaniver) will be speaking first on Saturday, May 3 from 12-1 PM Central Time.  Then, Ashly Burch will be speaking from 1-2:30 PM Central Time and the Gaming Panel will be from 5-6 PM Central Time.  Our last speaker, Allison Salmon, will be speaking on Sunday, May 4 from 1-2 PM Central Time.  All of these live-streamed events can be found [here](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/women-and-identity-in-gaming-wigs) while the event is happening and will be put up on our YouTube channel about a week from now as videos. Someone will be watching the live-stream chat, so if anyone has comments or questions, type them up and let us know!  We will NOT be watching these Reddit posts- sorry, too many things to do day-of!  Please write to us in the live-stream chat!

Thank you all so much for being super supportive out of all the subreddits I've posted to!  You can go into my posts and see the responses I've had elsewhere... Not too nice in some cases.  I really appreciate the feedback and support I've gotten here.  Thanks again. Love you all! <3

Please check us out if you can't make it in person- we would love for there to be more than the 5 people who watched us last year!
