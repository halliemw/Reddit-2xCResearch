This is unusual for me, usually I wear a full face (I'm a trained makeup artist so no cakey-ness here) as I'm very self conscious about my deep set (see: sunken) eyes and my still healing acne.

Anyway, today was just one of those don't-give-a-fuck days, so I decided to just fill my brows and wear a little mascara, and I rocked up to work despite feeling completely feral. But the exciting part of the story is that my major work crush comes in, and the first thing he says is not 'are you okay? You look really sick' (which is the usual no makeup comment), but 'hey, you look good without makeup on.'


Such a little thing to say and it completely made my week, I went from feeling ugly and unkempt to beautiful. As well as this, I usually tend to romantically associate with men who make me feel so down about myself, and even if it is just someone that I have a thing for, to hear it from him was so refreshing and such a new experience. I'm still smiling like an idiot.
