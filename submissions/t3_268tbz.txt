I'm a college freshmen and I'm attracted to my tutor(who's older than me). He makes me laugh and I can't help smiling when I think about him. BUT, the tutoring sessions are over and I miss him. I can't help but wonder what could have happened if I had the guts to ask him out on a date. I'd appreciate some advice on how to move forward and get my feelings sorted out.
