I've been reading TwoX for a long time, and while I'm drunk I might as well talk about why I'm still up at 2:30am and crying on a couch. My ex decided to tell me, an hour ago while we were out, that he doesn't think I'm enough of "the one". And yeah, I get that if you don't feel it there's nothing you can do. But this is literally a few hours after he asked me to decide if I felt like we would be getting married one day. I said yes. I guess I just can't understand why someone would be so hurtful. Why ask me to explain how you're one of my top priorities when you're going to tell me I'm just not special enough?? Man, this sucks.


EDIT: Currently packing up my stuff to move out. Ex staggered in about 5am and has since been passed out. Just gotta get through these 4 hours until my folks get here and then I'm 100% done. Thanks for the support TwoX :)
