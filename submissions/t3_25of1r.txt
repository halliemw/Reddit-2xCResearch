Every single one of you needs to take a self-defence course. 

Every. Single. One. 

And if you are unable to do this for health reasons, that's another thing entirely, but have and learn to use some bear spray. 

Look, I know that we shouldn't *have* to do this. I know that the onus should be on people not to rape/assault/etc., rather than to avoid being assaulted. 

However, and this is a key thing you all need to realize... Just because the onus is on them doesn't mean that the consequences won't fall on your head. To not be prepared to defend your person as best you can is to showcase extreme ignorance about how the world *actually* works. 

Right now, the top post is from a lady who is being stalked. To her, to all of you, I say this: 

**TAKE BACK YOUR POWER!**

Learn to defend yourselves. In an ideal world, and if you're lucky, you will **never** have to use the knowledge. But if you *do*, you will want it to be physically innate. You will want it to fall back on. 

Doing this may not prevent all bad things from happening, but if it prevents it once, it's worth it. If it makes you feel less afraid, it's worth it. And if it doesn't do any of those things... At least it's a good workout. 

Sidenote: [Nonviolent Crisis Intervention](http://www.crisisprevention.com/Specialties/Nonviolent-Crisis-Intervention) training can also be invaluable to diffusing risky/dangerous situations as well. (There is an element of self-defence in there as well.) 

Please. Don't wait for it to be something you *need* to do to feel safe again.
