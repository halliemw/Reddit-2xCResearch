So uh. I made a post in this subreddit before about [a problem I have](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jtpyg/i_dont_know_what_a_vagina_looks_like_and_im/) (I've forgotten the password for that account, it's been two years). I kind of haven't managed to overcome that problem since that thread, and I know that makes me kind of shitty and pathetic but whatever. 

Anyway, the big problem now is I think I have thrush. I've got an appointment with my GP next week because I've got a pretty nasty infection around one of my nipples which is no fun and the antibiotics I was on didn't clear it up at all. Really they just made my life a little bit worse. Anyway, the thought of talking to my GP about my vagina is horrifically daunting for me, and the possibility of having to actually show my vagina is already giving me panic attacks, but even beyond that I'm fairly certain the solution will involve putting something into my vagina and I don't know if it's something I can do, but I don't think I can explain that to my doctor without sounding like I'm insane. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me. Or... I don't know, I'm not sure really what I'm hoping to get out of this. In all honesty I'm hoping it magically disappears before I see my GP and I never have to mention it again.

Edit: Or you could downvote me. That's helpful too I guess. If this should be in a different subreddit, can someone let me know instead of just silently downvoting? Or I dunno. Whatever. I guess it's a stupid problem. 

Update: I haven't seen my doctor yet, but I got an over-the-counter cream to use on the meantime, though I'm not really 100% certain where I'm putting it which probably isn't a good thing, but hey, better than nothing, right? I tried taking a picture to see if I could figure shit out, but I couldn't even see any openings and now I just feel sick on top of everything else.

Edit 2: Okay, I guess I'll go now, people are just kind of downvoting everything I say so I'm pretty sure I'm not welcome here. I just thought I might be able to get some advice. Someone linked me to [this article](http://www.theperiodblog.com/2013/03/how-to-find-your-vaginal-opening.html) and I'm trying but I still can't find an opening and every time someone said that in the comments the answer seems to be "Just stick your finger into it" and I don't see how I can do that if I can't find it.
