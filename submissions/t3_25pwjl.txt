Hey 2xers! We know that some of you have not been happy about the recent change to make 2x a sub. I was one of the people outspoken in my criticism of 2x going default, and I've actually mostly come around. I still disagree with how the lovely mods here do some things. But they're grown a pretty freakin' awesome sub to the point that it was big enough to default. And one of the things I want is for women to have a greater voice on reddit, and having a woman's sub among the defaults is a great first step. 

But for those of your complaining that 2x isn't a safe space, well, you're right. But why fight over how to run 2x when you have alternatives? We deserve more than one great woman oriented sub! So, I'm here to introduce /r/FemmeThoughts to you. The only thing default about us is that we default to awesome!  

The goal of /r/FemmeThoughts is fairly similar to 2x. We're a casual, comfortable space for women and friends to share perspectives and experiences in relative peace. Our rules are relatively simple: don't be a bigot, don't wish violence onto others, don't doxx and listen to the mods. And above all, have fun! All genders are welcome, but this is primary a space for women. Mods will give warnings for lesser offences (like mansplaining), but bigotry and trolling get banned quickly. 

Come and check us out!
