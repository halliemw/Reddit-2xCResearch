(Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my regular account).  This happened a few months ago, but it's been on my mind a lot lately and bothering me.  I was trying to wait until marriage to have sex, not for a religious reason, but because I wanted to save something special for marriage.  I was very adamant on waiting until marriage and told my ex on multiple occasions "Never ask me to have sex if I've been drinking.  I might say 'yes' but my real answer will always be 'no'".  I was okay doing some sexual things (oral was as far as I was willing to go), but I had made it very clear I did not want to go all the way on numerous occasions.

We liked to drink white wine, and one night we had way too much.  I think I had a whole bottle or more.  I was intoxicated and I even remember the room spinning.  We were making out in bed pretty intensely and as my sex drive had been low lately (I think it's because my psychiatrist prescribed me Prozac for depression) I guess my ex wanted to take advantage of this opportunity and pushed hard for sex, asking if I wanted to have it.  I was unable to say no.

About seven seconds later I felt this feeling of horror come over me as I realized what was happening and pushed away and rolled over to the side of the bed.  But it was too late; my virginity was gone.  My ex was clearly irritated and asked a few minutes later did I want to have sex again because the first time was really short, but I said no.

That was the only time we ever had sex.  I got dumped a couple weeks after that happened, probably because I freaked out and acted weird the whole next week.  But it's still on my mind a lot, and I feel like I should have been able to say "no".  I'm very conflicted right now.  I don't even know what my thoughts are on sex anymore and if it's worth trying to wait again until marriage, or just give in and have it whenever I want it.
