Hello, I'm a 25 year old woman who works 8 hours/day as trade marketing in a big company. I live alone in a city 3 hours apart from my hometown (where all my family is) and I'm currently dating a divorced man (with no kids).

I'm currently engaged in several activities outside work such as gym, keyboard and singing lessons, a study group about religion and I'm also currently seeing a shrink.

Still, none of these seem to get my mind off dumb thoughts like I'm undeserving of love, I'm not good enough, not interesting, pretty, funny or smart enough.

In my job, I feel like I spend so much time without anything to do, it's not challenging at all. I would quit, but this is the third job I feel like this and I have nowhere else to run to.

Sometimes the divorce thing seems to be the thing that's really getting me, because no matter what, I always feel like the other woman, like I'm wearing someone else's shoes, and that just makes me miserable.  I really don't want to break up with him, he's lovely and haven't done anything more than trying to make me happy, but still...

Do you think the main cause of my constant sadness is about this relationship issue I can't deal with or do you think it may be something else?
