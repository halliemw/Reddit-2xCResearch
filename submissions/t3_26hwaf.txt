Hey girls. So on Thursday I went to get a breast ultrasound on a lump I'd felt. A couple of things came up that I wanted to see if anyone else had experienced.

First of all, the ultrasound showed nothing unusual other than dense tissue. I know this is good news, but...it still just feels off. I mean I can feel this lump inside me, and the ultrasound tech even said that it felt like a "real" lump. Is my body trying to tell me something? Or (more likely) am I being a hypochondriac?

The other thing is that it's been three days since the ultrasound and my boob is still very sore in the area they were testing. Is it normal to feel sore after a breast ultrasound? After three days??

I get paranoid about boob stuff because I lost a very dear friend to breast cancer several years ago. So if anyone has experienced anything like this who can set my mind at ease, I'd appreciate it! I'm planning on going to a gynecologist to bring up these possibly very silly concerns, but it's going to be a while before I can see anyone and I need to talk about it in the meantime.
