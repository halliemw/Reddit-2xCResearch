My girlfriend is not a redditor so with her permission I am asking you for her. She is 18 and is on birth control.  She is sexually active. 

She has been to her regular doctor who prescribed her antibiotics, this did not clear it up.  She went to a gynecologist who gave her anti-fungals, this didn't clear it up.  While there they tested her for STD's and she came up negative for all of them.  Her urine was tested and there was blood, white blood cells, and some sort of bacteria.  After the antifungals didn't fix the problem, she asked for antibiotics again and the gynecologist said no.

After the first gynecologist failed to fix the problem, she tried another one today that said nothing is wrong with her and that she's fine.  She's hit a wall now and we have no idea what to do.

My girlfriend is having abdominal pain as well as vaginal pain.  It comes randomly, some days she feels it only once, sometimes she feels it several times a day for hours.  She describes it as a burning feeling, sometimes sharp and stabbing.  Peeing burns, and the pain comes during sex to the point sex is impossible.

Her urine is cloudy, and sometimes there is some blood.  Most days there is some blood in her underwear at the end of the day.  Once when we were having sex, I noticed she was in pain so we stopped and when she stood up blood literally fell out of her.

Do any of you have any idea what this could be?  We've hit a wall and don't know where to go next.

Thanks for reading.
