So there's this guy I've been messing around with. Met on an app, he's a really cool dude. We have great conversation and the sex is even better! A couple weeks ago I asked what he was up to and out of no where he texts me ending our fling claiming I'm "too college for him". Now there is a 9 year difference between us but it really doesn't feel like it when we're hanging out! 


Now I was definitely taken by surprise by this and I felt kinda bummed about it, but I didn't and still don't want any kind of relationship with this guy. We have a good time and I know he enjoys my company.


Well, the other day he texted me again out of the blue, commenting on one of my snapchat stories. We texted for a solid 2 hours and sex didn't come up until the last maybe 10 minutes of our conversation. I proceeded to ask him why he was talking to me again as he said he felt it was "time to move on", he responded with "I was with a 28 year old and she was really boring in bed, and in general we should have some fun." I wasn't thrown by this because I know exactly what we are to each other, booty calls for sure. I was actually kind of excited that I was so good that I stuck out in his mind!


I have yet to hang out with him since he started texting me again even though I'd really like to. But my friends have me questioning if it's in my best interest to see him again! He's a great fuck and we can actually talk to each other! Unlike some of my other FwB. Am I being too "easy" (I hate that term) returning to him so quickly? Or am I truly being "too college"? Getting with him again wouldn't mess me up, emotionally, I know that is for sure. I would just love some opinions from ladies outside of the situation! Sorry for the wall of text... <3
