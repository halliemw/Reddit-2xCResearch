I cannot believe it ladies. I come from a broken home with two alcoholic parents. Instead of following their bad example (mom is seven years sober now, though!) I decided to dedicate myself to education. I have put myself through school on scholarships and loans, and have worked a solid 25+ hour serving job on the weekends. Today I found out that I was nominated for my university's honor society and I'm so pumped. Thanks for reading this post and taking a moment to share in my joy. Dedication can take you amazing places.
