Im a 21 (f), iv always got on better with guys than girls - even through school - too much drama and bitchiness :/...  I'm the only girl in a group of guys (because of the reasons above). Nothing has happened with any of the guys and myself in a relationship way, but everytime any of the guys get a new girlfriend, the girlfriend never likes me and my and my friend lose contact for a while until they break up.. Why is there such a problem with my friendships with guys? Want to get other girls opinions :)
