I'm on the pill so I've been having sex without barrier protection, however I took a few of my pills last month a few hours late. I also ran two packs together if that makes a difference. My boobs have been feeling really sore lately but I've had no other symptoms. I've taken three pregnancy tests today, two of them have shown absolutely nothing, not even a tiny or faint line, the other one has THE faintest line ever, I'm not even sure it's really there but it's making me really paranoid. Please help, has anyone experienced anything like this?
