I really need some encouragement, since my senioritis is kicking in, but my workload is still pretty significant. I was going to do a whiney, "wahhh someone slap my face and tell me to go face life" post, but then I realized, we could all use some encouragement!

So, for those of you who are in my shoes, YOU CAN DO IT. You've got this! Work hard, stay focused, and try to enjoy those moments of sleep-deprived silliness you'll have with your study pals in the library.

And on a side note- does having a great GPA in undergrad make a difference with regards to post-grad scholarships/fellowships? Because I'm doing some cost-benefit analyses over here ;)
