This is a response to the post on sexual assault and it got me thinking of how we can stay safe. This may sound ridiculous simply because rape or sexual assault can happen in a blink of an eye. However, being a New Yorker I sometimes feel very unsafe coming home at night especially since I was sexually assaulted near my house a year ago (17 y/o).


Some girls have told me that they keep their keys in their hand when walking or that they keep pepper spray with them. Others have taken self-defense classes. One girl has even said she messes up her hair whenever she is on a late-night subway ride in order to look insane and turn away any potential predators.


How do you stay safe and alert?

EDIT: Thanks for all the tips!
