I had my super awesome noise-cancelling headphones on while working, and was singing and chair-dancing away, when I noticed my hubby's face  in the mirror above my desk.  Not sure how long he'd been standing behind me, but it was long enough for him to get a good show.  Got me wondering what cringeworthy things your SO has walked in on you doing?  I'm sure I have way more embarrassing stories but this is the most recent :-)
