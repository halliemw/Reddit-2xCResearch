I'm pretty young (19) and lately, I've been going through some changes. Three weeks ago, I weighed about 94lbs (healthy for my height.) I've started the pill and I drink more water than I previously used to. I essentially used to drink primarily soda and juices. Now, I drink mostly water with a little bit of Mio flavoring. I work out very minimally so I don't believe it has anything to do with being fit.

I now weigh 100lbs and look significantly thinner. I've gone from a size 3 jeans to a 1 or 0 depending on where I shop. I do plan on working out extremely soon due to fear of losing weight from starting the pill.

Any idea what is causing this? Other than the water, I haven't changed my diet at all.
