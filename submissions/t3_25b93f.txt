If I hadn't decided to have two abortions. I always feel like it is not fair for me to feel so sad on Mother's Day because both were my decision and ultimately the right decision for me at the time. I probably wouldn't be where I am now if I had kept either to full term but especially on Mother's Day I find myself imagining what my life would be like. 

EDIT:
Thank you guys for your answers. It means a lot to just hear (read) that how I'm feeling is normal even after all this time. TwoX is such a supportive community and even though people are split on this sub becoming a default, it's all the activity on here recently that made me feel safe enough to post. Thank you again.
