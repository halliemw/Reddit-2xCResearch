I have one girlfriend who will verbally tell me to calm down when I get excited about normal things in front of our guy friends. I usually get so flustered by her publicly embarrassing me by outing my "feminine tendencies to be emotional" as I see it, that I just shut down and don't want to say anything for the rest of the night. How do I tell her that it's really rude and hurts my feelings without sounding weak and also letting her know that it's pretty offensive to say that to anyone?
