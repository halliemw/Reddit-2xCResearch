Recently I've been having bleeding after sex. I went to my GP who referred me for an ultrasound and a colposcopy. 

Can anyone share their experiences with having a colposcopy and what the actual process . 

Will it be done in the doctors officer or as an outpatient at a hospital? 

I'm based in Australia so if anyone can let me know about the cost side I would be very appreciative!
