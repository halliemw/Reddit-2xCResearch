It's probably my hormones... this month I was 5 days late due to stress and I'm normally exactly the same cycle length. But anyway, I'm sat home on a Friday night with you ladies and I shouldn't be, in my head.

Today I had plans to meet a friend and my boyfriend of 2 years was meeting his friends. We did the "catch up with you afterwards" parting which I understood as "after we do the socializing we'll hang out but we haven't decided what we're doing yet". I get in touch when I'm finished with coffee to see if I should join him or wait and see him later, only to be told that he's now made plans to have a guys night. Of course since he's polite he asks if I'd like to join, but doesn't specify which friends. I decline, saying that it wouldn't be a guys night if I was there, to which he replies that he "might" check in with me after whatever. Ok, fine so our tentative plans are cancelled. 

It wouldn't be SO bad if we hadn't discussed moving in together earlier and (despite him initiating the talk) he said that he would move in if he didn't have anywhere else but right now he liked his flatmates. Ok, so I'm second choice. I would prefer it to be more that he WANTED to move in than was forced to by homelessness, but what the hell. 

I dunno if this is more of a rant. Most of the time it's great. We're supposed to be doing something tomorrow, so I get to see him but... I feel like I'm the fall back guy.
