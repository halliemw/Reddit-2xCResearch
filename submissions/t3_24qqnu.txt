Basically, long story short, I (22/f) have a very strict dad who basically doesn't let me out and only does when I have a good reason for it. My boyfriend (23/m) has been dealing with it, but lately after a 1 year long distance part for a masters program that is finally coming to an end, he is incredibly unhappy with how much time I can spend with him now that I'm finally back home. Hes grateful that I'm coming home, but is tired of dealing with my dad and feels like there's so much that the relationship lacks because we can't spend time together.

My first reaction was to say that my dad's my dad and I can't do anything to change him. But after a few talks with my friends, they suggest for me to try to approach my dad and try to argue for more independence. This is incredibly scary territory, as he has very tempermental and I can see this going very, very south if he takes it the wrong way.

Please help? I don't know what to say, what to do, or who's "right" or "wrong". Thanks in advance
