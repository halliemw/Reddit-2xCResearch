My SO and I had a sort-of pregnancy scare last month. I was on antibiotics for a bad acne breakout so in addition to the pill we used a condom- which broke. I'm not pregnant, thank goodness. But it prompted me to look some stuff up, and I read that an egg lasts 1-2 days and sperm can live up to 6 days. 

So if you can only get pregnant 6 days a month, how are almost half of pregnancies unplanned? When I read that, I was shocked. I know friends and family members who've had unplanned pregnancies. How is it so common?
