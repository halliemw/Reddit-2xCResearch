I am stuck in retail limbo until I finish school. I am 24 years old and have been with this current company for 2 1/2 years. Its trendy, cool, higher and store and I love the merchandise. My old Boss, we'll call her Pam, loved me. I don't know why, but most people hated Pam. I had friends quit because of her. Still, Pam tried twice to get me into management positions but her boss (our out of touch regional manager) kept putting her own people into the two I was aiming for. Pam got me a promotion, each time, but not as good as what I was after. This last time the promotion sent me to a better store. Promotion still, but again, not management. Then she left the company. My new position is ok. But I am finding at this new store they don't push me to be better ot try to improve my job there or want to promote me like she did. Its a bigger store and I went from being the golden child to the underdog. I suddenly don't see myself getting promoted here for a long time. Pam just called me up. Asking to chat about an assistant manager position available in her current store. Its a plus size lady store. So I would have little knowledge of the merchandise nor would I be able to wear any of it. But assistant manager! I am meeting with her tomorrow. Its not nearly as big or well known as my current company. Or appealing to me as a shopper. But money! And experience!! And it would look good on a resume!!
