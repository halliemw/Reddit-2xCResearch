Alright, so I spent five years managing a fast food joint, then worked at home for a year so I haven't had a need for nice clothes for a while. I have one pair of acceptable pants and one acceptable shirt (both of which I wore to the interview). Here is kicker: I am really short, like 4 feet 10 inches short and I got fat. Real fat. It has been a rough year. Anyway I am trying to find cheap pants that accommodate my mass and are short at the same time. I am a size 14/16 in pants. I don't even know what kind of shirts I need. So far, eBay seems like the best option, but I was wondering if you guys had any other suggestions. Other websites? Any places running sales? I am going to the thrift store tomorrow and browsing eBay, but that's all I've got.
