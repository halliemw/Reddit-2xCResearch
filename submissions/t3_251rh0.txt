For some reason I looked at my college's "Confession" page, and I saw this: http://imgur.com/VeJxJY6

And I'm just tickled pink.  It's still a small school where scandalous gossip travels like lightning.  Freshman girls are informed that the campus is a fishbowl; anything scandalous they do will be observed.

And yet it's still a wonderful community with amazing students.  You might expect doxxing, or dribbled comments of "omg whoo?!!?" but instead you have general approval of the fact that the woman in question should be left anonymous.

What small things have pleased and surprised you lately?
