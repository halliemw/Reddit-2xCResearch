About a week ago, we had a big birthday blow out for a girlfriend of mine. I (F26), have been away for a really long time, and it's the first time my friend (F29) and I have had to reconnect. A lot of people I have never met attended and the party ramped up pretty quick. It was, by all standards, a really good time. Eventually my friend passes out in her bedroom around 1. I check on her every little bit to make sure she's okay.

One of these check ins, I come onto a male close friend of mine, helping two posing girls take selfies with her passed out on the bed. I got pretty upset. I berated all of them. I asked if that was how they'd want to be treated if they were passed out, and if that's the kind of respect they show for a friend. The girls got snarky and left, and the next morning I apologized to my friend if I was being rude to her pals. She said it's okay and acted nonchalant, but I haven't heard from her since.

I'm worried I've damaged the relationship, but at the same time, I stand by what I did. It makes me worried that we as fellow women are so willing to treat other women so crassly to, what, get a funny Instagram selfie? My male friend who was helping them has since semi-complained that I was a buzz kill and I pretty much told him to buzz off. All I know is that I personally would be upset if friends did that to me. It just seems like such a violation.
