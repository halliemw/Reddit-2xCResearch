Let me just preface this by saying that I am an Indian woman (by descent, I was born and raised in the states).  

There's been a big hullabaloo in the media fairly recently about India and rape.  Inevitably, these stories get posted on reddit, and certain recurring tropes get entrenched in the collective consciousness.  I'm just gonna list the stuff I take issue with.  

**1)** First off, there's the claim that India is somehow "rape central".  Statistically, this is false (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#Rape_statistics_by_country).  

A common counter-argument to this is the idea that there might be a lot of women not reporting rape incidents, or that a lot of rapes might occur in underpoliced areas.  This may well be true, and definitely deserves more investigation, but the argument used is very specious.  You're essentially saying "India has a lot of rape" because "it might have a lot of rape".  In addition, it discounts the complex issues of underreporting in other countries, and only focuses on India, as if this problem is unique to the country.  

"Then why do we hear about so much rape from India?"  Well, maybe it's because the country has fucking 1.2 billion people in it?  I mean, that's more than the entire population of the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan combined.  

**2)** Then there are the accounts of staring.  Staring is rude, yes.  Men like to look at women, and in the west, we expect them to do this discreetly.  Personally, I have never noticed a problem with staring when I've been to India.  My guess is that some portion of these reports might be due to the novelty of seeing a non-Indian?  

There's also the possibility that maybe, and I really hope this isn't true, but maybe, some women feel, on a subconscious level, more threatened by men of color, and are therefore a lot more likely to interpret things like normal looks as "stares" or "leers"?  I don't mean to discount the concerns of women, but the concerns of people of color are just as valid.  

**3)** Double standards - basically going off of the last idea; nobody really makes a huge deal out of groping in Japanese trains (but they should).  A German accent is seen as sexy, an Indian one is seen as creepy, etc.  Things like this further lend themselves to a more "subjective" interpretation of things, which scrutinizes certain ethnic groups under a more discriminating lens.  

**4)** Shaming Indian men.  I've personally encountered this once:  I was having dinner at an Indian restaurant with a (white) girlfriend of mine, chit-chatting about classes and such, when she declared what a shame it was that she couldn't eat Indian food more often.  When I told her she could easily find ingredients at local Indian-oriented groceries, she replied, under her breath, "Yeah...but it just feels so creepy there.  No offense."  

When I questioned further, she was unable to explain why ("The guys are just creepy!").  I'm sorry, but this just seemed like blatant racism to me.  

**5)** It takes a local phenomenon and turns it into a nation-wide one.  Nearly every rape case I've heard about has come out of Delhi, maybe a couple from Mumbai.  These are two cities in India.  America isn't full of crime simply due to Detroit and St. Louis, and India isn't full of rape for the same reasons.  

Of course, nobody sees it fit to generalize all of America as being reflective of its two worst-offending cities.  But, somehow, we end up generalizing India that way.  Kind of akin to how "Africa" is perceived as a country.  

**6)** It "excuses" western societies.  One of the most oft-repeated tropes in the "India rape" threads is how great the U.S. is in comparison, at upholding womens' safety.  Often, these comments will "exempt" the U.S. from criticism.  "Feminists should focus on the *real* misogyny", "Say what you want about us, but at least we're not *India*", etc.  Yes, white western men are perfect and don't ever rape, or sexually harass people.  Feminists should quit feminism and rally against INDIA, because after all, that's where all the rape is, except not.  Ugh.  

I'm anticipating a lot of hate for this, but let me just reiterate that I am NOT excusing rape, and I am NOT excusing the objectification of women.  I recognize that India is still corrupt, and has to make a lot of progress, but the situation is not even close to what most redditors make it out to be.  I'm merely pointing out the unfairness, and possibly very racist double standards that are sometimes used in discussing them.  

Thanks for reading.
