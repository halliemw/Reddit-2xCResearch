I've known since I was twelve that I never wanted children. My family is conservative, so I was never really able to tell my mom that I wanted to  be on birth control. Over the years, being on BC became this great thing that I would have *someday*, and be a real adult (ha!), and finally be able to have sex (after a couple pregnancy scares in my teenage years, I decided to be abstinent until I was on the pill). 

I also had no clue how to go about getting birth control, but it turned out to not even be an issue- last year I started getting acne, and it steadily got worse until I finally went to the clinic to get it looked at last month. The awesome doctor put me on tretinoin, and so I was actually *required* to be on birth control. I didn't even have to ask for it. I picked up my first pill box that afternoon. So easy! Awesome! I was told to wait until the first sunday after my next cycle, and so for the first time I was actually looking forward to getting my period. I took the first pill today, and I have a year's worth of prescriptions... it was (almost) worth dealing with acne just for this.   
I just had to tell someone. :) It feels so good to cross this off my list.
