Hey I'm new here! I've seen a lot of different discussions on menstrual cups both one time use and reusable and I'd like to give them a go but I'm still not sure I totally understand them. How far in do they go? Should the stem be completely in as well or just peeking out?  Is there more than one way to put them in? Has anyone ever experienced any problems removing them? How do you remove them? Should I still wear panty liners with them? Lol I have loads of questions so it would be great to hear you ladies opinions and experiences :) I'll edit if I think of more questions lol :)
