I have been dealing with PCOS since I hit puberty. I know I am not anywhere near attractive. I am overweight and my face is ravaged by acne and failed hair removal attempts. I thought I got lucky and found a good man who saw past that. He knows I have a poor self-image and that I think he could find a better looking wife. He knows I hate my face and that not being able to get pregnant breaks my heart. So the other day he makes some "joke" about how I'm "not a real woman". And I've been stuck in this state of emotional inertia ever since. "oops, sorry, just kidding" isn't going to fix this, and I feel like I am going to have to file him away with all the rest of the cruel men I've come across in this life. So now what?
