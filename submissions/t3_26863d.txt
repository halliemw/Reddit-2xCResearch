I could really use some advice and/or support. Simply put: I fucking hate my fiance's family. I could go into a lot of detail as to WHY, but I guess it doesn't matter a lot. 

Because he moved back to his parents' house, I have seen enough of them in the last two years to last me a lifetime. Being around them puts me in a sour mood, and I dread going to his house because of it. Even their posts on Facebook put me in a bad mood. I suppose I should do my best to ignore it and not let it get to me, but it's hard. I WANT to like them, and more importantly, I don't want to feel left out. 

Luckily, he just graduated, and as soon as he can find a job and save a little money, we will be moving in together. Until then, how do I deal?! Has anyone else been in this situation?

Edit: I want to add that I end up getting frustrated with my fiance because I just can't see how he can like these people. And then I remember it's his family, and I'm being an asshole. I hope someone can identify with me!
