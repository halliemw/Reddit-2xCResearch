I'm thinking of getting a treatment done on my face for my spider veins. They're not very prominent, but I would like to get rid of them while they're still light, (I'm not happy that I have them while being on the brink of 20). I booked an appointment for this week. When I went in for the booking, the lady said my treatment wouldn't take very long. She also said it wouldn't scar, but I thought I'd ask anyway. 

1. Will one treatment cause scarring? 
2. How can I expect the healing process to go? How long will it take?
3. How successful has this treatment been for you?

In the tanning world, my skin type is a 3 (if that means anything). It's not really all that sensitive, but it is kind of fair. 

Thank you for your help, ladies!
