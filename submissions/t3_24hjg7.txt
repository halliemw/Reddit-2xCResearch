I need some help. I've been fortunate in my life to not have to deal with acne on my face or anywhere else....until now. I am fairly certain it's due to working out 5 times a week, as it appeared when I started working out consistently. 

I have no acne anywhere else, but I have quite a few spots on my butt. 

I never wear work out clothes more than once between washing, and almost always change and shower immediately when I get home from the gym. The times that I don't are usually only a few minutes-drinking a shake or scarfing down some quick food, and rarely, taking 30-60 minutes to do some yardwork and stuff since I'm already sweaty and nasty. 

Any tips to get rid of them and avoid them in the future?
