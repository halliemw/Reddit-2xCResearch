Not sure if this really belongs here, but I couldn't think of any other sub and I thought you ladies might have some good resources or ideas. 

It requires a bit of backstory, so please bear with me. She grew up in a very rural area and was "homeschooled" - in actuality, there was very little schooling going on and she mostly got to do whatever she wanted all day long. When she was maybe 20 her family moved to the West Coast - still a suburban/rural area, but better. She tried to move out and live in a bigger city, but due to her lack of a GED/diploma, job experience, and a disability (hearing-related) she wasn't able to find a job and had to move back home. She's now 26 and quite understandably upset about her life. 

She never learned to drive, she's one of many kids and grew up taking care of her siblings. Her mom doesn't have a valid driver's license, her dad whom she doesn't get along with works long hours (and there's an interesting dynamic between her parents that I don't ask about - her mom has a boyfriend in another state who comes to visit). She's depressed and can't even get help for that because she has no insurance. 

Every idea I've thought of seems to amount to nothing. The nearest bus stop is 3+ miles away, she obviously can't drive, doesn't have the money for insurance/gas anyway. Nothing nearby that she could volunteer at. She thinks about getting her GED sometimes but with no transportation or way to get to a job, doesn't see the point. I don't know how to help her; I was afforded many more opportunities growing up so it's hard to even see from her perspective sometimes. The only thing I thought of was WWOOF, but that still wouldn't provide much except a way to get out of the house. 

TL;DR: My 26 year old friend never learned to drive, got her GED, or has had a job due to the circumstances she's grown up in. She's depressed, doesn't have much money, and wants to find a way to get a job/move out but doesn't know where or how to start.
