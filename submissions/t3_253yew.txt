So as my title says, I graduated from the program of my dreams last weekend (I went to school for baking), and it was also my first time seeing my boyfriend in 4 years. 4 years ago we definitely weren't dating, and actually lost contact for a while. Just a few months ago he messaged me and though he lives 6 hours away we hit it off again right away. This picture from my grad awards dinner makes me so happy... just seeing how he's looking at me lets me know that he's the right guy!
