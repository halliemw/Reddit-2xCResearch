Hey TwoX,

I chose this sub because none of the dating related ones seemed appropriate, and I am a woman and TwoX seems friendly! I'm trying to see this mass deletion as a positive thing because I've been single for 3 years and not even come close to meeting someone I'd like a relationship with. Also just to clarify I haven't been on all of them at once, many were hidden  and not used for months. 

I went on a few dates but none of the men jumped out at me with their specialness. I don't think online dating helped me at all, it was hard work for too little return IMO, I spent more time at home glued to a screen than out doing fun stuff. Feel free to tell me your stories about dating (online or otherwise) if you feel it would be cathartic!

I guess if I could put one question to you it would be what activities do you do to meet more people? I really would just like some new friends now,  gender irrelevant, and to keep myself busy rather than dwell on my singledom.
