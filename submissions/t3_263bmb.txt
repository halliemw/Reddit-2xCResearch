I live in southern Maryland and my particular area is very conservative. I understand the right to express your views, but where is the line drawn? The crosses are invasive, because people can't help but see them as they drive down the main road. In fact, I have to see them every single day I drive to my college (small community college). I have made the decision to get an abortion this coming Saturday and am confident that I'm doing the best thing for all parties involved, but that doesn't mean it doesn't deeply affect or hurt me. I genuinely don't know how I will handle passing them every damn day without serious sadness or rage. Is there anything I can do if it's private property? These have been here since at least 2004 that I know of, I am not too confident in my ability to have them removed or relocated to a less invasive spot. Any ideas? Help? Suggestions? Even if it's just for me emotionally, it would help right now.
