I've never been pregnant, but I do plan to one day. I'm a courteous transit rider and whenever I see a pregnant woman, I offer my seat to her. But there are some people that don't. Are they not looking up? Are they looking down so they don't have to risk seeing a belly right at eye level? 

I'm more surprised that women do this too, because I feel like there is an understand women have towards each other in these situations. 

I'm not trying to call these men and women out, but to understand why some people choose not to offer their seats. I would genuinely appreciate hearing why.

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback. This actually gave me a lot of perspective. I live in a city where they actively promote the idea that people should offer up seats to pregnant people, so I was under the assumption this was a universal expectation. Thank you!
