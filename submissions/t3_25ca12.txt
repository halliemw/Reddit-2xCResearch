I've been having libido issues for a while now and it's starting to affect my 2 year relationship. I love this guy so much and I want to meet his needs but I just don't have the libido to keep up, and I want to keep up. I'm on a birth control pill called Junel and I started this a couple a months ago, I was on another pill before (can't remember the name of it). If I remember correctly my libido started to dwindle when I first began birth control pills, I never had an issue with my sex drive before them so I'm fairly positive their the problem here. Is there a birth control pill that will help increase my sex drive but also keep my face from breaking out, my pms symptoms light, and my period short and light as well?
