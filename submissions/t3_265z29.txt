Going to a rock festival soon with a female companion which has a camping aspect to it. Probably 75% men end up going to these things. Tons of drugs and drunk dudes with two tent sleeps could create issues. Anyone been to one of these before? Is it safe for a lady to be alone when it gets dark? Or should i be escorting her once it gets later? Who has festival experience to share?

Security was awful at this festival last year so I am a bit concerned for her and myself since I am not a huge guy if something happened.
