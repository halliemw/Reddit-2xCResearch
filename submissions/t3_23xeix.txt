Sorry I know that title is terrible but tbh I'm embarrassed as fuck about the whole thing so I'm guessing frankness is a good start.

I'm 18yo. Finally got a sort-of-boyfriend. Went back to his place, we were both horny and la la things happened.

But the issue is.. I don't get wet much. Guessing combination of nervousness, the fact that I normally don't get wet much (even with just myself when there's nobody else to get nervous about) and general worries etc. I'm also.. way too tight. This is dumb but seriously he can't fit in more than two fingers and me barely three.

I know the obvious answer to this is lube and that's the next plan - but I'm worried I'll still be too small for him. Probably doesn't help that I have a very small frame?

Does anyone have any experience with what to do? Because I really really want this to happen and it's just.. it's like that gif of the train smashing into the tunnel, y'know? 

Sorry for how awkwardly this is typed, I'm very awkward about this because it's such a dumb problem to have. sorry if this is the wrong sub too. You guys are just.. so helpful and supportive and I hope someone out there can help me.
