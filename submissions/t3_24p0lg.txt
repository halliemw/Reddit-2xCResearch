This sub seems very supportive so I'm asking for help. I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm 19 years old. I had unprotected sex with my now ex-boyfriend but he didn't cum inside me. Now my period is 3 days late and I'm desperate. I also bled a little a week ago. I'm really stressed out with school and exams, also an important family member is getting surgery and I'm very worried for her. I think my period could be delayed because of stress. I also took a pregnancy test yesterday and it was negative. But I'm still very worried because I don't want to have a baby right now. Can somebody who has had an abortion pm me so I can ask for advice? What should I do next?
