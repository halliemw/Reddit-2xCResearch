Because I had one when I was 19 (22 now) and I would rather have sex with someone I am dating or in a relationship with, but the whole feelings thing just never works for me. I was recently dumped by the guy I had been seeing and I want rebound sex with a classmate of mine whom I've had sex with before but didn't have any feelings for. I fell really hard for the guy I was seeing but he just wasn't appreciating me. I'm a passionate lover and really into the whole lace, red and lingerie thing (I'm a fancy one haha) I'm on birth control and plan to also use a condom but I wonder if I'm being too casual about it given that a condom has failed on me before (however I was not on bc)
Am I being too casual? How should I go about this situation?
