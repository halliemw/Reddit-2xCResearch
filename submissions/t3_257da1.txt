Alright twox....about to go on a date with a much younger guy. I am 26 and he is 21. When we met I figured he was my age. He is very mature and very sweet. Very down to earth. Occasionally it is obvious just how young he is in something he does or says....
So, younger men? Yay, nay? I am of two minds, and need some advice, especially if you've gone down this road yourself.
(Also feel free to rant about the double standard of girls dating younger men vs. guys dating younger girls....)
