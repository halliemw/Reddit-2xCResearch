So long time lurker and I just really need some advice...

I have been working the same job for the last three years and my hours have more or less been the same. Last weekend after my shift I checked the schedule just for the heck of it, and I have no hours for the next three weeks. I never asked for time off or anything! Now my boss is out of the country for the next month and I didn't know what to do. I clearly can't afford to not work for three weeks. So I called her boss, who was going to handle all of her duties until her return. He said I could have all my hours back, end of story, thought I was all set. Until I started getting angry text messages from my boss's niece (who my hours had been given to) I have talked the situation over with a couple of my female coworkers who have all said what I did was uncalled for and a b!tch move versus my male coworkers who have said they would have done the same thing I did. I really don't know if I did the right thing or not now...and I don't want to deal with the fallout of drama at work?

Any opinions? Should I have handled it differently?
