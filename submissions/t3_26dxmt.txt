Hello everyone! Hope you're having a  lovely Saturday. 

I'm posting because for the first time in like 7 years I'm considering dropping the birth control pill. I was having a conversation with my bf,  telling him about the dryness that it caused my eyes and how expensive it is(I graduated, so no more school insurance). He then said that he didn't mind wearing condoms from now on. Since we found the right brand /size for him,  we've been using them every time I forget a pill or I'm on my period. 

I guess I'm just nervous about stopping after so long. I was hoping to hear how women felt about using only condoms as their main method of contraception with their SOs. What are the pros and cons? 

Thanks for reading!
