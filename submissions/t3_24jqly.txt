Hi their, ladies!

Most here have probably already read a ton of "DAE" or "Is this normal?" posts, but I just wanted to make a little colltection of habits/characteristics/bodily features that ladies in this subreddit have, that seem to them to be a bit (or a huge bit) off the norm. Maybe it helps some here to feel less awkward about their quirks without having to ask about it. Maybe it makes you find your soul sister, because you both share a characteristic that alters your life. I don't know what may come from it, but I'm excited to read about all those things that make the world a bit more diverse!
