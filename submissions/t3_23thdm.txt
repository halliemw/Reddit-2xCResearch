I got a call from my mother on Tuesday night, telling me my grandmother (dads mother) had passed away. This was not a huge surprise as she had been ill for some time, but my grandfather (mothers dad) had only passed away 3 weeks ago, so I was very upset that I've lost two important people in less than a month. I decided to still go in to work on Wednesday as I wanted to save my two bereavement days to be able to travel for the funeral. 

When I got home, my partner said he had not gone in to work that day, as he needed to go run some errands (picking up a new kayak he had just bought - nothing important). When I asked why they let him have the day off, he said he told them that I was so upset about my grandmother passing away so quickly after my grandfather, he needed to have the day off to take care of me.

I was pretty speechless he would treat a tragic family event in such a way. Would you be upset?
