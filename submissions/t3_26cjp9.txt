I recently bought a new dress that I'm in love with, but I am actually scared to wear it because it's mainly white with some black flowers on it and I'm horrible with light colored clothing!  Like I need to take a shower now and start to get ready to go out, but I almost don't want to put it on until right before I leave!  Any tips on how to wear white clothing without getting it dirty?  And if it does get dirty, what are the best ways to clean it?
Thanks!
