Hello, 

Well I'm taking a math class for the second time and got an A+ and a A-  on the first exams. However, I got a big fat F on the last one. I've had a terribly rough semester. I experienced the death of a loved one for the first time, my family problems escalated to such a height that I began feeling more and more sad. And I've been losing the desire to do well in school over the last few semesters. Honestly, it got so bad where I could not even push myself to study for the past month. Somehow I was able to go to work though, albeit very bitterly. Finals are approaching. My friend told me that I should notify my professor because I show signs of depression and post-death effects. But I don't know, do you think my professor will grant me leniency on this one test? She does not drop a grade unfortunately. 

EDIT: I'm also doing poorly in two of my other classes but I think I will still be able to pass. Honestly, I never would saw myself doing so poorly in college. 

UPDATE: Thank you all for your lovely help! I really appreciate it especially with everything I'm going through. I spoke to my professor and all she told me was she can't really do anything and to try to get a 90 on my final (She even told me to calculate myself what grade I need in order to figure out what to do Thank god I did that beforehand). Something I already knew so I can't really do much at this point. She even said that she knows I'll have trouble getting that grade. So she wasn't helpful at all. But at least I got up and asked her, the attempt counts. I'm going to speak to a counselor tomorrow so maybe she can help me learn how to concentrate better for finals week.
