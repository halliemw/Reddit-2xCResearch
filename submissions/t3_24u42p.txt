I'm a 19 year old college student with no health insurance. Never been to a gynecologist, ob/gyn, etc. 

I think I have a yeast infection and would like to get it checked. I never had a sex talk with my parents. Sex is a very uncomfortable topic around my family, sadly. I fear my mom will think my yeast infection will be sex related (she freaked out when she found out I was sexually active).

As a typical college student, I'm broke. I can't afford a $100+ visit. How much should I expect it a health check to be at Planned Parenthood?
