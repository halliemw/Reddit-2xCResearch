As I was reading a textbook for one of my summer courses  (a course that I should probably point out isn't outright related to gender studies)  - there is a very obvious use of female gender pronouns by the author.  For example: "The taxi driver has consented to work at this job, and if **she** has stopped to pick you up, that implies that **she** has consented to take you to your destination in **her** taxi in return for payment."

I know the use of female pronouns as a gender-neutral pronouns isn't a new phenomenon, but in nearly every example I've read in this text, the author uses it, and now I'm curious to hear anyone's thoughts on it. Do you think it's important? Worthwhile? Ineffective?
