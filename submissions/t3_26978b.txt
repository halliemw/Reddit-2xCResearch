I was walking home from work, essentially from the train really. It's late, around 1.30am. I was wearing a short ish dress, a summer dress really with a leather jacket, sandals and a scarf. There's no one around. I usually walk through a parking garage beneath apartments (it is on the ground though, so not underground) - and I'm just in my thoughts, tired and ready to get home and relax. All of a sudden I hear "Hello" and I am literally shocked, wondering if this person is talking to me...


So I turn around and it's this guy who seems to be a bit tipsy. I'm about 2/3 through the garage, he's at the entrance, I'm walking away from him. When I hear him, I stop and turn around and don't say anything. He then goes "kom hitt" which roughly translates into 'come here'. I go "Nei." (no) in a pretty aggressive and pissed off tone. He goes "kom hitt" again and I said "NEI" and start walking away. He then says something else like a little rant to himself, I'm not sure. I just keep walking away quickly and rip out my phone and desperately start calling my sleeping boyfriend. Walked the rest of the way back (about five minutes) with the bf on the phone.


I'm living in Norway and everyone says it is so safe here, but it's experiencing more and more crime. I don't care if it is 'safe' there is no way that a drunk guy in the early morning telling a girl to 'come here' in a parking garage - there is no way that is ok. And fuck him for saying 'come here' like I'm some fucking dog. Fuck him. He just stood there and expected me to come to him. Fucking loser. 


And so while I'm thinking these things, yes, it dawns on me. He did this in the early morning, with no one around, dark outside - in a parking garage. There is no way he had any good intentions. Because I'm wearing a dress he can treat me like that? Because I'm a girl? It is so fucked up. While I'm angry, I am also pretty freaked out at the same time.
