I now live with my wonderful boyfriend. I have a great job with a vertical career path. But in my 20's I was an escort to pay the bills. I miss the thrill, I miss the crazy hot sex. I miss making my own schedule. I miss the money. I miss the girls I made friends with. I loved it, I was so good at it, I enjoyed it and it made me feel powerful. Now I'm "normal" and bored with my life. When I was a sex worker I felt like I had more of a purpose.
