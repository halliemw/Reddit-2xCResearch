Hi 2X. I had never heard of this subreddit before it became a default and now I'm so glad I did because I need some advice.

The title pretty much says it all. I feel like a huge asshole, but for some reason I can't stop being selfish and jealous and envying what other people have. Friend gets a really great promotion? My first thought isn't about how great that is for her and how hard she works (much harder than me), but it's "why don't I get work promotions?" Boyfriend is traveling for work and having a great time with his co-workers, going out after? I get irritated and my first thought is all about how I don't want him having fun unless it's with me. My cousin graduated from a great university and has an awesome job lined up? I immediately think "Yeah well she's not all that great anyway she kinda sucks so whatever." College friend getting engaged? Why not me.

Afterwards I always kind of hate myself and berate myself for making it all about me when it is clearly not all about me. Sometimes I'll hear the way I say things and INSTANTLY want to take it back because you can hear the annoyance and irritation in my voice. It's like I feel a need to compete with people I love for things I don't even want that badly, and it ends up with me taking happiness away from the moment because of my own selfishness.

You don't have to tell me that these are toxic behaviors; I know that and I hate it. I have always thought (and still think) that a huge factor of love is the ability to take joy in your loved one's joy, but I just can't seem to get there. I try to give the appropriate reactions when people tell me their good news, but I feel like my selfishness is holding me back from being as happy for them as I could be. This bothers me so much because I really DO love these people and want nothing for the best for them.

Have any of you dealt with this issue? How did you overcome it?
