I'm sure this has been posted before but I just want to hear some thoughts about this topic. My mom is a very successful and ambitious career woman but laments the fact that not only is she not as successful as her female peers who do not have families and work longer hours, but because of her traditional role in the family (cooks and cleans, very present in her kids development) she is often exhausted and burn out. Its bad for her physical and mental health. But I want the same thing....career and a family. So I want to hear your stories, tips, etc.

Thank you
