I'm 22 and have been on and off the contraceptive pill for a few years now. I'm currently taking Femme-Tab ED 30/150 (which is a generic brand version of Microgynon 30 ED). The active ingredients are Ethinyloestradiol (30 microgram) and Levonorgestrel (150 microgram) in case that helps anybody. My question is regarding an ongoing feeling of nausea. I know this is a common symptom of birth control but I wanted to see how common it really is, especially since it's quite a recent symptom (read: last month or so, maximum) and I have not changed or started back up on the pill in that time. I guess I am trying to assess whether to attribute this queasiness to the pill or not. I was initially prescribed this version of the pill a few years ago as my mother took the same one for years (without side effects) so we tried that first up. As I never showed any negative side effects, I've been happy to keep using that brand. Is it possible/common to develop random side effects after a long period of time? Does anyone have any suggestions of what else could be causing this? I'm sick of vomiting!
