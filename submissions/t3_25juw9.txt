I'm a 40-year-old divorced mom of two. I've dated quite a few guys, but haven't met anyone worth keeping around until him. We have had a few ups and downs, but we've made things work for the past couple of months. Now, though, he's quit his job, having health issues, and caring for his mom (who moved in with him because she's in early stages of dementia). I realize he's under a ton of stress, but I feel helpless. He says I am a bright spot in his day and that I help him just being there for him. So I feel awful when I sometimes feel like I need more. We don't get to spend much face-to-face time (once a week, sometimes twice for a few hours). And so many nights I crave someone to cuddle or hold me. Dating with kids is difficult. Dating someone who is a caregiver to a parent is even more difficult. I just don't know what to do. I really really care for him. I feel like an awful person for even wanting to ask him for more time, more cuddles, more kisses, more... sex. *sigh* Am I being a jerk?
