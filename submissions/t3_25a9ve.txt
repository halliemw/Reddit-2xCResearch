So, I am semi-seriously dating someone for the first time. I have zero experience and recently told him that. You can read the whole story [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/21r7sp/how_to_tell_someone_you_have_no_dating_experience/) He was pretty awesome about it. Last night, we hung out with two mutual friends at their house and I realized that he never tries to touch me or even invade my personal space. I make an effort to do those things to show I'm interested in him, even though I'm not sure what the hell I'm doing.

At the end of the night we walk outside and he says we had set a precedent to kiss at the end of dates (he was just joking). I was kind of taken off guard though because he seemed so uninterested earlier. I'm also unused to kissing people and find it very awkward. At our last date I used a bet with my sister as impetus to kiss him. As in I told him "hey come here and help me win a bet." He didn't respond to that so I figured he hadn't heard me. But of course he brought it up last night. And I felt kind of like an asshole. I'm not in lust with this boy (I'm not sure if it's because that's all out of my realm of experience or what), but I do like him.

My questions are: any suggestions for getting over this whole lack of PDA in general and how do I become more comfortable with kissing? Dating isn't fun for me when I feel like I'm not able to give the other person what they need, especially when I'm interested in the same thing.
