Background: I was on the TriNessa BC pill for 3 years starting when I was 15 and I never really had problems with it. It made my periods lighter and shorter (before they were heavy and last 7 days) and made my PMS symptoms go away. When I was 18 I switched to the patch because I wanted to try something new. My periods became almost non-existant but I turned into super bitch so at my last wellness visit I asked to switch back to TriNessa because I had a good experience with it before.


Now: I've been on the Trinessa for a few months, and it was great for the first few weeks, but then I started spotting while taking the active pills. I know that's totally normal and I shrugged it off, but it never stopped, it just got heavier. I've had my period for 6 weeks now and it just keeps getting worse. I usually go through 2-3 regular tampons a day on my period and I just went through one in 20 minutes.  I have cramps so bad that I'm throwing up and I'm having trouble falling asleep because I can't find a comfortable position to stay in. I've almost passed out at work 3 times now while sitting down as well; I just randomly get light headed and my vision starts to go "black". 


I have an appointment with my doctor this week, but has anybody else experienced this before? I never had problems with this pill before, but now it's making me feel so entirely shitty that even a heating pad and caffeine don't help. I feel like my uterus is trying to kill me.
