Hi, I made a throwaway just because this is kind of embarrassing for me to talk about. I usually try to not masturbate for this very reason, but whenever I do, I always feel really sick for the whole rest of the day.

I experience :

* shortness of breath

* dizzyness

* foggy/blurry tunnel vision

* syncope all day

* tingly fingers and toes

* feeling like my ears are full of wax

I do have mild to moderate asthma and panic disorder, but I have been masterbating since 6th grade and have always had these symptoms with it. I didn't have a problem with panic attacks until 9th grade, so I don't think its anxiety-related except for the fact that my anxiety does get worse  after due to the side-effects. I am carefully not to hold my breath and breathe regularly. It doesn't take me long to orgasm, so I know that I am not over-exerting myself... And I don't get any of these symptoms when I orgasm from sex. 

What is wrong with me? Has anyone else experienced this? I grew up in a healthy household so I don't think it's anything psychological. Should I talk to my doctor? I'm afraid they will just blame it on my anxiety disorder, but it doesn't feel like a usual panic attack to me.
