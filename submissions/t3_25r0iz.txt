And the worst part is, it really is largely my fault.  I'm a really good girlfriend in most ways, but my anxiety makes me really irrational and I just let it show one too many times I guess.

It really sucks, because I really am madly in love with him, and I'd still do anything for him.

Oh, and it sucks even worse because we're roommates. Separate rooms, thank God, but still roommates.

Right now, I feel like a massive fuck up. I know we weren't exactly compatible, but that doesn't stop me from wondering.. IF I had been a little more in control of my emotions, we could have been really good. IF we weren't roommates, we'd probably still be smooth sailing. But I was, and we were. 

Maybe this was going to happen one way or another no matter how much I held my anxiety at bay, I don't know, but I'm just really, really sad and I don't have anyone to really talk to that hasn't heard this shit from me before.
