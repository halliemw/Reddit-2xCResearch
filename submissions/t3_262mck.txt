I'm very introverted and it drains me to be social. I hardly interact with classmates at my university... ashamed to admit that I'm in my mid 20s and don't understand social interaction or thrive in social situations. 

My cousin (who I rarely talk to) has invited me to attend her wedding and dinner celebration. 

I'm not quite sure how to act or what to say or do. Who to talk to, what to talk to them about? There's going to be a lot of people I don't know there and don't usually talk to. 

I've mindlessly agreed to going, but now I'm panicking about the social aspect of it.

Any help you can give me Twox?!
