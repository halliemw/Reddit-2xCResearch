Yesterday my mother was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer. Her mother died from it and we are all very scared and confused. My mother is deeply depressed and so am I (I am her daughter and chances are, I will probably have breast cancer too). To make things worse her birthday is on the 25th of May (happy birthday right?). I am at a loss, I want to help her and make her feel better but there really is not much I can do. Is there anything I can do? I feel so helpless, I love her very much, we are going to have a formal appointment with the surgeon on Wednesday and set the dates for the removal of the tumor. I really need some advice.
