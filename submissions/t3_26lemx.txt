I'm 20 and I've tried putting a tampon in before (as recommended, on my heavy-flow days) but it just felt uncomfortable and wrong and I could never get it fully in. I'm also TERRIFIED that the string would break and I won't be able to get it out etc. 

I've looked for so many tutorials on YouTube but I'm still not doing it right. It's time I get used to it because I'm sick of not being able to go swimming when I have my period. Also, pads just suck in general. 

I'm on my 2nd day of period right now and I'm going to the store later. So, what should I get? Which are the easiest to put in?

For some reason I feel like I'm going to die (TSS).
