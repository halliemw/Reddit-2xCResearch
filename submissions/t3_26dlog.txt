A week ago, my SO grabbed his wallet out of my hand and said he didn't want me to look inside. He was laughing and saying it's nothing but I started to feel worried that he had something big he was hiding. Later on in the day, our married friends came over and while the guys were outside the wife of the couple and I, went into the wallet and discovered it was a business card for a woman to get an engagement ring. I was relieved but instantly knew I shouldn't have looked. I told her not to say anything - especially to her loud mouthed husband. Not 15 minutes after they left my SO received a text letting him know what had happened. It totally ruined the surprise and I am sure that anything my SO was planning is totally off now because of this. The husband and the wife both think it's silly that I am not talking to them anymore. Am I being a grudge master? The husband and I have been very good friends forever and the wife and I quickly became friends. Just in the last year my SO has become good friends with the husband so it's not as though he had some under lining loyalty .... plus it totally wasn't malicious. Am I being a grudge master by not speaking to them anymore?
