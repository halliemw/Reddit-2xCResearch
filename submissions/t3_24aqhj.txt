I know, the title sounds weird but I don't know how else to describe it.  I have a best friend who I met almost 2 years ago.  We instantly clicked and have a friendship like I've never had before.  People mistake us for a couple because it feels like we are a couple, at least on an emotional level, and are always together...always.  We are also both single because we spend all our time with each other.  I do not (repeat...DO NOT) let people get close to me emotionally, my walls are high and dense, but she has gotten through somehow and knows me extremely well.  We text everyday (avg 50 texts a day), we are the first person each other talks to in the morning and last at night.  Like I said, nothing physical has happened and I'm not sure it will but I have this feeling of wishing something would happen because every other aspect of our friendship is great.  I've never had a crush on a girl, never done anything physical with a girl, but I find myself wondering about things like that with her.  We have sleepovers often and they are one of my favorite things in the world and they are strictly platonic with me giving her an occasional foot rub.  I don't know whether to just be happy with this friendship we have, I'm pretty sure she's my soulmate (and I don't mean that cheesy...it's just that we clicked instantly and it seems like we've known each other much longer than 2 years) but she's definitely a lifelong friend....I'm just curious to know if it could go further.  Does anyone else out there have a friendship like this?  What became of it?
