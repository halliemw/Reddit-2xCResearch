Okay, I'm not very good at explaining things but I'll do my best.

In high school, I met my friend and ended up getting along really well with her family. 5 years later I can hang out and the mom is pretty comfortable with me.

So I have spent the month here, because my friend just had her baby and she wanted someone around to keep her company at home. 
While being here my friends mother was talking about wanting to end her Marrige because she is very unhappy in it. He is emotionally abusive, extremely controlling and,  mooches off of her with no job an does basically nothing around the house outside of telling everyone else what to do and the "right way" of doing it. 
The problem is, she is afraid to do it. In the past he had a drinking problem and ended up beating her up pretty bad. He quit drinking and they ended up getting back together. She is stil afraid of him and during some arguments he kind of threatened her, IMO. For example she brought it up in an argument and he said "that was mostly my fault and partly yours. I was mad and was drinking and you kept giving me mean looks like the one you are giving me now. You only bring this shit up when there are other people in the house, like you are trying to provoke me into hitting you. I only did that cause I had alcohol, I won't hit you. If I had alcohol it might be another story..." and so on.

She really doesn't want to involve police or anything like that. She is stuck trying to think of a peaceful reason to end things. Recently a pretty shocking thing in his past came up which is pushing her at the edge. Whenever she brings it up he immediately dismisses it. 

TL:DR Friends mom wants to end Marrige, though due to past abuse she is afraid.

I am at a loss for advice, do you wise ladies have any advice?

I applogize for poor grammar and spelling. I'm not very intelligent, if you can't tell :P
