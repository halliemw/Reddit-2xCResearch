Saw the [Men and Females](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25zk6q/men_and_females/) post and it got me thinking about this. I try to use 'OP' when I can or 'They' (singular) but neither is perfect and no one uses s/he (it also bugs me that that word can't be pronounced). Any suggestions? I'm starting to think the english language needs to invent a word for this.
