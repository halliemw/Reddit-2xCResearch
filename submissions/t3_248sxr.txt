I am mainly writing this to calm and distract myself. I have lived in Alabama my whole life. I am used to this. I am 21 years old. Never ever have I gotten scared really, eh it happens right?

I lived in Tuscaloosa when a tornado hit 3 years ago yesterday. I wasn't scared. The following January another one hit my home town, nearly leveling all of it. Then i got scared. Not including the countless other states that are devastated year after year. The loss of home and life, not only that, the road to repairrrr is so intense and heartbreaking. I think the tornado just barely passed over me, and is heading directly for my parents house. And the rest of my family. Again. Followed by the last bit of my family...we all live along the biggest interstate in the state. Where tornados love.

Im so sick of these things. I never ever get scared and this time I am terrifed. Im so cosmically insulted arghhhhhhhh. I love the South, but this is weak.
