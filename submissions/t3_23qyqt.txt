I was a 15 year old with no self confidence. He was a 17 year old guy who decided to use that against me. No matter how much I told him I didn't want to, he wouldn't listen. He kept pushing me and pushing me. He got so close, my anxiety took over and I froze. He took that as a yes, and that's when it all began. The next couple years were spent with him. I felt too worthless for anyone else. Too dirty. I'd always tell him I don't want to do that. He didn't care. Even when I cried, he ignored it. His forceful touch overpowering my feeble attempts to push him away. He moved away, and I ended it with him, knowing that I wouldn't have to face him and his anger problems. 
I pushed it all deep down. I did my best not to think of it. Now I am 18, and I can't stop thinking about it. Every little thing reminds me of him. I am bisexual, but I tell people I am a lesbian, because whenever I am with a guy I think of him. Now it's getting worse though. Even though he lives hours away, I know he wants to move back here one day, and I fear that I will see him again. Every day I scan my surroundings to make sure he's not anywhere near. I can't get close to anyone without remembering his vile touch. I had a boyfriend who I really cared for, but there's one noise he makes that is the same as one he makes, and I ended it with that guy and haven't spoken since. Whenever I am alone, I want to cry because what he did is all I can think about. I want to be alone though, because of how dirty I feel. 

Why the delayed reaction. How can I forget about him. How can I trust guys again. I just don't know what to do... 

Edit: And I'm sorry if I put this in the wrong place
