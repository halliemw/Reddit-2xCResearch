I've been seing this guy for the past couple of months. He is amazing. We get along really well, our interests are the same and the sex... oh god, the sex is the best I've had. Everytime he comes over we end up doing it four or five times. He's a screamer (and he makes the hottest noises) and I get quite loud too.  
A few days ago, after he had just left, a neighbor knocked on my door. She was visibly upset. She told me that she can't stand our noises anymore and that the whole building has been talking about it. I was in shock! I apologized and told her I had NO idea they could hear us and that I would be more considerate in the future. She left more calmed, but angry still.  
I have some anxiety issues and this conversation has been going on in my head for the past days. Everytime I think about my SO I remember everyone has heard us having sex. I'm avoiding my neighbors as much as I can, and I can't stop thinking they judge me everytime they see me. I get tense everytime I have to leave or enter my apartment, the awful conversation pops up in my head all the time, I'm anxious all the time. I just want to crawl in a hole and die.  
I know I fucked up and I have every intention to stop bothering my neighbors. But I can't function with this overwhelming shame. How can I stop this awful feelings of embarrassment? Anyone else has experienced something similar?
