I am not a purse person, for the most part I carry my cell, debit card, and car key in my pockets while out of the house.  I am looking at upgrading to a smartphone but I honestly don't know how I would even take it with me.  It seems like exactly none of them are small enough to fit in girl jean pockets and an entire wardrobe change to accommodate a phone seems a little silly. I feel like there must be a solution to this problem that I'm somehow missing as I know lots of ladies don't like carrying purses!  I could probably put it in a coat pocket during the cold seasons, but even then I tend to leave my coat in the car if I'm going to be indoors for any length of time.

 Suggestions please wise women of twoxc?
