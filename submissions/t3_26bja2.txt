Okay, so I'm new to reddit as a community, but I do love reading all the support on this subreddit. I'm an introvert, I like to stay home with a good book, or playing video games. I can do nights out as long as its not every night. Large crowds of strangers makes me very uncomfortable, but if its a smaller group of people with similar interests I can usually get more comfortable. We can add to all of this the fact that I am 3 years single and pretty chubby in appearance. So yay self esteem issues!

My question to you guys is, where do introverts meet people? I don't drink, I don't play sports, I'm not one for Facebook or Instagram. I only have one other friend who lives in the city with me. I'm finding life to be very lonely.
