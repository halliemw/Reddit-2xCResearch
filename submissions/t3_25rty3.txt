Hey /r/TwoXChromosomes. Wanted to start off by saying I discovered you guys about a week ago when you became a default sub (one of my friends was unhappy about it and was talking about it on Facebook, so I came to check it out), and I have to say you guys are pretty awesome.

Don't know if this is quite the right sub for it, but I thought I might give it a shot. I'm a 22 year old woman who, through the blessing and curse of genetics and my Georgia Peach sensibilities about soft drinks and butter, is quite busty for my size. I'm 5'3" and wear a 36 D in most bras (though I'm currently rocking a 38 DD in a particular variety of Natori bras, which I love to death even if my bank account rather dislikes them). 

It's summer and I haven't bought a new swimsuit since I was 19, when i bought some insane pushup thing from victoria's secret. It no longer fits, and i was hoping for something less...obscene with a little more  support. I've had a hard time with finding that in stores and thought I might pitch it to the ladies of 2XC to see what sage advice they had in store. Thanks!
