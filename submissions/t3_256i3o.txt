I really have no idea if I ever want to have a kid. Argh. I'm at that age (28), where I'm being constantly bombarded with Facebook photos and pregnancy announcements. I'm honestly mostly immune to cute kid-baby fever, but I realize I probably should at least be thinking about a decision. I have some years left, but I no longer have 10+ years to mull my options. This, combined with ennui about not being as far along in my career as I'd like (ah, being a perfectionist), I'm suddenly panicking about my complete lack of certainty one way or the other. 

I'm married and my husband is awesome, but equally unsure. When we got engaged, we both thought we wanted to have one kid, but over the years, we've become less sure. I feel like we could be fantastic parents and absolutely could support a child financially. BUT, I've never been baby-crazy or a big fan of kids (though not rabidly anti either). I'm pretty sure my mother assumes I will never have children. I'm super passionate about my career. I love being independent and having hobbies and being my own person. All these logical factors seem to scream: don't have kids! But the analysis doesn't entirely convince me one way or another because I'm the awesomest at overthinking things. There's definitely a part of me that still wants to be a mother.  

We have four awesome bunnies right now, and they've been wonderful for us. In addition to being adorable balls of ridiculousness, I feel like they've made my heart grow, if that makes sense. If I were to have a child, I think that would be why--grow my heart some more. I absolutely know I could unconditionally love and care for a tiny person. But, I don't know if I want to make the sacrifices that being a parent entails. 

So, how do I become sure, pro OR con? Will I ever be sure? Is being unsure reason enough to NOT have a child? Is anyone else as completely confused as I am?
