My SO and I just got our first place and purchased a washer and dryer from a close friend. The dryer is working great but the washer is not doing the final spin cycle. It does agitate during the wash and rinse but won't spin. Our friend used it right up until we got it from her so it should have been an easy move. Any ideas? The washer is fairly new and roper brand.
