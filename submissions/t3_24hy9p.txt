Hey Ladies I was wondering if you could help me think of some poster ideas to stop sexual harassment that I could put up at my community college campus.

Here's some background: I am the leader of the Feminist Alliance Club at my school and during today's meeting the females talked about how the sun is coming out and they are getting leered at/talked to/HARASSED due to their "revealing" summer clothes (keep in mind we are in Seattle...so it's usually very cold). I told them I would put together a poster that says things along the line of:

- People wearing summer clothes are still humans
- Staring and asking for people's time while they are wearing summer clothing is harassment
etc.

Also, keep in mind that they need to stay fairly calm and cannot get too riled up (you know how those crazy feminists do!) because they will be on campus and must get approved by the club coordinator.

I am really stuck! Any help would be appreciated. Think: what would YOU want on a poster about sexual harassment in summer clothes?

Thanks Ladies <3
