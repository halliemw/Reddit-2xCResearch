Here goes another weight loss post.

To make it short.
I'm 22 years old. In my senior year of uni currently working non stop on my thesis. I am also running 2 of my father's companies that are currently at the peak of their success. I work 9-5 and go to uni at night most of the days of the week. My weekends consist of working on homework and my thesis which is to be finished around october this year. So basically I have no time for anything other than my education and career. And in the free time I do have, I am just so exhausted that I don't want to even think about exercising. 

So due to this amount of stress and no time for exercise, I have been gaining weight. 
I refuse to take a break since I am so close to finishing and I honestly can't leave my job unattended. 


However, I really need to do some changes to get back to where i was. 

I am not a heavy eater. The problem is that I am so busy that sometimes I forget to eat lunch, and then have a big dinner. I know that it is extremely unhealthy and probably the main reason for my weight gain.

So does anyone have any advice on how to deal with my situation? 

Any advice is appreciated.
