Way too often on reddit I see crazy things posted in relation to hormonal birth control. When you are prescribed it not many doctors will actually walk through what it is, what it does to your body, what's icky but completely normal, and what are giant fucking danger signs that you need to be on the look out for. Below are some things I commonly see, please add your own. 
  



 *Women who are on the pill and also use condoms who go out and get plan b if the condom breaks.* 

> [Plan B is basically a mega dose of progestin, which will prevent ovulation and hence conception if taken immediately after sex.](http://www.webmd.com/women/guide/plan-b) Assuming you are following the golden rules of birth control then plan b is just a waste of money and will screw up your cycle.  




 

*Women who think that they need to take the placebo pills/have withdrawal bleeding*
>The reason the placebos are in your birth control pack is that the creator of the pill thought that it would make birth control more [palatable to the Catholic Church. Seriously.](http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2010/05/06/the-pill-and-the-invention-of-the-monthly-cycle/)  The simulation of a "natural" period isn't doing you any benefit. You may experience breakthrough bleeding if you stack pills, and any change can be unpredictable, but the option is there if you want to take it. 




**Golden rules of Birth Control**

*  Take your pill every day within as narrow a time frame as possible. If you miss one day, be safe and use other means of protection until you have 7 days of pills under your belt.   

* Don't take antibiotics, or other concoctions like St Johns Wort - Check whatever medicine you put in yourself for contraindications with hormonal birth control. When you do need antibiotics, tell your doctor what birth control you are on, and make sure it is safe. If in doubt, use backup protection.  
  
*  If you vomit after taking a pill, you need to take another, or again, take 7 days of pills while using backup protection. 

 

**What is birth control even doing?**

For oral birth control pills, it basically comes down to the [mini-pill \(Progestogen only pills, POPs\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen-only_pill) and the [combined oral contraceptive pills \(COCs\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill)

Progestogen only pills require you to take the pill within a very narrow time frame for optimal effectiveness. They do not contain estrogen, so can be great for people who experience whacked out side effects on COCs. They work by thickening your cervical mucus, so sperm is less likely to penetrate the fortress of your uterus. They also may inhibit ovulation and chill out the growth of cushy cells on the lining of your uterus for any egg to implant on. 

The classic pill, COCs, have a nice combined dose of estrogen and progestogen. It will stop you ovulating, as well as all the fun cervical mucus thickening progestogen brings to the table. The estrogen  may be able to help with other problems, like acne and crazy periods. Can noticeably effect your mood - please talk to your doctor about trying other pills if the one you are on makes you feel horrible. 

**DANGER ZONE**  

Pills have been studied extensively and they are very safe. However, very rarely birth control pills lead to serious problems. The following are the warning signals to watch out for while using the pill.

    Abdominal Pain (severe)
    Chest Pain (severe), cough, shortness of breath
    Headache (severe) with blurred vision, weakness, difficulty speaking
    Eye problems-vision loss or blurring
    Leg Pain (severe)

If you have one of these symptoms, it may or may not be related to the pill. It is important to check with your health care provider as soon as possible.

Blood clots are a rare but possible side effect of birth control. If you have a family history, you need to tell your doctor. If you're a smoker, you are safer on the POP than on the COC, but quitting smoking is the best remedy. Women have died from untreated blood clots, so make sure you check out any symptoms that might occur.
