When people try to show sexism by reversing the gender roles in movies and ads, why is it always "ridiculous" and "funny" to see a man trying to be sexy?

Am I the only one who finds it even more sexist that men aren't allowed to be thought of as sexy in mainstream culture? It's like only women are allowed to be objectified and it's sending the very message it's trying to rail against.

Some of those ads were hot. But some of them, the man just had to throw in a comedic gesture, to "prove" how ridiculous it all is. So that straight men don't have to feel TOO uncomfortable watching other men?
