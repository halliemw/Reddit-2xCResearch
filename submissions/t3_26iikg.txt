Hi TwoX!

I have a bit of a long and complicated story, but the tl;dr version is that I've lost a whole bunch of weight which has enhanced the asymmetry between my breasts - there's now at least 2 cup sizes difference :(  My boyfriend promised me that when I met my goal size (size 6) that he would get me an augmentation/lift to even the girl back out.  Well, I've hit a size 6 and have maintained it for 2 months now, so it's time to start researching surgeons!

But there's a catch.  We're currently in Canada, but will be moving to India in the next 4 - 6 months for work.  Considering there are a lot of world-class medical facilities in the Asia Pacific region and costs are a lot cheaper, I'm considering getting my surgery done over there (cost of travel is so cheap that even if we're based in India, a flight to Taiwan or Singapore or Vietnam or wherever is super cheap).

So this is kind of a long shot, but can anyone recommend a surgeon or clinic in the Asia Pacific that does fantastic breast augmentations?  Bonus points if the clinic has a doc that does excellent face lifts as well (that one's for the BF, not me :).

If you can't recommend a clinic, any other ideas where to look? Obviously a google search brings up a million clinics, but I can't find any sort of trusted source ranking/reviewing them.
