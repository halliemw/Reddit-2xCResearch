Haha, i've been reading soo many BC posts, and theyre filled with horror stories!! I'm planning on going on the pill for the very first time soon, my doc recommended Ortho tri-cyclen. But all these posts are kinda scaring me lol.i need some pill confidence!
I wanna know if Pros to BC exist ;-;, not just Cons

So tell me how hormonal BC has helped your life (cleared your skin, lighter periods etc. etc.) !
