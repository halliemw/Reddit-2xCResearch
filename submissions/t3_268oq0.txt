Up to 7 years baby-free, insertion was no more painful than really bad menstrual cramps, and most of the pain of having it in is well controlled by ibuprofen. I have a 2 in a thousand chance per year of getting pregnant with unprotected sex with my boyfriend. No pills, no systemic hormones after the first couple months, no injections and no patch. No more pregnancy scares from forgotten pills! And totally reversible!

Viva la Mirena!
