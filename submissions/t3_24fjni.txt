I have to say that this is a very transmisogynistic subreddit. I am not saying the content is bad, but rather, the sheer name of it makes many transwomen, myself included, feel unwelcome in a women's space. There are plenty of names for a women's subreddit that don't make a subset of women feel unwelcome. I just don't understand why y'all chose a name like that.
