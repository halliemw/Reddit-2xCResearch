Hey ladies! I'm considering proposing in the near future to my boyfriend of 2 and a half years, but have some reservations:

1) I've always pictured the guy proposing... but don't actually have a problem with 'stepping up' and doing it.

Women who've asked - does this stupid standard ever bother you in the back of your mind and you *kinda, sorta* wish you'd've waited for him to do it?


2) Will he be offended that I didn't wait for him to get the courage? 

He's very introverted but super romantic. I can tell he's genuinely thinking about it because of the glint in his eyes whenever the topic comes up (on tv, in our jokes, him *really* wanting my very intimidating dad to like him, etc.), but our first "I love you" story is of me stealing the words from him (I *knew* he was about to say it, he was teary eyed and nervous) and he says he was relieved. Not sure if proposing marriage is something he'd be relieved about if I beat him to it, too.... 


3) How did you do it? 

I love turning insignificant moments into important ones! So I'd probably do it during a walk, at breakfast, when he comes home from work, or right when we're waking up... 

Did you have a ring? Did you drop to one knee? Did he repsond the way you expected?


**I hope some of you are able to tell some fun stories!** 

Advice is welcome, as well! :)
