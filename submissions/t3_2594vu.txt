So, I have a giant ass for my frame. I love it. It's a badonkadonk butt, and I think it's delightful. I bounce it like a basketball as a party trick. So I'm pretty comfortable with my lovely lady lumps.

HOWEVER, it makes buying underwear and swimwear and giant pain in my giant ass. All those tiny triangle pieces of material that leave 3/4 of my ass hanging out, which is not only hella uncomfortable, but it looks overly... sexual I guess. Like im wearing a thong, when I dont wanna look like that.

SO, after having serious problems finding it stores, I googled "swimwear for big bums" and all other variations of such a term and all I could find was "flattering suits for hiding yo' fat ass" etc.

HOLY SHIT ladies I'm pissed. All I'm looking for is a bottom with a bit more coverage, not the judgement and insistance that I want to "flatter" or "hide". Half of the links were for tummy shapers etc. I'm so upset.

I guess I'm just venting, but if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
