Welcome to a post that doesn't hype up Frozen!

I've personally been bothered by the fact that Elsa and Anna from Frozen look identical ever since the movie came out. I never gave it much thought and assumed I was just lacking attention to detail. Eventually it drove me nuts enough to do a little research and I came across this blog. 

The writer describes something called "same face syndrome" as well as goes through Disney's animation evolution that leads up to Elsa and Anna's character design. However, the student stops writing, going only as far as her "expertise" allowed, steering clear from the sensitive topic of women and beauty which leaves the reader to ponder what suggestions Disney may be subtly  making to society. I was wondering what you ladies, and perhaps gentlemen, thought about this topic in regards to the blog's inferences and whether or not this is offensive to woman.
