I'm 17 and still go to a pediatrician lol.  I'm not on birth control or anything and am 0% sexually active, so don't really see a reason to go to a gyno, however I will be starting college in the fall so I don't really know where I'll be sexually in 6 months.  Should I go?  Am I late in not having gone to one already?  I kind of have no idea what the norm for this is, and I don't think my mom knows either.
