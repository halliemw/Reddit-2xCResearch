Where I grew up, it was a sign of respect that was almost expected to reply "Yes ma'am/sir." to any adult you were speaking to. As I've grown into a young adult, I've still held onto it. It's polite, it's respectful, and to be honest it's kind of an ingrained trigger response at this point. 

For the past few years, maybe now that I'm visibly not a "child" anymore, whenever I use "ma'am" or "sir" I get awful responses. Today I was at a dress fitting and two other women were there getting fittings as well. One asked if my dress was a bridesmaids dress and I responded immediately, with a smile "Yes ma'am it is." To which both of them hissed their breath and pulled out the standard - "Don't call me ma'am! I'm not THAT old!" They then went on about how I looked 17 (I'm 22) and just made me feel bad and uncomfortable for the entire fitting. 

Why is there a negative connotation with "ma'am"? Why do we immediately feel the need to correct strangers by pointing out how young we are? Is this a habit I need to rid myself of?



EDIT: Thanks for all of the input! It's crazy to see the differences based on what region you're from.
