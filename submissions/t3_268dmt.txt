I was in this relationship once. His name isn't important and he was emotionally abusive. I stayed because I was 19 and he was my first boyfriend, first sexual experience, first fight, first love. He wanted me to be completely shaven. That was the only way his little bare mouth would even consider heading south (birds of a feather, maybe).

My Dad's Italian and I'm Italian and our hair is resilient. Shaving became something I dreaded because it never turned out okay. I'm not fucking flexible. I can't hold my leg up over my head, bent around my shoulder just so I can get that patch of hairs around my inner labia - but I did. Every. Other. Day. Sometimes it paid off. Other times I had to sit on the toilet after unsatisfying sex, just looking at the red bumps all over me. 

We broke up. And I didn't shave for a very long. Having a bush is fun. There's always something to twiddle with while you're on the phone with loved ones. Periods suck less. Sometimes it tickles your inner thigh, like "Hey girl, you're not alone." 

But now that summer's here, I want to wear revealing bikinis because I'm lifting and I fucking want to. Today, I turned on Kanye, plopped down in front of my mirror, spread 'em, and brought it around town for forty minutes. Every once and a while I'd stand up and dance, just looking at myself, trying to decide which parts of me were newly emerging muscle groups or merely shadows. 

When I was done, my pussy looked beautiful. I mean fucking immaculate. Never have I ever had such a clean shaven vagina. I literally just looked at myself for like fifteen minutes, appreciating a part of me that I have been shamed into thinking was ugly and unappealing for more than a year. 

And it was great.
