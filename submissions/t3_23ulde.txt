I went to see my boyfriend at work during his break today, as usual (it's a routine), where we have a heated emotional discussion. I cried but it wasn't dramatic waterworks and I really tried to keep it on the low. We settle things but my emotions are still a little shaken and he walks me to the traffic light to send me off back towards home. We kiss, but it's not making out, more like long pecks? I then feel a hand graze my butt and I turn around to see this white guy smirking at me (I'm 21 and 5'4" and I don't look my age). 


I stood there, shocked and speechless and my boyfriend was both shocked and speechless as well but shaking in anger. Before anything can escalate, I pull my boyfriend back all while the guy smirks at us.


We leave in the opposite direction, my boyfriend fuming and me in tears again from the shock but not crying. I just got home and I'm so numb about this whole evening - am I being melodramatic? I don't know if this puts this into more context but I've been sheltered by my parents my whole life so I've never experienced anything 'bad' before; the worst has been catcalling which made me feel sick but this was physical and I'm just numb. A part of me feels relieved that it was just a graze of the guy's hand, not a grab or squeeze. I feel like I should have did something like shouted at the guy but I was just quivering there trying to restrain my boyfriend because I didn't want a scene. Another part of me feels like it's my/our fault we shouldn't have just stood there kissing and attracting creeps. I don't even know what happened to me - was I molested? Sexually harassed? My mind is all over the place from that disgusting incident and that earlier discussion I had with my boyfriend.


**tl;dr: Was kissing my boyfriend when a stranger touches my butt. I was too shocked to do anything but pull my boyfriend back and away from hitting this guy. I feel numb.**
