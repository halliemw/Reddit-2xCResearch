I've had all the usual PMS symptoms this month.

Pissed at the world

Migraines (Edit: Now that I'm thinking about it, I actually haven't been getting migraines this month, which is highly unusual for me)

5,000 calorie diet...

Only I've also been experiencing some that I've never had in the past. The whole week before my period (which I've had about 24 hours now) I've had sensitivity to smells and an overly heightened gag reflex. I work with babies and have been changing diapers for 8 years and now I suddenly find myself almost throwing up. In one case I actually DID throw up. I can't seem to wipe noses without feeling sick either, and strong smells such as cooking food completely ruin my appetite. My stomach just can no longer handle anything. 

Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? Do I have to get used to changing diapers again after 8 years of no problems, or will this go away?   

It is not possible for me to be pregnant. I've never even SEEN a penis on an adult outside of porn, let alone done the hankey pankey with one.
