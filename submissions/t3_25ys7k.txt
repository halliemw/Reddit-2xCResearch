I found out I was pregnant this morning via a urine test. I took two individual tests and both came out positive. I am 5 weeks along (first day of last period was 5 weeks ago). I am very sure I want to terminate this pregnancy but my main concern is just taking care of this issue ASAP for peace of mind. 

The doctor at planned parenthood told me I have two options, taking an abortion pill or an in-clinic suction abortion (surgical option). I really need some advice on what route to go on. I understand it's ultimately my decision but I wanted some advice.

The pill option: I can take it this Wednesday. The cons are that I've read it might not work and I might need to follow up with surgery. Also it seems like it's really painful and can last a long while. 

The surgical option: I would have to wait until the 31st (this would make me in my 7th week). The pros are that it seems like I know then and there it was effective in terminating the pregnancy (is this true?). Also, it would be less painful/disruptive and quick. It's just that it kinda makes me nervous to sit here and do nothing but wait for 2 weeks to take care of this issue.

Ultimately, I'm torn between the two because I want to get this over with as soon as possible but I also want to know it's done for good when I go through with it.

Can anyone help me? Thank you so much.
