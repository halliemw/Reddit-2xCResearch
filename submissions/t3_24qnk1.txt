Hey Reddit,

I'm a 21 year old female (obviously) and I lost my virginity to my boyfriend of two years last week. We used a condom, lube, and he my boyfriend didn't even cum. We had messed around naked earlier in the month but he never penetrated without a condom. He was rubbing this dick on my clit to tease me.

My typical cycle comes about every 25 days, but it can happen anywhere from 24-27 days. My period was predicted to come yesterday but it didn't. I keep thinking I'm having cramps, but it feels more like ovarian pain than my usual cramps.I also think I'm having cramps but it's just gas. I know the odds of precum getting a girl pregnant are exponentially low, but I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If it doesn't come tomorrow, it'll be past the 27 day mark and I've never had a period that late.

I'm hoping it's just stress that's pushing my period back. I've dealt with finals during my cycle and the lost of my virginity, which I've been struggling with. I wasn't sure if I made the right choice and it's weighed on me. I'll take a test on the weekend if it doesn't show up, I know it's too soon to take it now.

**TL;DR**: Help me ease my mind that I'm probably not pregnant
