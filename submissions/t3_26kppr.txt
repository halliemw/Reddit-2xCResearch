I made a throwaway because other people I know know my other Reddit handle. In 2008 I was 'sort of' seeing this guy who was a friend of mine. I met him my Freshman year at University (2006) and I had always liked him. I knew that he was interested in me sexually, and he respected my not wanting to do anything. The one night I decided to, I clearly stated that he could ONLY touch me from the waist up, nothing below. 

So we made out for a while, and he just shoved his hand down my pants. I froze. I couldn't really speak. I'm a highly emotional person, and honestly, I just remember crying, and asking him to please take me home. I've told other people my story and they said that I was assaulted, but I'm not entirely sure if it is since it could've been worse. I also find it strange that it's 2014, and it STILL bothers me. 

I've since found out that I'm gay and I've been with a great girl for going on a year this June.
