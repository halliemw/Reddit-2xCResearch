I'm nervous, but excited...I've wanted to get a Brazilian wax for a while now, but thought it would be pointless since I wasn't wearing bathing suits in the colder weather. But now at 23 years old, I'm getting my first wax. I've had my eyebrows done before, but that's the extent of my waxing experience. Any advice?
