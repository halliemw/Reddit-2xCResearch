My good friend's husband [m 42] "found Jesus" a few years ago.  His wife and mother of his two children is not religious.  He has become increasing devoted, almost brainwashed like a cult member.  He constantly worries his wife and children are going to hell if they are not "saved".  He has begun putting church over work and family, using the phrase "gods will" to justify bad choices, and giving money to the church that they cannot afford.
He is a good kind person.  My heart is breaking because his marriage is at risk and I think that will create a further downward spiral.  How do I help and support my friend?
