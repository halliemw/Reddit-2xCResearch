Why can't this sub just be about empowering women for who they are/what they do, not what they look like. Society tells women all the time that the most important and valuable thing they can do is look good. I thought this sub was better than that. I think mods should ban photos that are about how confident a woman feels due to weight loss, how confident a woman feels solely due to a change in appearance, or similar things. Photos like that are posted and upvoted constantly in r/pics and r/staymotivated. This should be a place free from the focus on superficiality that bombards women constantly elsewhere.
