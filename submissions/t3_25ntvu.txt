Hey gals and guys,
I'm involved in a few online communities and I witness so much sexism and women and men either condoning it or being told "you're making a big deal out of nothing" if they say something. I'm a college student soon entering the tech industry (programming/engineering) and I've read so much about at both well established and start up companies, the issues with sexism affecting work and how speaking up can lead to being fired or being forced to quit due to harassment from reporting or because the company pressures women not to report... 

I try to be positive, but how can I ignore all these things. I just want to cry after using ethos, pathos, and logos to try and show my perspective and still don't make a dent in peoples thinking. 

I'm familiar with the old man and the starfish story (http://www.esc16.net/users/0020/FACES/Starfish%20Story.pdf) but it doesn't make me feel much better, because no one else is helping the starfish. 

I just get so sad and discouraged, and mixed with other things it makes me wonder why I even bother with anything.
