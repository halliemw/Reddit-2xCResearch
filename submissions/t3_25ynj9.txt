Any of you ladies skip out on the Bachelor's? I've been in college for three years (have two years left because of Uni transfer and failed classes) and I just can't seem to get my shit together, or care enough about class. I'm majoring in Flute Performance and my passion for flute has died with deadlines, and it just gets increasingly worse with my ever increasing social anxiety. I feel like I'm just not doing what I really want to do. 

I would love to get my Bachelor's degree, but I feel like that's only because I have no idea what else to do. I don't want kids, I don't want money (my only regret is I won't be able to help my family out of their poor financal position), I just feel like I'm wasting my time here. Should I finish my degree? Anyone else choose a different path with an encouraging story?

If this isn't the best subreddit for this, I understand, and will ask to remove it. I just wanted TwoX opinions. <3
