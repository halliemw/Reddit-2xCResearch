There are 9 people on my team, including our manager.  I am the only woman.  (For what it's worth, we're software engineers.)

He consistently holds me to a higher standard than everyone else, and not in an "I know you can do more" way but in a "the bar to accomplish the same thing as everyone else is gonna be higher for you" way.

I was the first person to be hired onto the team to do a certain line of work, but I've never been allowed to do that line of work because I "don't have enough experience," but several of the male employees that we brought in after me had less experience than I do.  One of them had NO experience.  I've been dealing with this for more than a year and a half, and he still says I'm "not ready".

Every time I've talked with him and he's told me what i need to do to be ready, once I've done all those things, he says that I'm not ready and gives me a new list.  No one else has ever had to do anything of the sort.

Without prompting, more than one of my teammates has brought up to me that it seems like our boss is discriminating against me because I'm a woman.  I agree, because at this point, it's the only difference between me and anyone else on the team.

So how do I address this?  Do I talk to his boss, the head of our department?  Or do I go to HR, which is in another state?

I really feel like the only way to get to do the work I want is to get a new job, but I shouldn't have to do that when I've worked so long and hard for it and the boss just won't let me do it.

What do I do?
