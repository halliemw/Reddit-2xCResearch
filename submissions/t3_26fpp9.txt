I hope I can submit to this subreddit about this - I am new but I need to ask.


I've been having trouble with sex with my boyfriend for a few months, penetration stings a lot, and it feels like I'm being ripped, so we don't have sex anymore. I've been to see a doctor, however I was told nothing was wrong, even though there clearly is as it's been a recurring issue for some time. Any ideas on what could be wrong? :(
