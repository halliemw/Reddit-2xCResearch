A bit of back story: I'm graduating from college in a couple of days and he said he wanted to go out with me as sort of a graduation present. So, I said okay and we were all set to go out to dinner today and then to go see Godzilla, when his father asked the household who wanted to go with him to see Godzilla. He told his dad that we were going to see it tonight, and invited him to go with us. Now, I have no problem with his dad at all, but I'm not quite sure what to think about this... 

Whenever I'm confused or upset I try to put myself in their shoes, because that seems to work for most of my problem solving with reading people's reasoning behind their actions. However, I thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that I would have at least ASKED him if it was okay if my father could come with us. I mean, it's common courtesy, am I right?

Though half of me feels ridiculous for being bothered by this. I haven't even brought it up to him because I feel so dumb about being bothered by it. :( If you agree with this, then please tell me I'm being dumb and disregard this! Maybe I just need someone to tell me that I'm wrong and why...
