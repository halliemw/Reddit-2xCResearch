Sorry if this isn't the right sorta thing for this subreddit!  I couldn't find a more general health advice one and I figured this is pretty female-specific.

Basically what it says in the title - I find myself getting moderate to severe cramps that are literally exactly like period cramps - same place, same sensation etc - but regardless of where I am in my cycle.  This usually happens when I'm doing cardio in an upright position (e.g. running/on an elliptical), not so much if I'm cycling or doing weights-y stuff.  They can be REALLY bad.  A few times I've had to stop and sit/crouch down and just wait for them to subside before I can physically do anything.  However they always go away after about 10 minutes and then I feel right as rain again.

I have no idea how common this is, I've told both my closest female friends and they have never experienced it. I also don't know if its anything to be concerned about.  Interestingly, I came off the pill a few months ago and I feel like its been a more prevalent problem since then, although I've definitely experienced it when I've been on it as well.

Any advice/wisdom/shared experiences would be awesome!  If it sounds like something I should see a doctor about that would be cool to know (I'm only not doing it already as the wait times for an appointment are RIDICULOUS right now and the drop-in clinics are always rushed).
