Okay, first off I have never had children so I was prewarned: it will be way more painful to get the IUD inserted because of that. And yes, turns out everyone was right. I couldn't even get past the measuring of my cervix!!

Well, the place I went to told me to take a few IB Profens beforehand and I'd be good to go. Well, that wasn't the case...I really have no pain tolerance at all apparently. Which I thought I could handle it since I've gotten a Colposcopy before and that wasn't too bad. But, this was WAY WORSE.

So, now I get to come back next month (so I'm doing the pill thing until then) and I've been prescribed Percocet and Xanax which I"m supposed to take an hour before I attempt to get it inserted again. My wonderful fiance has agreed to drive me there for when the time comes. 

My question, ladies, is will it hurt as bad with the pain pills as it did without them? I know pain is relative, but has anyone here ever gotten the IUD inserted without having children before and having taken prescribed pain meds beforehand? I really want to go the IUD since it is so effective and I won't have to remember to have pills on me at a certain time every day. 

I feel like a big pansy, but I couldn't handle the pain of even getting a measure of my cervix and that wasn't even supposed to be all that painful lol, the IUD was supposed to be worse, but I stopped the procedure before it got to that point. 

I am looking for the truth so I can use this month to prepare myself, because I still plan on getting it during my next period. I am hoping that with the pain meds beforehand it will be rather less painful. 

Thanks!!! 

EDIT: THANKS EVERYONE FOR THE WONDERFUL ADVICE!! I am much more ready and informed for the IUD than I was prior to today and next month I'll be all set and good to go! I appreciate the responses :)
