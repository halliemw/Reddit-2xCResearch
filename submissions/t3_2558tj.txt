Since I haven't really seen this tip anywhere else, and didn't figure something obvious out until I turned 28, I thought this little tidbit might help out some of the younger ladies who run across this: 

Go out and by a ton of black cotton underwear. Bikini, thong, granny panties, it doesn't matter what type. I did this a few years ago and wear my black knickers approximately three days before my period, during my period, and a day or two after I feel it's finished up. I was tired of ruining my lacy, light colored pretty things with "oops! Nature!!" surprises. 

I know this might seem, like I said, obvious; yet I wish I had someone lay down this info on me when I was younger. I could have saved so many garments. 

If you're like me and your period is a torrential murderous downpour, also think about some dark pants or black denim. 

Happy to help even just one fellow redditor :D
