I just recently posted to /r/depression because our split hit me pretty hard. But I found out after the split that he had cheated on me. Three times in our 6 year span. We have two children, 5years and 2years old. I was hurt, but not overly surprised. Sadly. But I want to make it work. Am I crazy? I honestly don't know where my head is right now...
