(Using a throwaway, will explain)

This sub looks like a great place and for the most part the banter looks friendly, positive, and supportive from both the men and women that respond but the few times I tried to participate (using my main account) I've been harassed, berated, and received very uncomfortable PMs not only outlining how useless I am but also that I should kill myself and deserve to be raped and have my body mutilated. I've never received such foul comments posting on other subs, only here. 

As much as I'd love to be an active member some of the responses make me genuinely feel useless, stupid, and maybe I should kill myself. It really does not feel like a safe place for anybody, let alone women, to post about anything personal.

Is there an unwritten rule about posting guidelines that I should know about so I might be able to become a contributing member?
