  I'm not sure where to start this story, it's both a rant and a plea for advice. 
 I work in food service, it's hard work an little pay. Too little pay and too much hard work to deal with this creep we call Glenn. Glenn is a middle aged man, possibly with Asperger's syndrome who comes into my job every morning and night like clockwork. That part is fine, everybody's gotta have something, right?

  He's always been creepy, talking about which days you had off that week, what color shirt you were wearing the other day, etceterA. But lately, oh lately he's been stepping up his creep game and pushing his creep boundaries. Standing almost completely on the line asking the new girl when she's getting off, making drinks and asking the cashier girls to try it- walking around the restaurant looking for us on out breaks and touching a coworkers back last night.

   Management has, on several occasions told him he's not allowed to talk to us on our breaks, much less come find us to do so. They're all aware of his recent behavior but do nothing about it other than say "no Glenn" our general manager is tired of talking to him and is hardly ever around even if he would do something about it. Glenn doesn't bother the assistant managers and they're apathetic about his behavior. 
 
 It's not okay too feel creeped out by guests at work, and I have rights as an employee- but what do we do when nobody can be bothered to enforce those rights? What do we do about Glenn? 

 Apologies about the wall of text, I needed to tell this story, I need somebody with an idea of what to do.
