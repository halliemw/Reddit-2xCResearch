So, in the spirit of TwoXChromosomes' TMI threads, tomorrow I will be going to hot springs. And my period visited today. 2 FRIGGING WEEKS EARLY!! But I have tampons (better safe than sorry... especially in foreign countries. Am I right or am I right?). Thing is, I've only used tampons 3 or 4 times before, so I'm not sure if it'll last me, since we'll be at the hot springs all day. I have a fairly light flow, but I'm worried it'll leak if we're going to be there for between 7-9 hours. Plus it's in the middle of the countryside, so I can't really change it. Will it last or will I just have to find an excuse to sit out for a while, and only swim a little bit? Also, I'm worried about the string popping out. Eww... this is probably the grossest thing I've ever written a post about.
