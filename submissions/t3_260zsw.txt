2X, help me work through this, iron out my thoughts, figure out how to proceed... (I feel this may be (more) appropriate for another subreddit or two as well, but I know you all and I trust you all, and wanted to try here.)

My boyfriend (29) is the best man I've ever met. He is loving, doting, faithful, smart, interesting, funny, sweet, a great communicator, fun to be around, active, has wonderful friends and a close and amazing family, and he's as handsome as they come. 

I (28) happen to also think I'm pretty great, and share many many of the same qualities he does. We've been together almost 2 years and living together for 8 months. Boyfriend and I laugh together, we (make) love together, we cry together, we stress together, and we talk. We don't argue or fight really. Friends all agree we're great together.

What's the problem? 

**He's Christian and I'm not.**

(I'm nothing and prefer not to even say Atheist or Agnostic.)

*It doesn't come up in day-to-day life*: we both try to keep a lid on it - he doesn't regularly go to church so it doesn't come up every Sunday either. He is 100% a believer in Jesus Christ being his Lord and Savior, though, and he prays (like really, really prays a lot about everything) and thanks God and feels blessed every day. He had a very very rough childhood and I don't begrudge him his beliefs at all. They bring him peace and love and he doesn't use them as a weapon against anyone or anything, so I very much respect his personal brand of loving God and Jesus, although I don't share it. In other words, he is very much a firm/strong believer, and not at all ambivalent or light-handed about it.

*It comes up when we talk about our future.* Whether we could marry. How we'd raise our kids. What would happen as we aged, grew old, and died. We've pondered not having kids. We've pondered not getting married, and just going on with our day-to-day. I've told him I can accompany him to church (we've gone a couple times). I can hold his hands as he prays. I can continue to respect and encourage his emotional and religious growth. But I just don't share it. 

We've been having rough talks lately and it came to a head last night when something in him finally clicked and he got the notion that our relationship is a trial, and Satan knows him so well and has tempted him with me and my dis-belief (he loves me so incredibly much that he considered for a teeny tiny second, abandoning his faith/turning his back on God), and all the sudden it is so very clear to him that he cannot marry and have a life with me if I do not believe. 

*He wants me to believe.* Part of me wishes I did - things would be wonderful for us, and maybe I'd get some of the peace and assurance that his beliefs bring him (and I could certainly use another source of strength/calm/love in my life). But the other part of me really truly does not believe and cannot wrap my head around faith and the concept of God and Jesus and there being one right religion, etc. I've never felt lost or empty or alone, and have never had a desire to be saved, found, or any of that. I cannot fake it, either. 

Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been through anything similar? Should I try to become a believer by surrounding myself with it, and just see what happens? Help.

**TL;DR: I could have the man of my dreams and continue living our wonderful life, if only I believed in and loved God.**

FWIW, I'm in therapy, he's tried therapy (still looking for the "right one"), and we have our first couples therapy appointment tomorrow. Shit just hit the fan last night and I'm struggling to make it through the day, let alone all the way til tomorrow evening. We slept apart last night. 

**Edited to say:** Thank each and every one of you so much for your thoughts, advice, insight, and sharing your experiences. I've read (and will continue to) each comment, and they've all helped me. As always, I'm glad to be a part of this community, and thankful to have you all.
