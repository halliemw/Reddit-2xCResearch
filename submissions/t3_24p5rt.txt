I recently moved 7,000 miles away from home to work at a job that will enable me to pay off my debts from college. I was in a relationship with a girl that I loved very much, and we tried the long distance thing, but it didn't work out. We were together for 4 years almost, so it is a bit hard to end that and be in a new place where I don't speak the language and I am unable to find much of an expat community. 

So lately I have been using OKC a lot to meet people. I am bisexual, but it is hard to find women here. Men are easy. And I have been meeting up with guys, sleeping with them on the first date. One of these people I am considering making a relationship with, but for the most part it is more or less a one off kind of deal. In the 3 months I have been here, I have already been with 8 different people - and I am totally enjoying myself. I am single and young and feeling sexy, but then the next day I beat myself up for being a whore. I am doing what I want to do 100% and am okay with doing this stuff, but I still can't get that nagging "you slut!" voice out of my head.

So how can I get over that part of my mind and just enjoy myself? How can I be confident that if it makes me happy there is nothing wrong with it? Sure, I am lonely and maybe that is part of the reason I am doing it, but who cares, right? Yet I still can't shut that voice out. Pls help.
