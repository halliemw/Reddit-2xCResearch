I run right now 2 miles every morning and am trying to add a miles every week or two weeks. Long story short i am starting my period and i am so exhausted no matter how much i sleep on that week that today i just stayed home today. I get this every month, it is the week before i get my period and during. I cannot just not workout for two weeks in a month.
