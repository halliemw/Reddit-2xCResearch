[Article Here](http://m.playboyplus.com/playground/view/id/4694/title/playboy-forum-the-doctor-is-out) Found this gem in a recent issue of Playboy. Long and short of it is more women are going off to med school, which in turn creates more competition for guys to get in. Since apparently women aren't as career focused as guys, as soon as a female doctor gets her diploma she'll take lots of hours off to have 12 babies and not work as hard as if a guy had gone to med school in her place. Worst part? This is the most sexist thing I have ever read in a modern magazine, and it was written by a woman.
