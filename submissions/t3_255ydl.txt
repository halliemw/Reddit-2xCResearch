I'm 23 and moved to a new city about 2 years ago.

I'm out of college and spend my 9-5 sitting at a desk doing mundane work, go home, see my boyfriend, cook, and relax. Not very exciting.

With my minor social anxiety I find it really difficult to make friends, especially with other women. I can start and hold a polite conversation, but it never seems to 'blossom' into a friendship. I never get the number or set up a date to get coffee, it never feels like the right time and I find I'm never approached by someone else looking for friendship.

I've been thinking of joining a class at my local gym, but even if I were to do that, I'm not super outgoing and know I'd probably miss a few golden opportunities.



So I'm here for help from you lovely ladies!

Any women have tips on how you'd like to be "picked up" by a girl looking for friendship? 

How do you approach other females you want to be friends with?
