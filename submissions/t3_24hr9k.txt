What's the longest you've gone without really interacting with anyone? I find myself being able to go almost a week without any quality social/human interaction and that's scary. I don't even want to count how many Saturdays it's been now that I've spent by myself. I mean, I guess it's a good thing that I fall more on the introverted side, but it still sucks. 

Despite my many attempts at expanding my social circle, I always find myself feeling very lonely because I just don't have that many friends. I don't need a lot of friends (quality over quantity) but the downfall to that is when my friends are all out of town, busy, or off doing things I'm not interested in (e.g. bar hopping or clubbing), I find myself alone, wishing for human interaction but not having anyone to reach out to.  I'm starting to dread the question, "How/what did you do this weekend?" I can fill my schedule with classes and volunteering to keep myself busy, but the interaction I get with people then isn't always enough. Even though I know I'm not ready to date, I find myself almost wanting to find a relationship just so I have a built in hang out buddy. I don't like that mindset, but it just goes to show how frustrated I am I guess. =/

Anyways, the point of this post isn't asking how to change my situation (and meet new people,etc.), as I already know how... but I'm more interested in how you lovely ladies spend your time, and how you deal/cope with being alone and/or the possible loneliness that can come with that.
