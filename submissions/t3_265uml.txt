I have two kids and found out a couple weeks ago that I'm pregnant again. When my husband and I married, we were both staunchly Catholic and pro life. My husband is even of the opinion that even NFP is sinful without grave reasons and consultation with a priest. I'm not Catholic anymore, a subject I am just starting to broach with my husband, and after the second child was born I started taking birth control. The problem was, I'm a stay at home mother and my husband works from home, so it took some doing to pick up the pills every month without him knowing. I just wasn't able to pick up April's supply in time.

I'm not against a third child, but right now I want to focus on the two we have, get them both walking, talking, out of diapers. I had a miscarriage before the first child and I don't mourn or pine after it, wondering what might have been, even. I don't think I would after terminating this one.

I'm in Missouri. Abortion is legal, but difficult to obtain with only one facility in the state. I think there is now a three day waiting period? In any case I'd probably go across the river into Illinois.

Every summer my husband goes on a week long camping trip with his family. That's when I'd do it, next month. I'd probably have to take the kids and stay in a hotel a couple days, or come up with a reason for my parents to take them. I have no support in this in any way from anyone. No matter, I can do this on my own if need be.
