I just feel like I need to say something to someone who won't judge me. I'm taking a pregnancy test in an hour and I'm a wreck. I'm on the pill and we've been pretty careful but I'm about 5 days late. I mean we've been together 6 years and have had some scares in the past but I always knew I was fine (like in my gut). This is the first time I'm worried. I'm graduating from college next week and we're starting a new chapter of our lives together but I really don't think a baby would be good. I don't know how I let this happen and I feel so miserable and guilty. I feel like there's always a giant obstacle. I'm just freaking the hell out right now and would love some really cool chicks (or dudes) to talk to and ease my mind. 

UPDATE: It was negative! It took awhile for me to take it because I was waiting for my SO to get back with the test and I didn't have to pee. Then we talked for awhile about what we thought was going on. I was sick about a week ago so I think that might have something to do with it too. Maybe the medicines I was taking or something. Either way we're both relieved and now I'm just going to wait it out and not start my next pack of pills until I start my period. Thanks you all for your really kind words. And yes, my SO is amazingly supporting and loving. Tomorrow morning I'll take the second test just to make sure.
