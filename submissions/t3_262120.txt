We have always strived to keep /r/TwoXChromosomes a welcoming forum for open discussion and advice.  We discuss many controversial issues here, and welcome all points of view.

However, /r/TwoXChromosomes also serves as a space for our users to find comfort and support through a variety of hard times in their lives.  It is extremely important to us that we provide a supportive and comforting atmosphere to these users.  Criticisms of individual users and their decisions is not welcome.

In order to facilitate differenciating between threads that welcome debate and threads that don't, we are introducing the voluntary [Support] tag.  Users that wish to post here for unqualified support and comfort may now tag their submission title with [Support], which will indicate that this is a thread for providing comfort and support, not a thread for open discussion.  [Support] tags are to be used only for self posts, article links may not be tagged with a [Support] tag.

**Posts marked with the [Support] tag will be subject to stricter moderation.**  Any comments that could be construed as criticism or judgement of the OP or their choices will be removed in [Support] threads.  This is not a change in moderation policy, but a clarification of what we'd already been attempting to do in an unstructured way.

Examples:
 
In a thread titled *[Support] I had an abortion yesterday*, comments suggesting that abortion is wrong will be removed.  Comments suggesting that the OP made the wrong choice will be removed.  Comments extoling the virtues of adoption will be removed.

In a thread titled *If I get pregnant, should I have an abortion?*, comments suggesting that abortion is wrong are welcome, comments suggesting that abortion is right are welcome, comments extoling the virtues of adoption are welcome, comments criticizing the adoption process are welcome.


Regardless of what type of thread you are posting in, please always remember rule #1 in our sidebar:
>Respect: No hatred, bigotry, assholery, misogyny, misandry, transphobia, homophobia, racism or otherwise disrespectful commentary. Please follow reddiquette.

Happy tagging!
