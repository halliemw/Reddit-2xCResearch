Some back story, tonight was a farewell bonfire party to some exchange students. We are all 15-16. I bought the food, firewood and planned everything. The party is awesome for the first few hours then some kids who weren't invited showed up and everything went to shit. 

A brief overview.

* I was called a bitch for asking no one to bring alcohol (we would get suspended or expelled because it's considered school time)
* I was made fun of for having dark leg hair, which means you can see my hair follicles even if I shave.
* I was told I had small tits
* I was called fat because I didn't want to take off my shorts while swimming (I have really bad stretch marks and don't shave my pubic hair because I am lazy and have sensitive skin)
* My best friend told me not to be jealous of her because she was about to kiss a boy and I was not.
* My other best friend went off and flirted with the guy who made fun of my small breasts and dark hair. For three hours. Even though she said she hated him, though now it seems she loves the attention. This guy hash-tags his own selfies with, #handsome, #goodlooking. 
* Kids started lighting random stuff on fire. The 'random stuff' was my belongings I had brought for the party, i.e. bags of chips, tubs I carried the stuff in, some paper towels. 

This does not do justice to hell-hole that was disguised as a party. 

Everything that happened is so trivial but it adds up over time and I'm just worn out. My thick skin can't protect for this long. 

I go to a school that has maybe 40 kids within the grade, 12 of them being female. It is a K-12 private school and I have now been with these kids for five years (I transferred in grade 5.) I was hoping maybe I could just disappear, float away. But in a school this small it's impossible.

But my question is, with two years of high school left, should I move schools? Is it better in a bigger school where the kids aren't stuck up private schoolers who love to prove that mommy and daddy didn't shelter them? 

Have any of you changed schools this late in the game? What kind of school should I go for? Public, private? 

Any advice would be lovely. I'm sitting in my room right now just frustrated and over-whelmed, so much so that I feel like crying.
