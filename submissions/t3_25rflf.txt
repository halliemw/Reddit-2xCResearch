I know that he's probably just trying to be helpful, but I'm sick and tired of hearing this stuff. I told him once or twice before that I dress according to my own style (which isn't unattractive either) and that I appreciate his fashion advice and I might give it a shot sometime. 

Like for example, he's been telling me to wear thigh high socks, colored pants (like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8CcsKERqNI/T4H6h8qiyGI/AAAAAAAAC-k/aaGJWOgWA10/s1600/mint+jean+options.jpg) or [this](http://forelyse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mint-Sk1.jpg)), super tight sweater dresses in the fall (like [this](http://image.venusswimwear.com/is/image/Venus/Z9893BKWH.22?$ProductPage380x532$)), leggings instead of jeans or jeggings, etc. 

I feel like he's trying to tell me how to dress and it makes me SO fucking mad sometimes because I know that he's just getting ideas from other women he sees in the media/around town. He makes me feel like I'm Plain Jane even though I think I'm not. 

I always refrain from ever being anything but polite when talking with him about the manner. I'm sure he is just trying to give me some genuine advice. But in the back of my head, I'm asking myself "Why is he telling me how to dress "hotter"? Why does he think that I need his help? Am I that bad? Am I not good-looking enough?"

It's even MORE infuriating because, truth be told, he's pretty average-looking himself. He's nothing like the men I see in the media/around town but I never fucking ever tell him how to dress so that he looks "hotter." 

Whenever he tries on something, I'm always so supportive of him. It's not that I always like his style, either; I'm honest with him so if needed, I kindly let him know if something is not flattering on him, and he always takes my opinion seriously, which is nice. 

Whenever I *DO* try to step out of my comfort zone a bit and try something new, 7 out of 10 times I pick out something, he always just makes me feel like my selection is "ok." He's only impressed when I pick out something that he has specifically mentioned would look "hot" on me or something of the same caliber. 

SO WHAT IF I LIKE TO DRESS SIMPLY? SO WHAT IF I DON'T LOOK LIKE GIRLS IN THE MEDIA? SO WHAT IF I'M NOT FASHIONABLE? I wish he'd just SHUT THE FUCK UP and be happy with and supportive of how I dress/look! 

I LOVE HIM BUT WHENEVER HE DOES SHIT LIKE THIS, I JUST RAGE SO HARD INTERNALLY. I'M SO TIRED OF IT. And I don't have the guts to tell him all that I've written here because deep down, I know that he's just trying to be nice/helpful BUT HE'S ACTUALLY DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
