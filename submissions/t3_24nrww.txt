Hey Ladies, as my title says, I need some help. 
My youngest sister, 14, is self harming/drinking/doing drugs. My parents immediately went to action when they found out and found a really wonderful therapist that specializes in girls her age with these exact issues, so that's not what I need advice on. 

The issue is this- she has really poor self esteem. She gets down about how she looks, and that manifests in aggression towards me/my mother and self harming. She is the youngest of 4 girls, 7 years younger than my twin and I, and 11 years younger than our oldest sister. She is really into fashion (think [Rookie](http://www.thestylerookie.com)), but does not dress her body type well. In fact, she dresses very poorly.  I'm not sure how to go about talking to about dressing her body type better when she talks to me about her unhappiness with her appearance. 

She gets EXTREMELY hostile if you even so much as mention that the way she dresses is in any way, shape, or form bad, so I don't know what to do. I think she would be happier if she dressed to her body type more, but I can't figure out how to talk to her about it. Any suggestions? I know this is jumbled, so feel free to ask question to clarify
