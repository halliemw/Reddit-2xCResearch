I've always thought of myself as high risk for breast cancer due to my family history. My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 bilateral breast cancer at the of 31, before it was even recommended she get a mammogram. She died at age 36 due to her cancer. My grandmother had breast cancer, as did her sister and her mother. It's always seemed somewhat inevitable.

My general practice doctor has been very dismissive of my concerns and has denied my requests for a mammogram as I am only 24, despite knowing my family history. 

So I finally made an appointment with a generic counselor. I know I won't find anything out in my first appointment specific to my genes and my prognosis, but I'm still terrified. 

I know there are many options for how to deal with a positive BRCA genetic mutation, but I am just stuck on the thought of removing all breast tissue, or as much as possible. I'm only on my parents insurance for 2 more years, and their insurance would cover the vast majority of the cost involved with a radical mastectomy and reconstruction, so that makes me feel like I'm on a timeline. 
I know it's too early to make a decision, but it's constantly on my mind.
