My seventeen year old brother called me and told me that his ex-girlfriend is pregnant and she's pretty sure it's his. She's about four-ish months along and she's keeping it (which is what he wants, too).

He's terrified- "What if I'm not a good dad?" "What if I fuck up this kid's life?" etc.

I don't know what to do- I'm in shock. He's going into his senior year (we really didn't expect him to get this far in school); he's so young.

I don't know how to comfort or support him.. I live two hours away, and I'm just so worried for him.

On the flip side- VERY EXCITED TO (POSSIBLY) BE AN AUNT FOR THE FIRST TIME!!!
