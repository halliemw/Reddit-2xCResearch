Hi everyone,

I'm new here, so please forgive any Reddit-newbie errors. And if this is the wrong place for this, let me know and I'll remove it immediately.

I'm just curious: I saw this article on the Washington Post website last week: Mixed-status HIV couples have babies the old fashioned way: http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/as-mixed-status-hiv-couples-weigh-risks-more-choose-to-conceive-the-old-fashioned-way/2014/04/24/8c8b11a4-b9d4-11e3-96ae-f2c36d2b1245_story.html

I started thinking what I would ask of couples who fit this description. If you had a chance to ask (respectful) questions of these women, what would you ask? What would you most want to know?

I think I'd want to know how they weigh the risk. Like, how do you get to a comfort level with the risk that you might get HIV? What does that mean to them? And did you always want to have a baby, and if so, how did you decide to marry someone with whom having a baby might be impossible?

I don't have kids, and I'm about to turn 40, and I'm really wondering if my current relationship is right for me, since she doesn't want to have kids. So I guess the last one is the most personal for me.

What about you?
