This is not my usual account. Throwaway because my fiance is a redditor and I would prefer he not read my explicit detailing in this even if we have talked about way worse. This is my problem, and would like to see some opinions on it.

When I was in first grade or so, I remember asking my mom what the white residue left in my underwear was. She never really explained it to me, but it continued. It always seemed to leave a nice white seam line of my labia, concentrated at my clit.

It was normal for me to come home and change into gym shorts until my shower, then new underwear in the morning. I did this all through middle school and most of high school. It wasn't that bad. It didn't smell. It didn't make me feel uncomfortably wet during the day.

I took two shots of the Depo Provera starting at the end of Junior year, and over the summer.

The discharge was gone! Nothing. Zip. Nada. No problemo. I was a lot dryer and had to use some sort of lube for banging, but I was fine most of the time.

I went off of the depo shot in February when I moved in with my fiance. It was very gradual for my periods to get semi regular, and now I have had two real periods. For the first time in my life, I am bleeding on my own.

 See, I never started my period without birth control. First time was during the off week on the pills when I was sixteen. Depo was supposed to regulate me. Instead I got the flood of the red tide for a few months.

So now ladies, the root of the problem: I have an overabundance of cervical mucus at night and too much discharge during the day. I can't go back on birth control because I don't know how bad depo might have messed me up. 

Wat do?

I feel gross. Even the old man has started calling me drippy.
