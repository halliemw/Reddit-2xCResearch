My relationship with my mom is still strained by some of the abusive crap she dumped on me and my siblings when we were young. One of the biggest problems I've continued to have with her is her unwillingness to get to know the version of me who lives in the real world, and not just inside her head.

Lately she's been acting just like her usual self up until the point at which I stand up to her, then she caves so completely and utterly I am left standing there going "wtf was that?" Things like gay rights, vibrators, and marijuana she's seemingly turned from her very vocal conservative view in the face of very low-energy "nah, I disagree" all the way to offering to go to a pride parade with me, asking me to take her to a sex-toy shop, and saying she could get a weed card for her myelitis pain and we could try getting high together. In less time than it took you to read that sentence.

It's very hard to know what to make of it, and especially whether or not I can trust it. Actually, given she's in the past taken any information she can find and used it to try and hurt me when she's mad, I'm not sure I will ever really be able to trust it, but it would be nice to know if she's being genuine.

How has your mother-daughter bond evolved, and did any sudden changes actually stick? How do you determine the difference between someone genuinely changing and someone faking it for other purposes?
