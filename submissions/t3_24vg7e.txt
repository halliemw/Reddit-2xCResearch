Sooo my boyfriend broke two Magnums in me this week. 

The first time it happened was Saturday night and we went right to the pharmacy and I took a plan B one step

It happened AGAIN last night. My question is, do I take another Plan B now? This shit is getting expensive but I definitely can't afford to get pregnant.

As far as my Cycle goes, I'm expecting my period within the week.

Also what condoms should we look for now? I guess he's too big or something?

Thank you ladies (and any gentlemen)!
