Since I just discovered this sub when it got added as a default, some (NOT ALL) of the posts I've come across have made me feel like being a woman is a miserable experience.  Between "my vagina is trying to kill me" "tired of feeling like a piece of meat" and labiaplasty questions, I'm  pretty sure I have no way ever to effectively  talk to my daughter about, I dunno, things....

Granted she's still young (going to 5 this summer) I'm still terrified that she's going to be disrespected, taken advantage of and/or not develop a sense of self esteem outside of how men/boys look at her (see also: Bechdel test)  especially since her mother has had a dozen boyfriends that she knows by name. 

Help me understand!

EDIT: Wow, there are a lot of encouraging responses here.  Thank you all for the vote of confidence and support, it takes a village!  I really appreciate the support and advice, wish I could gild you all!
