Forgive if this is tough to read. 

I just want to share that there are good men out there. Many of them I do believe. 

I came home wasted / the room is a little but spinning right now - drunk and horny too. I hopped in bed with my husband of 19 years and wanted to mess around. When he realized how wasted I was he asked me like 3 times - are you sure this is what you want. 

I was sure. It was fine. And now I'm sobering up. 

There are so many stories of non consent and difficult times here. I just wanted to share a good instance because I don't think that my marriage is all that remarkable. I think there are a lot of good men but we just do to talk about our good marriages enough.
