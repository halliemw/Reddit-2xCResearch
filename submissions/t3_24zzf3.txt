I always love the advice this subreddit provides, and I'm not sure where else to ask. So thank you in advance to all the professional/confident women who may help me out.

I've just received a huge promotion and will be the assistant manager in a store with over 60 associates. I will be in charge of teaching, leading, correcting, and assisting these associates. I've been in positions of leadership before, but not to this level.

I was originally confident that I would succeed, but my training has shaken that confidence.  I am young, and look younger than I am.  Many of the associates I will be in charge of have worked in that building longer than I've been alive, and have a reputation for challenging fresh meat.  Despite that, I felt ready.

However, all the people who have been training me have assumed I am not confident, saying things like if I don't toughen up, I will be "chewed up and spit out".  This was based not on my prior leadership skills, because they haven't witnessed those, but based on how I present myself in my interactions. I'm shy, soft spoken, and very quiet until I feel comfortable. The people I've worked with for years have no doubt in my knowledge and skill, but there is a discrepancy in how I am read by those I don't know well.

My question is: what are some tips to exude the confidence I had without coming off as a know it all? What are some tips for addressing or correcting people old enough to be my grandparents, who know as much as I do about our industry? How can I not appear afraid, but not seem naive to the challenges I will face?

I already bought some professional clothing and am considering a haircut, but tips are welcome here as well.

How can I get my confidence to shine through?

Thanks again!
