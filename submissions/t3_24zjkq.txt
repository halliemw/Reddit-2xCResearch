I recently came across a book called **Why does he do that?: Inside the minds of angry and controlling men** by Lundy Bancroft. 

I'm sure a good few of have already heard of it/read it but I thought it would be worth sharing because I'm finding that it gives me a new perspective on abusers and abusive relationships.

You can get it in free pdf form, which is what I've been reading here:

I'm only about 200 pages in, but I'm happy to discuss what I've read so far.
