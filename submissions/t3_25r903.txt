I'm subbed both here to some of the other subreddits linked in the sidebar. I have noticed that, since last week when this became default, there has been a rather steady increase in the amount of trolls, "as a man," and similar things.

In some cases I notice that these trolls are also active in most of the other defaults, and a few I notice them trolling here as well. At this point I am rather certain that there is a rather significant spillover out of twoX and into most of the other women and femininity subreddits. Sadly, I can't think of any real way to stem the torrent of trolls without also cutting off most new membership to our related communities.
