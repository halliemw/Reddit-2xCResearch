Okay, I am using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my redditaccount, and even sometimes reddits from my account so I would be a little embarrassed if he saw this. Anyway, on to my desperate plea for ya'lls help. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years now. He is 30 and I am 26, we live together, have a dog, we know each other's families well (we have traveled with them, gone to holidays with them, done weddings, reunions, etc.). We have discussed our future at length, including buying a house and getting married. We are very happy together and we both know this is what we want. 

So now I guess what I am coming to the group for advice with is not all that unusual a "problem" but I really am at a loss as to how to deal with myself (as in, the problem is me and my own self)

1. I can't stop feeling a little tinge of jealousy when it seems like every person I have ever met, younger, older, or whatever is getting engaged every 10 minutes. -what can I do to just feel happy for everyone else and stop feeling like there is something wrong with me?

2. (and more importantly) How can I stop putting an expectation on every nice, romantic thing we do? I would especially like to remove this association habit with our upcoming summer vacation. I really don't want to think "is this it?" during our whole trip, and then feel any sort of disappointment when I don't come back calling my boyfriend "fianc√©."

I am happy with our relationship, I don't have any reason to believe he is "dragging his feet" or won't propose when he is ready to. I know this is just something I need to stop obsessing over, and I really think part of the obsession stems from the fact that we are both at ages where a lot of our friends and relatives are getting married (we have been invited to 9 weddings over the course of the next 6 months). I know that it *will* happen, I just need to somehow distract myself and stop thinking about *when*. 

**TL/DR:** How can I stop googling engagement rings? Any advice would be so appreciated.  

**ETA:** thanks to everyone for your advice and suggestions. It seems like most comments have been focused on telling me to talk to my boyfriend about getting married/get on the same page about marriage and getting engaged/propose to him. I appreciate all the consideration, I really do. I just want to point out that we have very openly discussed *everything* from life goals, to timelines, to cake, locations and color schemes (all hypothetical of course). I am in no way worried about what he is thinking, whether we will get engaged, if we will get engaged, or if he wants to or doesn't want to. All I am really looking for is ways to live more in the moment and, as I analogized it in one response, stop behaving like a kid looking for Christmas presents in my mom's closet. Thanks everybody!!
