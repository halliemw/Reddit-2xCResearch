Without getting into too many specifics, it was awesome. She is a nurse midwife and can be used as a GP (because of some cool state laws here, apparently), and she spent 2 hours with me, covered a ton of mental, physical, and social health questions, and did a head-to-toe exam, which I don't think I've even gotten since I was a kid. She let me look at my cervix (incredible!) and proscribed an extra strength Naproxen for my horrible monthly crampage, as well as some herbs (herbs!) that will hopefully help my allergies and some other issues. It was incredibly empowering.

Ladies, I know we aren't all this lucky. It has taken me 15 years of gyno visits to actually feel like I am being listened to and heard by someone. I highly recommend seeing a nurse midwife for your annual exams, if that is a possibility in your area. That's all!
