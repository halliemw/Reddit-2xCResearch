As the title implies, I am a ~~man~~ (*Edit:* Wow, first flub right off the bat. I am a male, and I also identify as a man. Sorry about that!) I'm a soon-to-be college grad, and since I've been old enough to comprehend gender issues (or rather, to understand that such issues really do matter), I've been in between the influence of my family (pro-traditional-gender-roles) and my friends (ranging from open-minded moderates to self-proclaimed bra-burning feminists, and I mean that in the best way possible).

I would love to contribute and be a part of this community. I want to learn from women who care about and are affected by these issues, and I want to contribute my own thoughts, as someone who is making an honest effort to be aware of problems faced by women today.

If I'm being honest, though, I've been too scared to post or comment so far. I'm afraid of saying something that might offend someone, or coming across as misogynistic by not using sensitive/appropriate language. I have a friend who brings up gender/feminist topics at a lot of our friendly gatherings, which is great, until I bring up an idea that's different than her way of thinking and get yelled at for being insensitive. I am in no way insinuating that she is a reflection of feminism or women as a whole, and I'm not even trying to say that I'm right, or that she's wrong. It's just a bummer that I can't have real two-way discussions with her about these issues.

So, my question for /r/TwoXChromosomes: is this a good place to start easing into a community where I can learn and discuss? Or is there a better venue out there? Or, on the other side of the coin, might I just need to educate myself better on certain issues before I dive in?
