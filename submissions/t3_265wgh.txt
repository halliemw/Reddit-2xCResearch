Hi 
My name is Sharon and I’ve been studying in a male-dominated field for about a year now. I am one of only two girls in a class of thirty. I am generally treated well and seen as an equal among the guys, though I do overhear the typical sexist-jokes banter from time to time, which I’ve learned not to be bothered by.  

I decided to write to this subreddit because of a recent incident with a one-time tutor who was giving our class a workshop. We had never seen her before, and there is no denying that she was a very attractive woman. Obviously this got all of the guys a bit excited but one of them, - let’s call him Ross, - took it one step further, which has been bothering me ever since. 

Ross asked the guy in front of him to ask this woman a question, so that she would be facing backwards to Ross. When she was in the right position, Ross took out his phone and took a picture of her behind, - with flash, - while she bending over helping the other student. He then proceeded to send this picture to multiple guys in that class who then also shared it.

The whole affair made me incredibly uncomfortable and think less of the guys I’m in class with. What should I do/say?
