I'm sorry for being venty and whiny, though I feel like a lot of people have this problem. If you don't already have a bunch of friends it's so much harder to make them.

I'm a little over halfway through college, and all of my friends are from high school. The new people I've met are their new friends, and they're all in different circles now. I don't feel like I belong in any of them, and I'm usually the one asking my friends to hang out. I always feel like I'm bothering them.

Most of my social life in college has, stupidly, revolved around guys that I was sexually involved with. That's the only way I can make friends, it seems, but those aren't really friends. 

I was recently super disappointed because I thought I had made a new friend, but then he hit on me. Not wrong of him, and it's flattering, but now I feel like I have to be careful and we can't be close friends.

I had a long term boyfriend for a couple years, then fell into a close fwb type situation shortly after. Now that both are over, I want to be single and make some close friends or at least have some fun with the time I have left in school but I don't know how. I struggle to make plans for the weekends. 

I'm involved in my community and have tons of acquaintances, though it's a somewhat professional setting so I don't really feel comfortable breaking  the acquaintance boundary. 

**tl;dr How do I make platonic friends? What do you do when you're lonely for weeks at a time?**
