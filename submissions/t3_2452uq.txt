I've had a cyst on my left side for almost a year now, and I ended up in the ER in January for complications to one in my right. 

I've been to planned parenthood, two gynos, and a second doctor, and no one has helped me. They all just pushed me out the door and said to take sitz baths.

I've been doing that for the whole damn year. It doesn't help. It hasn't helped.

Why won't anyone listen to me? Why won't any of the doctors help? I can't afford to go back. I can't afford surgery.

What do I do? What can I do? 

The right one is starting to get inflamed again and I am so, so scared.
