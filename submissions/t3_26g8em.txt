This is my first time posting, though I've been lurking here for a while. I just really need some support. My boyfriend of one year just broke up with me. We're living together and I currently have no car. I'm getting ready to buy one but I was also laid off from my job recently so I am living off student loans until I can get everything together. I made him my whole life, spent less and less time with my friends. I'm not speaking to my family because they were abusive and I had to go NC. 

We had a great life together, we were so good together. I just couldn't give him everything he needed. I don't want this break up. We wanted a life together. We wanted to get married. 

I don't know how to deal with this. I need to find a car and a place to live. I need to make friends and be alone for a while. I don't know how to be alone. I'm so scared and I don't know how to get through this. I don't know how to go a second without thinking of him. I don't know what to do next.
