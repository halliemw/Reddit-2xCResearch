So my boyfriend and I are in a serious relationship, he was in a bad previous relationship, on and off for 5 years with lots of cheating on her part, because of it he told me that he doesn't get really emotional or romantic. So for a while he'd rarely compliment me and playfully insult me, and would make jokes to avoid emotional confrontation both good an bad.   In the past I talked about how I enjoy romance and compliments but nothing changed. But recently since he's started work and school we barely see each other, so now that we've had free time together he's suddenly become really sweet and cuddly like when we first started seeing each other, I'm beyond glad that he's finally opening up emotionally to me and showing his feelings more through words. It gives me hope that one day I can make him comfortable enough one day to fully love again. Just wanted to share ^w^
