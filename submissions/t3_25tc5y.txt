TwoX, I need you.

I've been dealing with this for a month now. From the hospital to the questioning, I have grand jury on Monday. I have felt weak and lost the entire time.


He has been in jail since. His bail was set at $25,000 and he requested to have it lowered. I waited for that call all day and I finally got it, he was denied. It felt like a small win and gave me hope. Maybe he'd plead guilty and I can start working on feeling like myself again. Feeling okay again.

But I got a call today. He's out. His family posted bail. That means his family believes in him so much that they are willing to put in a quarter of a million dollars on it.

We are apart of the same family. If he can convince them what's to say he won't convince the court. I'm scared and I'm anxious and I don't know what to do anymore. Now I feel this will never end. 

I feel so lost.
