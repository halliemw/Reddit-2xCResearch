I just feel like venting. My boyfriend's birthday was in February. I was busy all week with exams and papers so I couldn't get him anything on time. The day after his birthday, I felt really bad so I booked it to the mall and picked up his birthday present and gave it to him ASAP. My birthday was in March. He came over to my place and I made dinner. He didn't get me anything - not even a card. No big deal - I thought he was probably busy with school work. But, after my birthday, he wasn't busy at all. For a couple of weeks, he was either sleeping, gaming or eating. I talked to him and let him know how hurt I was that he didn't get me anything for my birthday and it seemed like he wasn't making any effort to get me one. He told me that he didn't know what to get me and wanted to get me something that I would really love. OK. Fine.

April was our anniversary. We went out, split the bills. I gave him his anniversary gift.

Now I'm sitting here. Still no birthday present, no anniversary present. Not even a single card for those events.

I don't want to bring this up with him again. But if he's going to be doing this every year for the rest of our lives, I don't think I want to be with him.
