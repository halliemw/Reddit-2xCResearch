Alrighty,so I've recently began considering working at a strip club. I'm a college student,living on my own,not making tons of money,and I'm just kicking around the idea.
What are your thoughts on strip clubs and stripping in general? I've always considered it to be bad idea at best,and degrading at worst. But I'm just wondering,what are your thoughts on strips clubs?
