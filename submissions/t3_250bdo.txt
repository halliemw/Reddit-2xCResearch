Sorry if this is in the wrong sub, but I'm hoping someone can offer some insight.

Basically, I am confused about why my stomach protrudes most of the time. 

I am 5'7" and 128 pounds, which is on the lower end of the BMI scale.  I  have always been naturally skinny, but I do work out for fun.  I'm 26.  Sometime in the past few years I've noticed that my tummy is always kinda bulging out.  It isn't fat (well it is a little bit), but I'm not really sure what is happening.  I guess it's bloating?

About 2 years ago I didn't eat much for a couple days (mental health issue, all good now) and my stomach was totally flat.  Does that imply that the issue is with what I'm eating?  Or do I just need to strengthen my ab muscles? 

I feel a bit embarrassed that at 26 I still have no idea what is happening with my body and it isn't something that warrants a visit to my doctor (I don't think).

Can anyone offer any advice?  Should I see a nutritionist maybe?  Or a personal trainer?
