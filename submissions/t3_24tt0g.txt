I am completely, totally in love (...lust?) with someone with whom there is zero possibility of anything happening. I work with this guy and cutting contact is not an option. He doesn't know how I feel, and neither does anybody else.

I just want to be able to spend one night where I'm not lying awake for hours thinking about him. I've tried everything, from avoiding him to distracting myself to trying to list his negative qualities. I'm desperate, I need help! :(
