Hi, as the title says, I need help coming up with fact-based logical arguments to support my viewpoint that this is a fear-based argument that limits what women are allowed to do. Links to studies and articles would be great. Unfortunately I'm just getting onto a night shift right now, so my thinking is a bit fuzzy, and I could use some help. Thanks!
