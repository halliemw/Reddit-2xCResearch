General info and brief history: I'm 30f and have always had really bad menstruation. It always seemed like a shorter cycle than most (23 or so days between periods) but still in the "normal" range. I only wear pads (because of bad cramping, and I can-no matter what- always feel tampons). I've tried BC in my early 20's...can't remember the experience being any better or worse. I have been exposed to HPV, but never had anything worse than an abnormal pap.

Now: Every few months I get a *really* bad period. Sever pain before, during, *and after* my period. There are times I can literally feel waves of cramping moving from one side of my abdomen/lower back,upper thigh to another one of those areas for hours. There have been days I had to leave work from back pain. I've gotten check ups, exams, ultrasounds etc. Every time I try to explain my concern/symptoms- I kinda feel like I get blown off. I have gotten no answers. 

I feel like my quality of life is compromised by my **massive** amount of discomfort surrounding my periods, and all of these issues that have become more and more bothersome and frequent. I thought it was Endo, I thought it was "normal", I thought it was cancer... Now I don't think it's any of those.

WHY AM I BEING BLOWN OFF BY DRs?!?! WTF IS GOING ON??
