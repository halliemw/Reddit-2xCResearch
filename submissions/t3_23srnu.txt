It's finals week, and my teacher sent an e-mail saying the final grades are posted on the online course site for my school.

He then says "There was 1 A+ in the course earned by pronounverbnoun. Congratulations, pronounverbnoun. Too bad EMU will only post an A on pronounverbnoun's transcript."

I love it, I'm laughing so hard! I wasn't expecting that! I just had to share that with you ladies :)
