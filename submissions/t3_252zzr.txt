Disclaimer: This is for my girlfriend.

She works at a bank and as such usually wears dressy flats/heels to work. Lately her feet/knees have been bothering her. Its her birthday soon so I was going to try and get some more ergonomic foot wear. Any suggestions? She's pretty fashion conscious so they need to look good. She often wears pencil skirts if that helps.

Thanks!

EDIT: THANKS 2X!
