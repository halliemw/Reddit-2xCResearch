So when I first heard about menstrual cups (is that even a correct term for them? Like the Diva Cup or whatever) I thought they were weird and kind of gross, and for hippies. Sorry ladies who use them :/ but the more I've thought and read about it, I mean, it's not like wearing a smelly blood diaper is any less gross. I have a long period usually with a heavy flow and I hate hate hate using pads, it just feels icky and I feel like I smell like blood. I have tried tampons before but they just feel really uncomfortable and I am paranoid about bleeding through. I bled completely through a tampon on the bus once and was humiliated. 

So i want to try a menstrual cup and see if that's any better? I am just worried I'll leak or it'll be uncomfortable like a tampon. Where do I even buy them anyway, the internet?
