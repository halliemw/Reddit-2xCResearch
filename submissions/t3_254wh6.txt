As a trans woman, I've always felt comfortable in TwoXChromosomes. I'm primarily a lurker, but I occasionally chime in. All in all, this is a community that has been actively supportive of trans folks.

(I want to take a moment to distinguish "tolerance" from "support." Tolerance is passive: I won't kick you out. I won't beat you up. I won't fire you. All in all, I won't be an asshole. Support requires action: I *will* use the correct name and pronoun. I *will* defend you. I *will* support you.)

I don't expect that support to change now that TwoXChromosomes is a default sub. But the balance of power has shifted. Take [this photo post from today](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2540mz/iff_first_bikini_ive_never_been_comfortable/). A week ago, I would have been surprised to see *any* comments questioning the poster's gender. Maybe a random troll had found the post, but they'd be in a tiny minority.  Today, there have been at least a dozen posts of that nature. To be clear, the response was overwhelmingly "OP *is* a woman. Get over it." And, shortly thereafter, the mods deleted the offensive comments.

But I'm not convinced that's good enough. By labeling itself as an inclusive, welcoming, supportive community, TXC is implicitly making claims about the tone of the discussion that will happen here. Those claims seem at odds with the amount of traffic any default sub will inevitably receive. 

[And the shifting balance of power is not just impacting trans women,](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2542pr/guess_i_wont_be_posting_on_here_for_a_while/) even if I suspect we're going to be the most viscously targeted.

I've read a number of posts from mods and community members about the positive value of increased visibility. They all make good points, and I can't really argue with wanting the safe space of TXC to be as large and inclusive as possible. I would never want to - for example - exclude people who identified as male, or disallow *any* sort of questioning or ignorance. But this sub - by its very nature - encourages posts that will be foreign to the majority of redditors, many of whom will be hostile to *any* women, let alone trans women. 

Placing this sub as default invites them in.

**EDIT AND CLARIFICATION**: I'm also an artist and educator by trade. My job is to travel across the country and talk about trans identity, and to help make sense of something that most people have never considered: Our identity and our body may not match, and that's OK. I have no problem with honest ignorance; in fact, it's how I make a living. Likewise, I don't find questions about trans identity - about how someone can have a penis *and* be a woman - inherently offensive. We're not born knowing this stuff, and even the best sex ed or biology is incredibly unlikely to discuss it. 

I choose to be an educator. I put on my educator hat, and walk into classrooms and theatres, prepared to share a part of myself with an audience. I want to be crystal clear that my problem is not with ignorance, or with people asking well-intentioned questions. Both have a time and a place, and the only way to learn how to be supportive of trans folks (or *any* minority) is a willingness to say, "I don't know." But that's not, so far as I can tell, the purpose of this sub. And it's certainly not the purpose of an IFF post, or of an entirely unrelated discussion about identity, personal experience, graduation, dating, body issues, or any of the myriad of other topics this sub has so beautifully encompassed.
