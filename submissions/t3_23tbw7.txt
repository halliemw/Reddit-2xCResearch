I had a few, but we grew in different directions. And besides work, I don't get out much. I would like girl friends to talk to.
The basics: 20 y/o female. Lives in Tennessee. Been a vegetarian for 12 years. Was homeschooled from grade 4 on. I am a middle child. Aspiring special makeup effects artist. I write blogs on Tumblr sometimes. I draw occasionally (but not too terribly well). I have 14 fish and 3 cats. I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year. I don't smoke. I don't do drugs (including pot). I don't drink. I don't party. I listen to various types of music depending on my mood. I've watched every episode of Doctor Who, starting with 9, and I plan to watch the older ones asap.
TL;DR: Seeking friends. Any takers?
