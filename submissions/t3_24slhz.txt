When I initially had it, I was fine, then about two days after I passed the really icky stuff, but now I'm just...bleeding?  It's kinda bloody-ish, doesn't smell great, and I'm kind of wondering if it's the LEEP or maybe my BC is thrown off by the procedure?  I was first week of pills when I had it done.  I haven't had a really period in years (yay, BC!) so I'm not sure WTF is going on.  I can't find the doc's number and this doesn't see to be anything major, so I thought I'd ask you ladies.

Thanks!
