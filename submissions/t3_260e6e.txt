My phone, voicemail, my GPS app, my text-to-speech stuff, anything where I call a phone menu system, or the self check at the grocery store, the voice at the ATM (I accidentally chose that option this week) and movie schedules.

I have to choose male voices if there is an option to do so, once I noticed this I tried having a male voice on my GPS and it just tells me miles and to turn left or right, there is no attempt to say the street names.

Has anyone else noticed this?
