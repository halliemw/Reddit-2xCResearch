I really hope that this doesnt in any way sound like one of those rants about how guy friends are better than girl friends because it really isnt. I value my female friendships and I wouldnt want to give them up. 

Having said that I notice that there are occasional tensions with many of my close girlfriends. Like as far as I know we didnt fall out or anything, but for a day or two she cant look me in the eye or her voice will be a bit brittle when she speaks to me or her smile doesnt reach her eyes and if we are in a group, she will go out of her way not to address me. Most of the time the tension passes and nobody ever mentions it.

 I just had an incident of this nature where I spent the day with a close friend and another group of acquaintances. The close friend went out of her to avoid me to the extent that she chose to take a different train back. I wondered if I was imagining it, so I wrote down the days events and even setting aside my feelings, her behavior was really off today. I **know** in a few days, all will be well again. I guess I just want to understand why this happens. I havent had very much of the same with my male friends (again, in **no way** suggesting that those friendships are superior. They have their own challenges just not this particular one). 

Does anyone else know what I am talking about? Why does this happen? Would you ever just discuss it openly with the person in question or is there an unwritten rule that we pretend that all is well?
