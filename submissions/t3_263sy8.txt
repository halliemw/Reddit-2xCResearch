Hello! Since y'all are a default subreddit now, I figured I'd use one of my throwaways to get your opinion on something I've been having trouble with. If anyone's up late and looking to humor an internet stranger, I'd appreciate it. Ready? Here we go:

First, let's assume I make it very clear to any sexual partner that I am not interested in a romantic relationship. Like... literally saying that to anyone I am sleeping with. Multiple times.

With that said: If a sexual partner fails to inform me of their growing feelings for me, and continues our casual-sex relationship in the hopes that I'll somehow change my mind... at what point is it my responsibility to end the relationship?

Is it the second I SUSPECT they're being untruthful about their intentions? This is obviously a difficult situation to "catch someone lying" in, and it would be incredibly arrogant to claim to "know" someone's mind better than they do. Is there some sort of sign I should be looking for, or a particular moral compass I can ascribe to in this situation?

I don't like hurting people, and this problem has occurred a number of times. And while each partner has admitted they were the ones being untruthful, a recent conversation has me seriously considering a vow of celibacy.

So. Am I a pompous, deceptive ass? Or have I just had bad luck with overly-romantic sexual partners? Or is there some magical answer here I'm not seeing? Pretty much just throwing this out to the internets at this point. Lemme know what'cha think.
