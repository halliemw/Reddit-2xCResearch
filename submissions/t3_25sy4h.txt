The recent post of a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFdWcNJ17YY&feature=youtu.be) from Louie got me thinking. I've also been reading the [Feminine Mystique](http://www.amazon.com/Feminine-Mystique-50th-Anniversary/dp/0393346781/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400348331&sr=1-1&keywords=feminine+mystique) recently. (You should all read it. If nothing else it might give you some insight into how your grandparents grew up and lived) And I've been thinking.



If you're not familiar with the "Feminine Mystique" (summary [here](http://www.enotes.com/topics/feminine-mystique)) it's the concept, laid out in the book of the same title, that women are defined only by their roles as wife and mother, and never have an individual identity as a person. Among other things, the book runs through the history of how the women's rights moment somehow lead to the housewifery and (often voluntary) sexism of the 50's and 60's. Within chapter 5 and 6(ish), Freidan talks about how popular media of the time including psychologists, sociologist, marriage counselors, and magazines laid out that a woman's highest achievement was child-rearing and her highest quality was her passive and genteel femininity.



It got me thinking about beauty, and how we view female beauty today. And I'm not talking about the trashy magazines that say "Bikini-ready in 10 days" and "Stars' beach bodies, page 6", though those are by all rights a horrible message to be spread so pervasively. But what about things like Dove's campaign for real bodies and blogs on the internet that espouse "fat can be beautiful too." I see these sorts of attitudes and campaigns emerging and it's lovely that there's a movement to expanding our societal concept of women's beauty.



But perhaps we're missing the point, at least a point. The feminine mystique and all the views of its era says: "All a woman can ever do or want to do is be charming and beautiful". Today that's not the case. We encourage women to be astronauts and engineers. But it seems we also encourage them to be beautiful. Campaigns and commercials like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaOjMXyJGk) seem to tell women that you must see yourself as beautiful. Like beauty has transformed not from the only thing a woman can have, but it still lies in the must category. Why does women's beauty seem to be equated with value? Even in their own minds. A commercial like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGDMXvdwN5c) wouldn
t be effective or moving if beauty was just something like "good at math."



Maybe we still have some problems to fix. Yes, there's more to beauty than the photoshopped girls on cheap magazines, but why do we as woman need to maintain this complex that we must be beautiful? Why does it hold so much power over us? Why do we need to go on campaigns telling ourselves that even the fat, the flawed, the disabled are beautiful and see scenes of women breaking down and crying at their changed conception of themselves? Why should physical appearance still have a strangehold on our sense of self-worth and societal value? It just seems to me that maybe we're campaigning a little too parallel to the feminine mystique of the past. What do you guys think?

Edit: Awesome comment from /u/animousity692 to remember:
> be mindful of how conceptions of beauty and social roles are not uniform across women, so that more people can feel as if these conversations are applicable to them.
