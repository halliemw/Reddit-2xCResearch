There's been so many posts about catcalling lately and I'm finding myself thinking where the hell do y'all live? Catcalling is something pretty foreign to me. It's never happened to me and none of my friends have talked about it happening to them. I'm not sure if it's because we don't live in a metro area, or because we're in Canada? I'm not particularly attractive, but I have friends who are, so that crosses out the 'no one thinks you're hot' angle.

I'm just looking into general terms - 'large city in SoCal', 'college town in the Northwest US', etc. I know we're valuing our privacy more than ever with the default status.
