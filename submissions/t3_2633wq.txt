I have a great friend, who happens to be male. We met 12 years ago, and since then we've been the best of friends. There was one, awkward night about 4 years ago when he tried to kiss me. I wasn't having any of it. We talked about it, he agreed that it would have been a terrible idea to become romantically involved, and now we laugh about it. 
He has a steady, serious relationship now. They moved to Australia for a year, about 2 and a half years ago. Before they left, he and I were still really close. He would come over all the time, with or without her and just hang with me. Hanging out at my place watching tv, having a drink (or more) became a habit when I was a stay-at-home single mom. (I'm Canadian - 12 month mat leave, and have really supportive parents.) But since they got back, I feel like a lot of distance has grown in place of our close friendship. He doesn't come over as often, and has recently been canceling plans. 
His gf has anxiety and depression issues, and often leaves group events because of overwhelming social anxiety. The last time he had to cancel it was because she was "freaking out" and wouldn't let him "have fun without her", his words.
I was complaining about this with my mom, and instead of the support I was looking for, she told me I was wrong for pursuing a friendship with him. According to her, when in a relationship, friendships with the opposite sex are unacceptable.
I shut that conversation down, because there was no way we will ever see eye to eye.
Now, if he was choosing to put his gf and her insecurities above our 12 year friendship, and explained that to me, I'd understand. I'd be hurt, but I'd get it. But am I wrong for wanting to be his friend? Can men and women ever be just friends?

tl;dr: My mom thinks I can't be friends with a guy because he has a girlfriend now.
