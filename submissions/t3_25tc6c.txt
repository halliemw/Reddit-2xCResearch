Backstory: I was sexually assaulted by my boyfriend back in October. I reported him to our University in January (our court date is the 29th of this month).  But after I reported him, I find out he assaulted another girl and I freaked out. I felt so guilty for not saying anything sooner and getting him kicked out of our dorm. I had a mental breakdown and was in the ER a few days later for having panic attacks and suicidal intent.  When I found out though, I went down to his quad and yelled at him mainly saying 'Unless a girl says something, SHE DOES NOT WANT IT."

I found out yesterday from the prehearing that he intends to press charges against me for harassment.  I'm at a complete loss. I have no idea what's going to happen. I don't want him to get away with this with not even a slap on the wrist.  I don't want to get in trouble because HE decided to sexually assault 2 girls. I just have no idea what to do.
