Hello, everyone!

Ive come to ask my sisters an odd question. Do you ever get odd burst of emotions? 

Ive been diagnosed with severe depression so I dont know if this is just from being a female or the depression.

What it feels like is a sneeze of emotions, I feel a tingly and then a wave of every emotion my brain can manifest. It ranges from a manic happy to "the pint of ice cream" sobs to some kind of "saw something gross" reaction.

A literal mood swing/sneeze because ill go through all these emotions in a matter of 10 to 20 mins?

What the heck is it? Does anyone else here experience these?
