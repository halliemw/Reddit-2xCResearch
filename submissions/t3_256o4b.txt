I've been having a tough time with hormonal BC. I've been taking it for about a year and a half, but I've only started to experience adverse side effects in the last 6 months or so. I've had bouts of depression, mood swings, and a crushingly nonexistent libido. Since these effects have persisted consistently, I decided I should try to switch to a non-hormonal method of birth control. I should mention that I am 21 years old, in a long-term relationship, and have never been pregnant. 

I made an appointment to talk with my doctor, and right off the bat I could tell that she was not going to budge her opinion. Before she walked in the door, her mind was made up. She was not going to give me an IUD, and certainly not a non-hormonal one. She said that because I have never been pregnant, I would be at a much greater risk of infection with an IUD, and that my uterus would be too small. No examination, nothing. She said my best bet for better emotional health would be changing up my hormonal BC cocktail. She said that basically no matter what, birth control will always affect my mood, and keep my libido low. She gave me a new pill pack, and sent me on my way. 

If these side effects were minor, I wouldn't have even gone in to see her. The thing is that I no longer feel like myself. I can feel horribly empty and very *wrong* to a point where it's difficult to function. 

My SO is going away for the summer, so I thought I'd go off the pill for a couple months and see how it goes. But after that, I'm not sure what to do. Do I get a second opinion? How do I find a good doctor? Should I just try the new pill pack?

Have any of you ever had this type of experience with BC? How do you handle it?
