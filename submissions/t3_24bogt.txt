**TL:DR** there are no recorded accounts of a child luring a woman to be raped.

I saw a tumblr post today that said :

"ATTENTION ALL GIRLS AND LADIES: if you walk from home, school, office or anywhere and you are alone and you come across a little boy crying holding a piece of paper with an address on it, DO NOT TAKE HIM THERE! take him straight to the police station for this is the new ‘gang’ way of rape. The incident is getting worse. Warn your families. Reblog this so this message can get accross to everyone. 
I will always reblog things like this, it won’t ruin your blog or the look of it, and this could potentially save a life"

It had 62,243 notes this really irritated me.

I am not saying this may have never happened, I couldn't find any accounts of this happening in the US.

I grew up with my mother telling me lies about the world just so I would be afraid of everything. She would tell me a gang member would jump our 8 foot brick wall and rape me in our backyard. So I was never able to play outside, ever. Any many more things like that. 

If you find a lost child, call the police, it is that simple. Don't make up stories or spread made up stories to spread more lies and strike fear in people.

Dangers are real, rape is real, please be careful and safe, but stories like these aren't helping anyone.

Sorry if this wasn't this place, I just felt it had to be said. 
Thanks for reading.
