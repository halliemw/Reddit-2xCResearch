So here's the rundown. I'm checking out at the local organic ripoff super-haven wearing my sweats/sweatshirt combo and greased up hair in a bun. The cashier was straight out of a Hugo Boss ad and stupid me couldn't even make eye contact when the super model cashier was making light conversation. He kept asking me about my plans tonight and stuff and dear-god I think he was flirting. Like giggling school-girl shit going down on his half of the register. Anyway I continue to avoid contact and run out with my groceries beating myself to death for not being that sexy chick who isn't scared of rejection. 

So I just wanna know, any of you double X's just straight up asked for some random guy's number? How did it go? And what would I have even said? 

In case you can't tell I tend to freeze up when I'm talking to a fucking demi-god.
