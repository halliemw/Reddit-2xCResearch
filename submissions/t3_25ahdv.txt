I am a freelancer with a strong background, but always have confidence issues when applying for jobs. I have heard stats that women are more likely to apply for a job only if they meet every qualification, whereas men will just assume they can do the job without all the qualifications. Or that women are less likely to negotiate salary, etc.


I worked with this guy "Brad" on a project as a peer. Two years later, I was a Co-Producer on a show and needed to hire an Associate Producer for just a month. Frankly, he was terrible and I was blamed for his sloppy work. I felt weird reprimanding him (which is a whole other issue). I had hired him because after we originally worked together he was hired onto a great show, making insane money.


A few months later, I ask for his resume to forward on to something he would be good at. I was so shocked to see
how he described his work on my show. He took credit for way more than he did! And he used such strong language to describe his roles. Where I would have said "assisted the production team", he wrote "produced". I felt like a fool for years of not writing strong language in my resume where less deserving people like Brad were out there getting calls for great jobs because...I mean even though I was his boss and worked on this for two years, the way he wrote his resume, he was the clear better hire.


I cant blame him because hes just doing his best to get work but damn if that isnt frustrating.


TL;DR - Male subordinate sells himself way better on his resume than I do! 


Is this just me ladies, or do you struggle with job appplication confidence?
