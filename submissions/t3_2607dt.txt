This is my first time posting. And I tend to ramble so my apologies in advance.

After much thought and research. I finally took the plunge and had Mirena inserted Saturday. Just as I've seen on other posts here the insertion was uncomfortable and as painful as the worst period cramps. I spent most of Saturday experiencing severe cramps and therefore laid around most of the day.

My OBGYN said that I would experience cramping for a day or day and a half after insertion but not longer than that. I'm three days out now and I'm still cramping a lot.

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced cramping that have lasted longer than what their doc said? 

What does it feel like when the IUD has migrated? 

And what does perforation feel like? Or how do you know if something's not right?

I know this all might sound paranoid, but I'm a bit of a worry wart and I don't have many people in my life who would support me, my mom is really old school in regards to sexual health and my sister belittles any concerns I may have. I do have a loving boyfriend of 3 yrs. but what I really need right now is some support from other women who know about this.

Again I'm sorry for the rambling and I just want to thank all of you in advance.
