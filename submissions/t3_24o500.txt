A guy that is a part of my friend group is an asshole and is constantly making sexist jokes about me when we're around. For example, when my fiancé mentions cooking, cleaning, etc, this guy will say something like, "Isn's that what you're dating [My Name] for?" Insinuating that the only reason my fiancé is with me is for a live in maid. He does this all the time and it boils my blood. When I call him out on it he justs ups the ante and plays it off like he's just goofing around and I'm a bitch for being bothered by it. When I told him to knock it off he said, "Who said that? Oh, shouldn't you be in the kitchen?" Am I overreacting? How do I get him to leave me alone?
