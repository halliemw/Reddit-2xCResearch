On saturday night I hooked up with a friend of a friend. We didn't have penetrative sex but he did finger me shortly after he came and I suspect there may have been sperm on his hand. I don't know for sure. I've been doing a lot of research online and I've found instances on pregnancy forums of women who got pregnant this way. However, they are few and far between. 

Last night and all day today I  have been feeling weirdly nauseated and achy, with lower back pain. It's not my time of the month, and I missed my last period because my cycle is just weird like that; so I have no idea when my next one is supposed to come anyway. I know symptoms aren't supposed to be prevalent after just a few days, but again I have read of instances where women did have very early pregnancy symptoms and were in fact pregnant.

I don't know if I'm pregnant or not. I know it's unlikely but I just feel weird inside and I'm probably being paranoid but I really, really needed to tell someone. Pregnancy tests won't show anything for at least a few weeks and my uncertainty is killing me. 

**Tl:Dr; There's a slight chance I'm pregnant and I'm really freaking out.**

**edit: Thanks for all the support! I'm going to try to calm down now, the stress is probably what's making me feel weird.**
