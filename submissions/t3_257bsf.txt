Let me start this out by saying I'm in high school.

I hate saying this story is a "not me, it's for a friend!" story but it is. Background: friend's younger and was scared of the judgement of buying plan b, so I offered to go with her or if she wants, I can just get it myself because it won't bother me at all. She asks if I can buy it myself and I obliged because I'm just buying some medicine, what's the worst that can happen?

I honestly didn't even think about people judging me because *I* knew it wasn't for me but when I couldn't find it and I had to ask a male worker, I saw the look of judgement on his face and realized exactly why my friend was reluctant to buy it.

I was getting dirty looks and second glances from kids my own age, middle aged adults, and old folks alike. I was mortified, which is ridiculous.

Why is bad that, for their perspective, a 17 year old girl doesn't want to have a child? Why should it be embarrassing that I'm trying to prevent a teenage pregnancy? Why is there a much bigger stigma around buying plan b as a girl than buying condoms as a guy? 

Maybe I'm just overthinking this but it was almost like a psychology experiment. What was their thought process? *that girl is so irresponsible for having sex in high school, she shouldn't be buying plan b, she should just have that child because she's so irresponsible!*

in the end, I don't regret buying it all. It was embarrassing at the time, but as soon as I walked out that door I remembered no one in that store matters at all. None of them know who I am. None of them know why I was buying it. Even if I was buying it for myself, none of them knew what led up to it. 

**TL;DR suddenly became demon in middle of pharmacy for trying to prevent teenage pregnancy but don't care because teenage pregnancy isn't something I'm planning in my future**


also sorry for the throwaway, kinda scared that this is a default sub now.


EDIT: thank you everyone for your kind words and advice
