Hi ladies! I just wanted to post in celebration of my impending graduation with a BA! I'll be throwing myself headfirst into school again in August to start a teaching credential program in hopes of teaching elementary school so it doesn't really feel like the big deal that a lot of other people seem to have when finishing college but I'm really excited!! It has been 5 years in the making and to top it off, I'm  the president of my department's student organization so I'm in charge of the graduation ceremony for my major! I'm pretty sure my blood pressure is through the roof this month but come May 23rd I'll be in a cap and gown in a BEAUTIFUL space in a ceremony with about 800 people! And I made it happen, holy crap!

I just wanted to gush a bit here because a lot of my friends are also graduating and moving away so they're all stressed out and distracted and my boyfriend was supposed to be graduating this semester but will probably have to take a class over the summer to finish up and I don't want to hurt his feelings by getting all giddy in front of him. So cheers my internet friends!
