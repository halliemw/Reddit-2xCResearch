Some people were upset with him and called him out but some people joked along and talked about bringing a fake gun to campus dipped in red blood.

The post got deleted after 2 hours but now I am freaked out. I know inside it's just 18year old boys being idiots but I still feel frightened to go to class tomorrow. 

It's also starting to trigger my previous anxiety I have from growing up with an abusive father. He actually held our family hostage over night when I was 13 with a sawn off shot gun. I know I shouldn't let it bother me but I'm starting to freak the fuck out.

I've reported it to my university security. I don't care if it was a joke. It's a freaking terrible one.
