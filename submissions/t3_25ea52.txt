Hi TwoX's.

I am writing to say I for one am super happy you have become a default sub.  Although I have an account, I often don't sign in because I often like to see what's happening in the main stream of reddit.  [Today upon opening up the front page I found this TwoX story about abortion](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25dh62/tomorrow_i_am_driving_my_ultraconservative_anti/).  And it reminded me of how hard it is to be in this world for women.  So I clicked on the TwoX link and started reading some of the other stories here.  I laughed and felt grossed out by [dog and the tampon story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25c3eq/oh_god_my_dog_ate_my_tampon_and_then_shat_it_out/). Read with horror about the couple of domestic violence stories and many of the other stories in here.  

My point is that the more that we XY people hear from you about your lives and what you go through on a day to day basis, the more women's stories become human stories.  And I know that there will be a spike in troll activity, this will soon die down.  And reddit will be on it's way to becoming even more of the humanist site it is, where many different groups of people can have a strong representative voice.  

Anyway I look forward to reading your stories into the future and welcome to the default list.
