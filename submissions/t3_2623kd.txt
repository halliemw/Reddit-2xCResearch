So, this summer I'm doing an internship with a big mining company, since I am getting my master's in mining engineering. 

I am literally the only woman here...I mean, I'm sure there are others out there. Somewhere. But I've not seen any of them. It's just me and a bunch of dudes, which I thought I'd be ok with but honestly? It's a little rough. I keep feeling like they don't want me here, or that I don't belong and wound up here by mistake. I feel invisible, like I have to go up and force others to interact with me. It's a sort of cold apathy I keep encountering...or maybe it's in my head. I think it must be in my head, as a mild form of imposter syndrome, because there's no way an entire group of people would not want me based on a single fact... I'm just hoping I have a great summer experience despite it.

That's all, really. Just felt the need to rant.
