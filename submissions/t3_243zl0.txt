So since I've started regularly having monogamous sex with my fianc√© without condoms (on birth control pills), I've been getting UTIs or at least the symptoms.

You know: feeling icky (lower abdomen sore), burns a bit on the skin around while peeing, redness and irritation, etc.

I've made some changes!

I IMMEDIATELY sprint to the restroom to pee and wipe down. We alternate using/not using condoms or just oral instead of vaginal. I've switched soaps to Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented soap to use down there, baby wipes instead of feminine wipes, no douching EVER, no Summer's Eve shit. I take cranberry supplements, drink cranberry juice and eat yogurt everyday, and I wear cotton underwear. No more tampons either. I've been using the Monistat/Vagisil/female Hydrocortisone itch cream if it gets irritated and also I use a pH Monistat balance insert and so far so good. I know it's all about the balance in vaginal bacteria - I just needed some good remedies to fix it before it got worse.


So far - nothing bothering me! I feel confident and sexy! I wanted to ask how you all deal with after-sex care and also share what I've learned.
