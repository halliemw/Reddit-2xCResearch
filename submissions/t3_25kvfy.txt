Some of the topics that I've enjoyed the most in spite of the recent chaos are those in which a lot of us get together and talk about characters we like in stories, books we like, and so on and so forth. To this end, I was wondering if anyone else might be interested in trying out a book club.

I have two possible ideas for how this could work:
(1) People could recommend 1 book per reply they make, and maybe give a sentence or two telling us what it is or why they like it. People upvote books they think they would want to read and discuss. And then the person with the most upvoted post makes a thread in which we discuss the book for the next month or so, depending on reading speeds, size of the book, etc.
(2) We could just start making more posts talking about our experience with women in books we read, author recommendations, etc.

I don't know how well a formal-ish book club would work with a large (and rapidly growing) community, but I wanted to gauge interest nonetheless.

For what it's worth, I would be very interested in hearing it if anyone had recommendations for where to start in reading Octavia Butler or George Eliot.

Edit: I went ahead and made it! There is still much to be done before it's a real sub, but check it out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXBookClub/)!
