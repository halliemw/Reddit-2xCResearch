It's been a year since I kicked my ex out of the house. He admitted to me, after 7 years together, that he hadn't been in love with me in 5 years. During that time, I had worked as the breadwinner and supported the two of us. He left when he finally got a job that paid more than me (working for my cousin).

Since I hit the one year of kicking him out, I got into a stupid frame of mind and unblocked him on Facebook. This lead me to learn that several of my close friends have stayed friends with him and still talk to him. I got upset and posted to a select group of people that I wasn't comfortable being friends with someone who treated me so poorly. 

In a turn that has torn out my heart, none of my close friends from high school (14 years ago) and on have agreed with thus statement. None of the people who have stayed friends with him have reached out in any way. 

Except one, who said I was twisting the past and putting negativity into the world. That thus was a terrible thing to do and that I never should have expected him to be honest or treat me well if I was sleeping with other people. Never mind that he knew about it, and also had sex with other people. 

She also said that I was throwing around serious accusations and that he has been nothing but nice since the divorce. 

I feel so alone. I have a new partner who is very loving, but I still haven't healed from my past. I question his honesty in his love for me, and I worry that he's only with me so I'll take care of him. And it just breaks me up to think that people who have been so important in my life wouldn't believe me that he was abusive towards me.
