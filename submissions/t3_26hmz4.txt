Hi, guys. I need some advice. I've been working on a project for about two years, and a friend and I are on a team processing data for said project. She started before I did, but we were trained for the processing job at the same time. Here's the thing: I've been doing it as a volunteer position for my entire time there, whereas she has been getting paid since last year. I've been ignoring it since last year, but I just recently realized I've done more work than her, especially because right now I have a huge folder to work on whereas she has nothing. It's really rubbing me the wrong way that I have to work on this outside of the time I am scheduled, without any sort of compensation.
She's worked with more folders because they contain less files, whereas every one I'm assigned has around 100+. I just don't think it's fair, but I'm not sure how to broach the topic, because not only did my friend not tell me about being paid, but I only found out because the file was in the downloads folder on the computer and I was curious when I went in to clean it. 
Like right now, I have work for class due tomorrow that I am putting off to finish this data set, and I just don't think it's right that she gets paid for all the times she is there, while I essentially do more work and get nothing.
Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. Should I bring this up with the supervisor or just ignore it? I plan on leaving soon anyway because I don't think I'm going to be getting anything more out of this project and I'm tired of spending 10+ hours every week for something that essentially just gives me nothing.
