People (in the US this morning) are fairly upset about Emma Thompson's quote on [working moms](http://pagesix.com/2014/05/25/working-women-cant-be-great-moms-emma-thompson/). 

Let's all remember, the job of the news is to make headlines that are explosive. For Emma Thompson, time off as a parent is a [societal norm.](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/leave)  For Americans and others, it is fantasy. What we should be TRULY outraged about is that it is not more of a societal norm; that parents of all sorts, birth parents, foster parents, adoptive parents, do not get much more support, and that Emma is somewhat right - it is hard to be a working parent! We need to recognize that very fact, how hard it us to work and parent and be away from the very people that you are working so hard to support.  

Yes, Emma Thompson makes much more than any of us, I'll wager...it IS hard to be a great parent, working or not, but her reported 50 million net worth* (corrected by /u/plentyofrabbits) can't hurt.  But I do not believe that she is saying that working parents are in some way less than a parent who has the ability to be away from work. 

I'd love for everyone to share their thoughts.
