I'm supposed to be starting at the company he works at next week after a process that was started by him. 

On lunch today I learn that I was going to be switched into his office. He was asked by his boss if that was ok, and now I am apparently going to be in an office by myself. While everyone else has at least three different people in their office.

I feel-- broken. Obviously he said it wasn't ok, or I wouldn't be singled out from everyone else, and stuck in a room by myself. HE started this. I never asked for this.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I should back out of the job if there are going to be issues like this. I don't want to be this kind of couple.

Obviously I'm talking to him tonight about it, but I just-- I don't know. My brain feels like it's vibrating. 

I kind of just needed to rant.
