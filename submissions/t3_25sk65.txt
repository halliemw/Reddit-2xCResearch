This post is mostly directed at those ladies who are in serious long-term or live-in romantic situations. 
I have been part of a serious relationship (not without it's ups and downs) for going on two years now. Throughout these two years both me and my partner have changed and grown by each other's side to become very people different than we were when we met. 
Before this relationship I had been single for a long time, enjoyed my alone time and felt confident in being alone. People often say you don't know what true anger or sadness is until it's manifested by lovers and I now believe that to be true. 
It started with confusion and blame. "How can we be meant for each other if he can make me more angry than anyone I've ever met" and the like.
Eventually I learned to reason with my emotions and take what came as an "in the passions of love" type of thing. I dabble here and there in anxiety as it has it's ups and downs depending on the state of the rest of my life, and I've found it recently to be crippling - devouring my mental state day in and day out until sometimes I literally feel like a shell. This tosses the passions of love into a storm and enhances any lovers quarreling that may already be taking place. Sometimes I feel as though I've lost my self-worth from clinging so hard to my significant other for support.
I am searching for similar situations and any helpful exercises or practices that help with self-confidence with OR without a constant partner. 
Thanks for listening
