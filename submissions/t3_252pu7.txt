Hear me out; I've been subbed top TwoX since I first joined Reddit two years ago and I appreciate having a community of supportive and knowledgeable women that are willing to share. You ladies provide me with so much good information that I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else- information that helps me be more comfortable in my own skin, information that helps me stay healthy and safe, information that eases my mind of almost all the fears that stem from being a teenage girl.

I've even been able to post here when I had questions about birth control and insurance (something that honestly caused me to have a breakdown because I didn't know what to do). You ladies actually helped me through a difficult turning point in my life! I don't know what I would have done without you all.

Now I know that a lot of you are upset with the influx of people. No, we are not an obscure little club anymore. No, we cannot freely post here without any worry of being challenged anymore. Yes, there will be more asshats in here. But you know, that's just part if bring integrated into a new community. More people means more chaos, always. That just means we'll have to work twice as hard to make it the place it needs to be. Downvote, report, redirect, inform.

Just because we have to put in effort does not mean we should just throw our hands up in frustration.

I say this because there will be more girls like me, either misinformed or lost. Those girls need you ladies, and now that we're a default we can help more of them and help them become more informant and confident in their knowledge.

Honestly, I find it a bit upsetting that some of you are angry that you can't just reap the benefits anymore and will have to work to keep the community supportive. It's like high school cliques all over again.

So please just do me a favor and stick around to help confused and upset girls like I was.
