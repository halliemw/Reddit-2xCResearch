I have a question, 2X, which has been bothering me for a while.  I identify as a feminist, but as a feminist I also campaign for men's rights.  Gender inequality does not, I believe, affect just the glass ceiling but also the cutthroat, man-up attitude of career driven persons.  I think it has to do with women being perceived as sluts and men being perceived as predators; of women being seen as weaker in all aspects and men being seen as stronger in all aspects, least you be not womanly enough or not manly enough.  However, I've recently come against some contrary opinions, and I'm thinking perhaps feminism is not necessarily the platform that is supportive of both sexes.

My question, 2X users, is: do you feel that feminism and men's rights are compatible?  By empowering men to break from their own gendered stereotypes are we opening the door to more opportunities for ourselves as women and future generations of women, or does this simply take the focus away from women's goals and rights? What do you think?
