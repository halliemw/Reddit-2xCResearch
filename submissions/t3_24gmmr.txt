Ok, I know there are more appropriate places to put this, but you all are my people. (throwaway because my work peeps are here)

Anywho.

I need to quit my min wage job that I've been at for only a few months to take one that will use my degree.

I'm really bad at talking to people, and I have NO idea what to say to my boss. I have the letter down, and ready to hand to him, but other than that I'm clueless.

I'm thinking:
Hi (Boss) I received notification from a scout that they would like to hire me as of May 12. My last day is going to be May 9. (and that is it)
How does that sound?


Also. 
He is never there when I am (I work evenings) so it's going to be hard to catch him. Would it be ok to leave my formal letter with a written one explaining that I would have met with him, but I wanted him to have notice ASAP since it's already short notice?


TLDR; I need to quit my minimum wage job I started a few months ago, but I don't know what words to say.
