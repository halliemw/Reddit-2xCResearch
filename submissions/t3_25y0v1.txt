Not sure if this is where I should post this, but I created a throwaway for it, so here goes:

My last two period have been TINY. Normally, I'd have one for about 4-6 days, with the first two being a competition to see how many pads I can go through in one day, and the next couple of days everything calming down. The color changes are like a regular period: bright to dark. 

However, my last period was more of spotting over a span of 3 days. The first day was still the brightest and the 3rd was the darkest, but there wasn't really anything there. I barely needed a pad. 
I thought: "Alright, no problem, we'll see how it is in a month."

Same story. Maybe an ounce more of everything, but I'm basically having the same thing:

Bright, but small, first day, and now (the second day), it's a bit darker, but still. More of spotting than a period.
I don't know whether it's a hormonal thing, a pregnancy thing, a nutritional thing, or what. I want to rule out pregnancy, because I've only just lost my virginity a month-and-a-half ago, and since then, had sex maybe 3 or 4 times, where he came. But there was always a condom and it always got tied up and thrown away at the end.

Is it normal to sometimes not have much of a period? 

Edit: NOT PREGNANT, JUST TOOK THE TEST, it felt extremely surreal and I now know a bit about the abortion laws here where I live (call it late-night cramming). Anyway, I'm even more relieved to not have to tell the guy about any of this. 

I guess this is because of stress, then...
