Hello all! I have been doing some research but I have not found any answers to my question. I will ask it here and I am sorry in advance if someone already asked and I just couldn't find it. 

I just started taking Microgynon, it is a 0.15 mg Levonorgestrel/0.03 mg Etinilestradiol split. I have never been on this particular BC before, but I have been on others. I have never had acne in my life, just pimples/zits from time to time. Since I went on this pill I have broken out all over my face, even on places I never had zits before, like on my nose and around my eyes. My skin is also crazy uneven, my foundation doesn't cover well, as if my skin is a different color. I am concerned. 

I read online that Seasonale (the same chemical split) causes your acne to get worse for the first month sometimes and when people have waited until the next month it cleared up and their skin even got better. 

So, this is my question, has anyone ever been on this medication? If they have, has anyone had the same experience as I have? Even if you haven't, does anyone have an idea if I should tough it out and wait another month before switching, or switch right away?

Please, please help! Maybe I am also a little more emotional than usual because this is making me cry right now ;) 

Thanks in advance everyone.
