Hi guys. I've been a long time browser of TwoX, and finally decided it's time to post. 

I'm 18, and live about 500 miles from home due to college, This Memorial Day weekend, I'd had to travel back to my hometown to participate in a trial. The trial to try and find my rapist guilty of raping me five years ago.

Yes, five years. Which made me 13 at the time. I don't much like talking about it, but I'll give you a small run down.

I went to a little get together with my big sister and friend. None of us were drinking any type of alcohol. But I guess I hadn't been watching my drink close enough. I started to feel extremely sick and went outside with my friend, who then ran back inside to get my sister. The last thing I remember is getting grabbed.

Fast forward five years. I get a call, and it's the court system. Apparently, it took the hospital and police 5 years to put the rape kit through, get the information, and finally tell someone (thanks guys). And they found the guy who did it. He was one of my best friends. So I fly down for the trial and he's finally found guilty.

I'll be honest, I thought seeing him would be a major trigger, but it was actually more closure. Yeah, I felt threatened and scared, but after the case was finished and he was gone, I sat down and cried. Cried in relief that he was finally gone, there was no more threat of that same man coming back, and I'm finally rid of the grief I'd been carrying for five years. 

Sitting down in my old room, I was thinking about it and I thought of you guys and thought it would be a good area to place this story.

Thanks for reading, and have a great Memorial Day weekend if you live in America, and a great weekend nonetheless if you don't.
