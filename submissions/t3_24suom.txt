i feel like she's doing exactly what i did and always do - skipping from one serious relationship to the next. dating someone with a certain flaw and then dating the total opposite flaw. overcompensating. it's like going for years eating only chocolate. it's delicious, but after a while you start craving french fries. but you don't want to immediately start eating nothing but french fries for years, right? you want pb&j or mac & cheese or SOME kind of variety! but it's easy to settle for french fries when they're in front of you. 
...and now i really want some french fries.
