Hey everyone,

Summer is approaching and with that, comes warm weather and a change of wardrobe. Where I live, it's been quite the hot week after having a cool spring, and I'm slowly getting readjusted to shorts, skirts, and tank tops. Unfortunately with the [skimpier] clothing, I've already experienced a fair share of unwanted attention and catcalling on sidewalks and intersections (doesn't help that I tend to walk everywhere and take transit). Of course, clothing, or lack thereof doesn't necessarily, directly correlate with street harassment, but it's undeniable that it definitely tends to spike in the summer. 



The perpetrators tend to usually be older, scruffier looking men (truck drivers, construction workers, etc.) who look like my dad's age, or greasy-looking womanizers, and thus I never feel comfortable or consider "flattered". It just makes me feel completely uncomfortable and kind of messes with my somewhat low self-esteem, not to mention making it difficult to pick an outfit in the morning as I become very conscious of myself and how I carry myself. 


There's been times where I've been extremely riled up and yell back at the perps, or show the finger. It can definitely be difficult ignoring at times, especially when you're a bit of a hothead like me. 

So, how do you all handle street harassment/unwanted attention?
