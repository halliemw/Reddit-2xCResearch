I have had the toughest time making girlfriends as an adult. I was bullied intensively as a child and high school,and found solace in male friends. The problem is - I'm girly, I want someone to do yoga with, to get drunk and watch a movie with [ I'm 27 ]. The problem is I'm finishing school (bfa) and don't have a career to meet people. How do you/have you met friends? Do I suffice with my own bs and find friends when it's convenient (I.e work) or find alternatives outside work??
