I had a thought last night while laying in bed and I thought I'd share it with you ladies! Everyone always says to treat others how you'd want to be treated but I never thought of it using the same saying on myself. 

You would never allow your friends or significant others to call you fat, insignificant, ugly, boring, or (insert negative adjective here). If we don't want others to treat us poorly we should NOT allow ourselves to say those things either. We've all heard that we should say positive things to ourselves etc etc. but it never hit home until I thought about how verbal abuse from others is a real thing and how I would never allow those abusive people in my life. Why then should I allow that abuse from myself?

Moral of my story: we should learn to treat ourselves how we want to be treated!

I hope you all have a beautiful Wednesday and love yourselves a little more everyday!
