This is a weird question. I'm really sorry.

Long story short, I have recently been diagnosed with something called a urethral diverticulum - two of them, in fact, making it "diverticula". I saw a surgeon today and we discussed the pros and cons of surgically fixing it, but I'm still on the fence. 

I guess I'm looking for other people's experiences with vaginal or urethral surgery. Did you find healing was difficult? How was the pain? Did you run into any problems with fistulae or incontinence? Have you fully recovered?

Thanks. I'm pretty scared and upset at this point, so any experience or knowledge would really mean a lot to me.
