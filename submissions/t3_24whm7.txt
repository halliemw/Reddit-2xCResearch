I don't know if this is the right sub for this (if anyone knows where this is supposed to be, let me know).

However,

I'm looking for a dress, but everything online is in China, and I don't feel like getting scammed. Are there any reputable dress shops online at all that don't charge an arm and a leg for a ball-gown style dress? I'm pear-shaped, so that style suits me best, but I don't want to pay over $1000 for a dress I will wear once.

Thanks. :)
