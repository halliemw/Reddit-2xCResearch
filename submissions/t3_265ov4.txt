Shortest version of the story(I've posted most of this in a comment before); Now this was the man I was head over heels in love and have a beautiful son with. I found out he had been cheating on me with his ex wife. He disappeared, so I left him. He had moved back in with her before we were no longer together.
This was the woman that had him incarcerated under false charges, ruined his credit, didn't let him see his son for 2 1/2 years, and also filed with the VA that he was fully disabled from combat so she could collect $3300 a month. 

He didn't see our son for almost 2 months. I had to track him down to confront him. Now I'm lucky if he'll see him once a week for a few hours. When he actually does show up, he'll try to pass the baby back to me every chance he has. Now he's avoiding/running from child support.

I also found out a few days ago that he's been lying about me to our mutual friends, trying to ruin our friendships. I'm lucky enough that they came to me to talk about my "gossiping" before they stopped talking to me all together.

My biggest issue is that I cannot find where he and his ex wife live. They are completely unlisted. Child support services have tried ever option. I even used a site I have to pay for trying to find them. Its been 5 months since my claim has been accepted. He refuses to give me their address. His court summons has to be physically given to him. 

If I think of more, I'll add more. Im also not sure if this is where my post should go. Sorry for formatting and any typos, I'm on mobile. 

Thank you for reading my rant.
