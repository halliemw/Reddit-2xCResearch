I've been on BC since I was about 14 years old and I have never known my body without it. I'm really curious to see how my natural hormones affect me. I'd like to hear other people's experiences of getting off hormonal BC (the good and the bad) and I would also like to know the methods people found worked for them for preventing pregnancy. Since I've been on BC before I was sexually active and I've only been with my current partner, I've never had to consider any other methods of pregnancy protection. I'm a 21 year old female in a long term relationship and STD protection isn't a concern right now. I would really like some advice to ensure I'm making a smart decision. Thanks in advance!
