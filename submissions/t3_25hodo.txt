My girlfriend has endo at a pretty young age (she was diagnosed in her teens), and lately has been having some pretty horrible pain. Apparently she had been developing some large ovarian cysts and a couple had ruptured. 

About 6 years ago, she went on birth control to treat it and had many problems with that route. She didn't like how her body changed, she didn't like that she "turned into a bitch" (her words), and she hated that she lost her sex drive. Birth control is still the best treatment according to her doctor, but she is afraid that it'll take her down the same path. 

She is also not sure that her doctor is aware of a gall bladder problem, and warnings on birth control pretty commonly advise against it under those circumstances. She's planning on calling her doctor tomorrow to address all of this. 

She is against going on birth control, and I'm trying to support her and remind her that her doctor knows what she's talking about, but I think it would come better from people who have actually experienced these issues.
