Been with my SO for four years and we're expecting a baby in September. Pretty much everyone I tell has asked "So are yall going to get married?...you're not? Why not?" as if having a baby is a good reason to get married. We have our reasons for not wanting to get married, not that it's anyone else's goddamn business. It's not like a certificate that says we're married is going to affect how we feel about each other or our commitment to each other. Do people really think I should have rushed straight to the courthouse to get married when I found out I was pregnant? I even had a relative tell me "Well you *better* get married," and my parents told my siblings they don't like my significant other because "he believes it's okay to get an unmarried girl pregnant." Our kid isn't going to be some fucked up, unethical person just because me and her dad aren't married.

The looks people give me when I tell them I'm not getting married anytime soon are infuriating.

Just needed to let out some anger.
