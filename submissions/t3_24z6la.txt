I'm not sure if I missed my period or not yet because I honestly don't track it. It usually comes around this time though, I remember having it around this time last month. Beside that I've noticed a lot of different symptoms that i don't normally have, I have been under some stress but I just don't know. 

Over the course of the month I lost a good amount of weight, but then gained back 4 pounds rather quickly. I'm never hungry, sometimes I'm in the mood for something and I'll a lot of it. It's not odd cravings but it's pretty specific stuff. Normally I don't have much of an appetite. Food just doesn't have much of a taste most of the time. I do get occasionally headaches and I do feel nauseous a good amount. I also get back pain when I end up standing for a long time and every time I wake up. I'm 19 and don't have a history is back pain so that is probably the most new thing for me. I'm not sure if I missed my period or not yet, but at this point i'm worried. I'm almost positive I should have it by now. I have been having cramps through out the month and worse cramps these past few days, but no period or spotting. I also have sensitive nipples, it's not overwhelming but it's there and that is also something new for me.
