Even if it's yourself, in the mirror, tell me about the last time someone saw how incredibly special and amazing you are

and bothered to tell you.

If you can't remember, or if your're not satisfied with it, I challenge you to look in the mirror. Keep looking--for as long as it takes--until you are that person to look at yourself and say "Damn. You are beautiful."
