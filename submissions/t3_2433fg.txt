I thought about this because tonight while getting groceries, I was helping out by bagging the items while my boyfriend did some last-minute looking around. I didn't bag so well, I guess, because the cashier commented on how awkwardly bagged the groceries were (hard items on the bottom, light and organic on top I thought..). He kept joking with my boyfriend to make me carry it, and repeatedly (in a more serious tone) said "just have her carry this one and hold it on the bottom." I found it odd that he was telling my boyfriend what instructions to give me, and realized it happens all the time. People (strangers) address my boyfriend and talk to him directly far more than they do to me. It really bothers me, though I don't know how sensitive I'm being. Does this happen to anyone else? What do you do?
