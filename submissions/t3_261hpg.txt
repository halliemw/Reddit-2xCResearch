Is 18 a good age? I think it depends on the person. Many people are  ready for sex and able to consent at 14 while some people don't seem ready until 20 or older. I think it might be better to be 16 because most people at that age want to have sex anyway and would probably prefer to be with a more experienced person. I knew a dozen girls in high school who dated guys in their 20s and I feel like most girls tend to be more attracted to 30-year-old than 17-year-old celebrity.

Is 18 fine or do you think it should be changed? Some countries in Europe and Asia have age of consent as 14 or younger but I think that's far too young. Only a minority of boys and girls are "mentally adult" at that age.
