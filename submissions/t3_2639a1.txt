I haven't heard anyone discussing this facet- I'm wondering if it will be a factor. Anyone who has had an ex (or whoever) post pictures of them online know how hard it can be to take them down, and how easy it is for employers and other people to find them. Might there be a higher legal recourse in the EU now?
