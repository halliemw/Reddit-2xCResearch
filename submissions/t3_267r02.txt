I've had my Mirena for a little over a year now. It's the first form of birth control I've ever used (go for the big guns!) and I was hoping this would be the end all, be all for me. All of the things I was worried about symptom wise (weight gain and acne primarily) have not been a problem since having the Mirena inserted. Didn't kill my libido, either, which was a relief. On the flip side, I have developed a whole host of other problems, many of which I barely or never dealt with before having my Mirena inserted, including:

- thinning hair (like...worryingly thin. Not coming out in clumps, but I've noticed a bit of a receding hairline)
- two ovarian cysts (one ruptured and put me in the hospital, the other is a dermoid that will have to be surgically removed at some point)
- all sorts of stomach/digestive issues 
- Several yeast infections and one mild case of BV
- hip/joint/back pain. This is the most troubling part. It's gotten exceptionally bad over the past few months...to the point where I can't walk more than a mile or two without my legs/hips/back SCREAMING in pain. Day to day I have an all over achey/blah feeling. I'm getting some bloodwork done to check for arthritis (which seems to be a rarely reported side effect of Mirena) and I'm 29 years old, for goodness sake!

I have also had three really horrible colds and one tonsil infection since last April...after not getting sick for almost a year and a half before having the Mirena put in.

I keep trying to think of other things that could be causing these issues. Maybe the cysts were just a fluke. (Doubtful, according to my gyno.) Maybe I just need better shoes for the joint pain. Maybe the thinning hair/all over blah-ness is from stress. (I have been under an exceptional amount...mostly because of the emotional and financial strain all these medical issues have put me through.) At what point, though, do you think you CAN contribute symptoms to the IUD?

The situation is seriously stressing me out. Mirena has been great for it's intended use...condom-free sex is so much better for me and my boyfriend and I am not at all worried about any mishaps. I'm not sure I would be this comfortable with other methods...so the thought of having to switch to other options is (unnecessarily?) freaking me out. 

So I just want some opinions. Do you think the Mirena could be at fault here? Is there a chance that it's just taking longer for my body to regulate itself? 

For those who had Mirena removed...what was your next option? I don't want to deal with the Depo weight gain (after losing 95 pounds) and I have a hard time remembering to take vitamins, let alone a birth control pill. The implant freaks me out but I'd maybe consider it...though I watched a youtube video of it being inserted and I almost passed out. 

Thoughts on NuvaRing post-IUD? I don't know if the effectiveness is high enough for me to consider using it without a condom. I also don't want the hormones to turn me into more of a stressed wreck than I already normally am.

Sorry for all the questions...I'm just going crazy over the whole thing and I'm super, super bummed I might have to get rid of the IUD (even despite all the side effects it may be causing.)
