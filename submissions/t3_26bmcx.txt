Hey 2x. So I was reading a post in another sub (choosing not to link anywhere/edit out a bit of the post for the person's privacy) that reminded me of a girl I used to be pretty close to. There were really no boundaries in the friendship as far as what's on/off the tables for discussion, so communication was usually good. 

That having been said, the one thing I could never figure out how to best react to was questions about what I think of her body, or simply how to respond to "progress pictures" when the sender was already criticizing herself on/off. We fooled around a couple of times, of course I was attracted to her and told her as much, but occasionally I'd sort of freeze up and not know how to respond in a situation where I was worried I might hurt some feelings. Anyways here's the example that reminded me of it all:


>I'm ridiculously preoccupied with my weight. I feel gross all the time, I take ages getting ready and go all out with makeup and accessories so I can distract from my fat but still feel feel like people are judging my body when I go out. I fantasize all day about how I would change my body and get depressed often. Even though my SO says he loves my body and thinks I'm beautiful I can't help but feel like he is lying to me to spare my feelings. I get told often that I'm not fat, that I'm tiny, that my face has no fat, that im beautiful, etc. But it's not what I see in pictures or in the mirror.


Realistically what is there to do or say, what would you prefer to hear? I don't mean from a stranger on the internet when posting something like this, but in a conversation with someone you trust and care for. If I find myself talking to someone in the future who feels similarly about themselves I'd like to be able to handle things better.
