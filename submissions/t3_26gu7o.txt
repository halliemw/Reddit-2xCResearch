My GF just got home and said while she was  driving she peed her pants a little bit without even feeling it. How bad is this? Is she pregnant? She is 23 years old, white, 5'7", 150 lbs, and pretty healthy, She recently did a short smoothie diet, but started trying to eat mostly raw foods a few days ago... Whats going on? Please help to ease my own mind and hers. Dont know whether it matters but the urine kind of stained the leather seat she was on, and she would usually be starting her period nowish, or within the week. Thank you for your time :) 

edit: just trying to get some information to help us out before we can see a doctor. Also i do not care about the leather seats I just imagine that they dont normally stain and the fact that the did might be indicative of something...
