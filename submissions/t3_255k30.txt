I'm one of those fortunate folk who get a lottt of ingrown hairs. It started when I began epiliating and got so bad, I had a whole bunch of scars all over my legs because I'm a sucker for squeezing. Recently had a horrible time where I was trying to get them to heal quicker by sticking some tea tree on a plaster and popping it over the offending areas. Unfortunately, I had some sort of allergic reaction so I've got some plaster-shaped scars. Bio-Oiling the shit out of those! 

Things I've done to try and sort it out: switched to waxing. Bought a shedload of TendSkin and use it every day. Been super-vigilant with exfoliating and moisturising - I'm a big Lush fan, so it's been Buffy all the way plus Dream Cream in between showers. It's getting better, slowly but surely. What do you use to prevent/treat ingrown hairs?

TL:DR Get lots of ingrown hairs, wonder what you all do to sort those suckers out
