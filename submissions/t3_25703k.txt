A lot of people on 4chan and the internet have told me to kill myself. It's made me numb inside. It makes me feel like shit and I start contemplating the meaning of life and stuff.

I just played a game with my boyfriend and acquaintances that I don't know well but play with for fun where someone told me to kill myself for using a certain item yet my boyfriend didn't even stand up for me. I didn't respond either. I just feel like extreme shit. I have no thick skin at all.

I'm not suicidal but it makes me feel like garbage. How do I get thick skin?
