I'm very fed up with this! It's kind of hard to explain the situation but it ended in me getting a private class before her, she's usually first and then I have my class. The class was only an hour -I chopped off mine so that she could start earlier. 

So, there was some misunderstanding tonight and I somehow thought that I was supposed to be before her. (We have private classes once every week).

We have often before exchanged classes with *no* problems, even without calling each other first, because we were both free over these two hours that our classes are, so if the other asked to exchange, the other usually would just wait and get ready for her class while she waited.

Anyways, tonight I was supposed to be after her but for some reason my schedule said that I should be first, and that made it possible for me to accept a meetings afterwards. (work related, so I kind of couldn't skip it, but it would have been manageble and solvable if I wouldn't be free). 

So, I start my class, and suddenly she just rushed in, furious, saying that she has places to be and that she needs her class RIGHT THEN. She [friend, lets call her Y) then walks out, very upset and angry. (She's usually very down-to-earth and relaxed about things like that, but's she's been very up-high for the last month and has been acting weird towards me, like we weren't friends, almost as if I had done something that could have hurt her, **which I know that I haven't done, and I have talked to her about that, and she said that it wasn't so, she also said that everything was okay**).  

I realize my mistake and offer her to take my class (technically hers). She said no and walked away.

On with the class;The teacher somehow tries to find a way so we both can have at least some time each, and we talked together and decided that I would finish earlier, so she could start earlier and therefore quit earlier and be on time. Y accepted this idea and said that it would be alright to be late for this thing she was supposed to be. **I know that I made a mistake with that class and told her. I offered her to take the class, and said that I would change my meeting, she said no, that we'd do like the teacher suggested**. So we keep on with my class, with me thinking things were alright between Y and me.

Anyways, she comes *late* for her class, (I had no idea what the time was) and I have a lot of stuff to take out of the classroom so as soon as she walked in I started packing my stuff and in the meantime I'm talking with the teacher about next class while I'm picking up my stuff, while she get's ready. She's ready before me and I told them just to start and don't mind me while I finished. (I repeat; *I had PLENTY of stuff to take out*). I finish; I hurry out and Y seems to be okay with this and we say our good byes. She though refused to start with me in the room. I don't know why; that hasn't been a problem before.

Anyways, I'm home after the class, just getting ready for my meeting, and my phone rings. 

That's her to tell me what a terrible person I am, that I can't suddenly change classes like that and that I can't be like this and that and can't behave like that before calling her first. Saying that I should have hurried more out from the classroom, saying that I should have stopped the class earlier...etc She is going apeshit in the phone, almost screaming at me. 

I was so shocked that I couldn't even start to explain my side of the situation. The only thing that I could think of was "she was late to her class anyway, why is she blaming it on me?!"

She keeps on, telling me how I ruined her evening, that she had TWO very important place to be right after that goddam class! **She only mentioned one thing to do, and she had said that it would be okay to be late for it**.

She then goes on saying how her evening was a complete disaster because of me. That she missed the first thing, AND ALSO THE LATER THING. Because her class started 15 mins later than usually! 

We live in a *very* small city and she was on car. There was no fucking way that she could have missed two things in a row. Unless she was supposed to be on the other side of the country!

At this point, I have tears in my eyes, trying to tell her that I was sorry for that, that it was a mistake that I made, I knew that and I had tried to fixed that earlier, so she could have everything like she needed. But she hadn't mentioned the second thing, said that it would have been okay to be late for the first thing **and** she also accepted the idea that our teacher came up with. I tried to ask her why she didn't just said straight away that she needed the class, right then. And why she wouldn't take my offer etc.etc.etc. She wasn't listening.

While I'm trying to explain myself, she's just practically throwing shit at me. Things like:
 
*"You are *so* terrible!" 
*"It's **your** fault that my evening is ruined" 
*"You cannot make mistakes like that EVER!" 
*"I need *you* to call *me* when you make decisions like that!!!" 
*"My evening sucked because of you and your decisions!"

These things were screamed at me. Like that I made the decision of making a mistake. Once. Like I had the intentions of ruining her little something, that she couldn't even tell what was, or why it was so important.

She wouldn't listen to me till I raised my voice a little and asked "Why didn't you said anything?" **Because she didn't**

This is such a silly thing to be upset with, but I did **SO NOT** deserved that! She's the one that has always been changing the classes, she's the one that's been getting a little extra time because she always goes a little into my class, and I've always been very relaxed about it. I have only once before had to change the class before, and I called her 4 days prior! 

I've always done my best to be nice, offer her rides (because, we live in the same neighbourhood) and stuff like that. I've never said anything mean to her, and I think that I have only been a good friend. And I cannot see, why on earth, she thinks that it's alright to call me like that and act like that. I don't feel like I deserve that. Yes, she would have been late for that first thing, because of me, but she said that it was ok! Also acted like that!


Oh, and also; when I tried to make my apology -just getting this case over and done, guess what she replied? 

"Yeah right, I'll consider it". 

That was it, and I hung up.


I will see this girl at school tomorrow, and the day after that, etc. I'm still in a kind of a shock, she has never acted like that towards me before and I'm trying to figure out weather to talk to her about this and tell her how upset she got me, or if to ignore her, until she finds a reason to talk to me, either to shame on me or talk. 

**TL;DR** I made a mistake, tried to make up for it, reverse it, whatever. Friend acted like it was okay, we arranged things. Got a phonecall later from her, where she screamed at me and acted like I had intentionally ruined her evening. She would not take my apology. Also would not tell me exactly what I ruined. I feel like I did not deserve that kind of behaviour.
