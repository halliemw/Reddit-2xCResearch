Hi everyone,

My boyfriend and I always use condoms and I'm not on BC but I've never had a problem. Except last month, we had sex where the condom broke during my period. Even though my ovulation is about 2 weeks after, we went and got a plan b which I took about an hour or so after the condom breaking. 

In this past month I've had many lifestyle changes that could also affect my period: Finals which means lots of stress, moving home which changed my diet, got prescribed adderall which helped me lose around 8 lbs in the last month, and my sleeping schedule has changed quite a lot. 

However, with all of these changes, my period is really late, even more so than usual (6 days so far). I'm going to get a test tomorrow which would make it a week late and hopefully be accurate? Are these symptoms (medication, weightloss, stress, diet change, sleep change) enough to delay my period by 6 days? Usually I'm a day or 2 late, but this is a lot and it worries me.
