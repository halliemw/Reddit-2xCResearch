Before anyone gets upset, yes, I do appreciate my body and I'm not trying to impress a boy or anything like that. However, I would really like a non-surgical way to get bigger breasts. I'm not good at gaining weight and I'm starting on the pill soon. I'm a 34B by the way. Thank you so so much to those who help. :-)
Oh and I saw a "boost your bust" program, have any of y'all tried it? I don't really want to pay if it doesn't work.
