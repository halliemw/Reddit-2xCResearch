I would just be interested to hear about the decision and the experience.  Was it because you didn't find an opposite sex partner by the time you wanted kids?  Maybe you never wanted one in the first place?  What about dating as a single mother by choice and finding a partner later?  How is the experience overall?  Thanks!
