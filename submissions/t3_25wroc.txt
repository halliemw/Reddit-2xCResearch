I recently went to a burlesque show for the first time and could not get into it. For those of you who have ever seen a burlesque show, did you enjoy yourselves?

The show basically consisted of several themed strip teases, one after the other, for ~2 hours. Each one involved the girl's bare ass in your face--a lot--and each ended with the big reveal of breasts with pasties/tassels.

The girls were of completely varying body types and you could tell they felt empowered and were having a ton of fun. I wanted to just relax and enjoy it like everyone else, but it was so overtly sexual that I couldn't shake my discomfort (as someone who's not sexually attracted to women).

I apologize if I should have posted this in /r/AskWomen instead, I just wanted to hear from you here :)
