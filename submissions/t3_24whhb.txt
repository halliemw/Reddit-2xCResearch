I(24) just found out I'm pregnant. I'm not ready for a baby. I don't have enough to support it, plus, my career is just kicking off. It's simply not a good time. I used the pill and condoms but somehow it still happened. 


My boyfriend (25) and I agreed before sex that if I were to be pregnant we'd abort. Two years later here we are. He says he can't bear the thought of it and that if I abort he's not sure if we can stay together. I love this guy to death. We were planning on getting married in the next year. That he would break up with me over a clump of (life ruining) cells hurts, but I know he doesn't see it that way. Still I feel cheated that he changed his views. I know it's different when you're actually experiencing it, but still. 


With our income combined we make over six figures, so whenever I say we can't afford it he brings that up. But ideally I'd want to have much much more in my savings before bringing a kid in the world. Plus like I said, the timing is awful. I'm not ready to be a parent. Three-four years-sure. Now-no. 



I'm very conflicted because I really want an abortion but I also love my boyfriend deeply. I try to explain to him why I'm not ready for a kid but he remains steadfast.



 On top of worrying about my relationship's future I also have to worry about getting the actual abortion, because my parents are pro-life and I don't really feel comfortable asking my friends to go with me to something like this. My boyfriend refuses to go. I can't go alone, since I'm getting anesthesia (unless I wait in the hospital for hours while it wears off.) I at least want him there with me, but he absolutely refuses. 



Sorry if this is jumbled, I'm pretty stressed. I feel like the clock is ticking and on one hand I want to get on with my life asap, but on the other hand I don't want to hurt my boyfriend, who I thought I'd spend my life with. Help?  



Tl,dr:


-Used 2 bc methods, got pregnant anyway (I was on an antibiotic for a few days and I think a condom may have broken once (*once!*). In retrospect it was stupid, but at the time I thought I was covered and it was fine.)


-I don't feel ready for a baby, financially and maturity wise. My boyfriend of 2 years does. 


-He says if I abort we'll probably break up because the thought of it disturbs him so much. I say I just can't have a child now. 


-I haven't scheduled an appointment yet. I know I want to but I keep waiting, hoping he'll come around (even though I know he won't.) What to do?
