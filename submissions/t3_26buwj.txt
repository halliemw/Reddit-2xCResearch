I can't think of a very coherent way of wording all this into paragraphs so will bullet point everything relevant. I thought this might be a better place than relationships/relationship advice seeing as I'm not interested in anyone at the moment and aren't looking for anyone, it's more about me.

* I'm 20, female, British
* I've lost 2 stone in the last year and am now a healthy weight
* I rarely get male attention
* I've had a rough few months and have been depressed and pretty much every aspect of my life has changed in the last year
* Things still keep going wrong and it seems like I'll never be happy and nothing will go right
* My first boyfriend ended up nearly abusing me and pretty much threatened to sexually assault/rape me so I left him. I was with him for just under 3 years. 
* After leaving him my sex drive was low and I struggled at the idea of trusting guys to be intimate with me
* A male friend who I thought was the nicest guy in the world told me that he liked me. He was very inexperienced. We got quite far quite soon. But then he kept changing his mind then dumped me. I felt kinda used and the reasons he gave for not liking me lowered my confidence.
* Other things that he and others have said have knocked my confidence. Plus they said that I'm the opposite of all the things that I'm happy about myself - personality and physically. So now there's nothing I like about myself
* I'm a nervous wreck. I'm scared that guys will either say they like me then use me and dump me ... or if they stick around, they'll turn out to be like my first boyfriend. 
* I have even less interest in sex than the time between seeing those two guys. But I just want someone to love me. But who wants to love a nervous wreck especially one that there's nothing to like about? I feel unlovable. 
* Before when I've been single I've not had much confidence/hope, but now I've got virtually none. And before there were things I liked about myself, that I hoped guys would see in me and like.

I have no idea what advice/support anyone can give me. Maybe one of you has felt this way before. I hope someone has something to say that helps. It's a bit of a getting things off my chest post. I've been to counselling about all of my problems including the way my first boyfriend treated me and its just made me feel worse about everything.
