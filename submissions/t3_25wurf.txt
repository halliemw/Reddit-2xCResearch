I'm just here to vent. I'm a successful, moderately attractive woman (i.e. I don't have a smaller baby head jutting out of my regular head or anything). I'm kind. I smile. I'm interested in lots of things. Yet it seems I will be perpetually lonely. 

I was always ostracized as a kid. I don't know why it's continued into adulthood. I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to feel bitter and angry about it. I try not to let this shadow me--I know people can smell it a mile away. Hell, how on earth would it have come across in an application to join a freakin' group on the internet?! I was all sunshine and kitten asses!

Sigh. Sorry if this comes across as mean-spirited. It's a silly thing, but it tapped into a bunch of stuff from my childhood/rest of my life. I guess I'm just feeling really raw and triggered right now. It's incredibly hurtful to be told over and over again, in big ways and small, that I'm not part of the tribe. It's psychologically unhealthy.

I don't think I'm that boring or awful. Or scary or mean. I'm not sure why I have no friends.

Edit: Oh my gosh, guys, you're all amazing. I love this thread. WHY DID I DO THIS ON A THROWAWAY?! It's early in the morning here, so need to go to bed, but I will read more replies in the morning. All of you are included in the Arbiters of Local Women group, none of your applications will be denied!

Edit 2: I'm awake! I have things to do today, but I want to reply to everybody!

Edit 3: There is no way I can respond to every comment, like I wanted to. I am reading them, though, and I'm so grateful for everyone who takes the time to respond. I'm also glad some people have found a place to vent here. You're all awesome!
