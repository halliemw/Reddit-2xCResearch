I've never been to a doctor before, I've always been really normal and healthy and the like. Been to a chiropractor for my scoliosis for two years but that's it. We recently got insurance (hooray!) so my mum (15F here) was planning to take me to a doctor for a check up of sorts for the first time in the next month or two.

However, based on guessing (my dog has had one before) I *think* I might have a UTI? I really don't want to bring it up unless it's a serious possibility and I feel like I might be blowing it out of proportion. With that said, I've had the following symptoms without progressively getting any worse, for maybe the last 5 days or so.

- I feel like I've been having to pee a lot more than usual (5-7 times a day now maybe? normally in my life I only go to the bathroom 2-3 times)
- I've been getting like super super mild period cramps that last for 20 seconds maybe once an hour, but not on my period.
- I've been feeling really dehydrated despite drinking about the same I usually do in my life.

I feel like this is just nothing since my urine looks normal, no major cramping, no vomiting or nausea, I'm not peeing like *a lot* or anything, etc. But I also read somewhere that some people have had really really mild UTIs that they could barely tell they even noticed symptoms.
