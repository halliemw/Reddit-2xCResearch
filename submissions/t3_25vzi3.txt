Sorry if this is TMI but I just need to get some answers. 

Basically, I've been getting what seems like quite heavy discharge for about a month now. This week though it dries really sticky, rather than going crusty it dries more like an earwax consistency and is quite creamy and thick. Today and yesterday it's been like a brown colour, this could be my period coming on but i'm not due for another week or two. Also, it's totally odourless.
My vagina can be quite itchy also so I usually put some sudocrem or E45 on before bed and then wash it off in the morning. 

I'm really not sure what this is, whether its just my body doing it's thing or something  else. Just in case you need some context i'm 18 and not sexually active. Anyone had the same thing? When does it go away?
