I say [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/24zsxz/any_suggestions_for_a_first_time_hair_removal/) post, and I've heard that bikini-zone hair removal creams exist, but for the life of me I can't find any. Was wondering if you ladies had any suggestions.

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I think I'm going to try the Nair Sensitive one. I'm in the UK and not really sure where to buy it, but it's on Amazon UK so I might just do that. :)
