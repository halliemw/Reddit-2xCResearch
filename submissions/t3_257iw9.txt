Hello all. This may belong in a health subreddit but I am looking for opinions straight from the mouths of my fellow TwoXChromosones chums. Basically, in my teens my PMS manifested purely in chocolate addiction. However, in the past year or two (I am 21) it has manifested in long bouts of crying, neediness, anxiety and insecurity. This lasts for about 4 days leading into my period and then it all stops and I go back to being a chill happy go lucky and mostly sane human being. 
I was wondering if there are any supplements or vitamins one takes to help these mood symptoms? I've googled it but I would like some personal opinions/anecdotes! Thanks very much, from a hormonal woman!


Edit: Oops, I should have said that I am on BC, Ovranette to be precise! I have seen forums on the internet discussing the effect Ovranette has on mood, so any advice on different BC to use would be also welcome!
