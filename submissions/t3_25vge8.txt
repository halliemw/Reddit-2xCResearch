For the past 2 years I have been with a man who is sexually, physically and emotionally abusive. It took me a very long time to realise that this was in fact true. I would constantly lie to myself and make excuses for his behaviour, convincing myself that his unjustifiable actions were in fact completely justifiable. It was only when I sat down and told my counsellor everything from start to finish and watched her expression turn from concerned to aghast that I finally admitted to myself what had been going on.

Do other people have this problem?

EDIT: Thank you so much for the replies. It's very comforting to know that I am not the only one whole has felt like this. In four weeks I'm moving to the other side of the world to teach English, this is how I'm leaving him. It's a 'soft' break, because there will be no dramatic exit or massive argument, as far as he is concerned it's a 1 month 'holiday'. It's actually a years contract, after which I'm planning to do some travelling. I know I'll cry on the plane and I know I will regularly miss him and want to go back, but I won't. I KNOW this is the right thing and after a month or so I doubt I'll even be able to remember why I stayed for so long.
