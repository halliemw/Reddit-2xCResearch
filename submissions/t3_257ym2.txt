I'm not sure if I'm expressing this correctly, but it can sometimes be extremely patronizing. I wasn't really aware of how frequently it occurred until I was washing my car a couple days ago and my boyfriend goes, "You're so cute washing that car!" my original thought was, "no... I'm just washing a car..." Then I started realizing how frequently people will tell me that. For example, the lab coats are all too big "haha that's cute", try to argue a political point "it's cute how you get defensive". When my boyfriend does it it's fine because he does think I'm cute, but when other men do it; it really seems inappropriate.

Not sure what I'm looking for, maybe stories or validation? I understand that it's not meant in a malevolent manner, but it does make me feel disrespected when it happens. Any thoughts on this or a proper response? It's great people think I'm cute, but I'd rather not be cute and just be a co-worker or fellow student. (and yes, I realize I can be a cute co-worker at the same time. It just seems that the "it's cute" response points out that I am doing something I shouldn't be, or that women typically aren't seen doing, and it makes me feel awkward.)
