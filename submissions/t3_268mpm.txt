I am 25, soon to be 26. My boyfriend is 42. He has never had kids (neither have I) but I can tell he is thinking about it. He doesn't want to be pushy, but time is kind of running out for him. He says he is fine whatever I decide. But he's great with his friends' kids and I think he would be a good dad. I am in school and not willing to have kids right this moment. I just can't help but to be sensitive to the fact that I need to start thinking about it for the next couple of years... I need to think, "he is going to be how old when the kid is 18?" This is an unavoidable issue we will have to face as a couple. I just don't know. I love him and I want to have kids... In like 5 years. That's a little late for him. Anyone been in a similar situation?
