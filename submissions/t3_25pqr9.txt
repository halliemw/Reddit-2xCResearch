This is a throwaway account because of the people involved and wishing to protect them. 

An acquaintance of mine has been a long standing employee at her job, and we were looking at some information when she pointed out that she makes $20,000 less a year than the other people of her equal position and power... who are 90% men. 

She's lived with it a long time, and retires in less than a decade. She goes above and beyond what's really required of her position to try and branch out networking and communication, but she has gone unappreciated (which hasn't really bothered her) and a newly arisen issue of someone trying to seriously put her down has made her question that maybe she should stand her ground a little more firmly. 

THE PROBLEM: She retires in less than a decade, so does she risk her job to get the equal pay and privilege? How would she do that without going straight to the legal department? What's the best way someone's beat this without causing a serious uproar? **Is it worth it?**
