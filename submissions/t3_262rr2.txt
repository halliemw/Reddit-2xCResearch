I had to make a throw away account, since my ex actively checks mine. I have a few (about 3), guy friends(ages 27-31) who have come out of serious, long term relationships(they were dumped), and cannot get over their significant others and want to change for them. One, for example, has changed his whole lifestyle to fit what she wants, even though she told him to move on. The second, is still hanging on, hoping he can prove to his SO that he can communicate better. The third, is just completely in love and will do anything to make her take him back. 

Every time I have come out of a relationship, I have analyzed and reflected upon what has happened and tried to work on my shortcomings, but I have never gotten back with an ex or waited for one and vice versa. 

Has anyone else witnessed this in their guy friends - holding on to someone and trying to prove to them that they will change, even though the relationship has failed and the women are actively moving on? They are all great, put together guys, but they refuse to move on.

Why does this happen so frequently?
