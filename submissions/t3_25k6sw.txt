If this is the wrong place to post, just let me know! But I thought you guys would be the most understanding. I was going to make a throwaway for this because we're default now but I don't think this is something I should feel bad about.

So I met a guy like 4 years older than me (I'm 18) back in January, right after my boyfriend and I had broken up. I told him right away that I only wanted to be friends and while I didn't really pursue the friendship, he did. 

He was constantly pestering me to hang out and the few times we did, he would get all touchy feely and insist on paying for my coffee or whatever, which really was not necessary. 

After a few times of him making me uncomfortable like that, I started to answer his texts less and less. Now once every two weeks or so he'll text me a long version of "I miss you, did I do something wrong? Let's hang out!" And I never know what to say, so I'll usually say I'm just busy, but I know that's not a solution.

I don't really want anything to do with him at this point, not only for the reasons I stated above but because I honestly don't enjoy his company. Also, I know this isn't his fault but he reminds me of a really unhappy time in which I was really hurting because of the breakup. 

He texted me again two days ago and I still haven't answered because I don't want to be mean. I know how shitty it is to be ignored and I don't want to make him feel bad, but I really would be happy to never see him or hear from him again. How do I make this happen in the nicest way possible? 

Thanks twox
