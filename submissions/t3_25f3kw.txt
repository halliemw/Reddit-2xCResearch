Ladies please help: 

When I'm having PIV sex I sometimes reach the point that I can feel myself building up and getting close to having an orgasm. However, whenever this happens my boyfriend almost always ends up finishing before I can climax.

For some reason if I can't orgasm (and I'm close) it feels like a wave of sadness crashes into me and I involuntarily start to tear up and...cry. It's not because I'm consciously upset that I couldn't orgasm - I love my partner, and I love having sex, and not finishing is something that I'm used to. It's the act of *almost* getting there, but not being able to that makes my body react this way.

I attribute it to the build up of hormones and not being able to find a release, but I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else? I can't be the only crazy one out there, right?

I end up feeling awful because of the emotions I can't help but feel, but also because I need to comfort my boyfriend and tell him it isn't his fault. It's the worst of both worlds - I've reached the point that I would almost rather not try for an orgasm than almost get there and experience this. 

EDIT: Thanks so much for all the replies! Hearing what each of you has to say about this has been incredibly helpful, and I don't feel so nearly alone in this anymore.
