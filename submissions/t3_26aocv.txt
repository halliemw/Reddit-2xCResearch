Hey 2X! 

My sister is turning 16 soon and I want to do something special with her for this milestone in her life. I want this to be a bonding experience that will bring us closer together as sisters. I feel like I have failed the "big sister" role and I want to be there for her in the future. Recently, some family members have made comments toward my sister about how she is not as task oriented or focused as me and this has really hurt her feelings. I think some bonding time with her will get me to open up to her and tell her she doesn't need to follow in my footsteps and she can forge her own life. 

Any suggestions for activities or advice is much appreciated!

A little insight to me and my sister's interests:

Me- I work in IT. I steer away from very crowded places. I love music, practically all types. I love the outdoors (camping, hiking, etc.). Travelling is amazing :)

Sissy- Loves to craft! Everything from scrap-booking, making jewelry, and pottery. She loves shopping. She loves music (mostly pop, but she enjoys a bit of alternative rock as well). Kind of a girly girl, but she is open minded and willing to try new things. 

P.S. First post here, been lurking for awhile but this topic is really important to me.

Thanks!
