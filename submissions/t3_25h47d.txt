I consider myself to be a fairly attractive female. I'm in my early 30's single, two kids, divorced for about 2 years. I'm not big prize or whatever. I just know exactly what I'm looking for, and more specifically, what I'm not looking for. I was married for a really long time to a very controlling man and I'm just now starting to come into my own, and am very assertive and confident in myself now, where I used to be very docile. 

However, lately, if a guy tries to hit on me, and I politely say I'm not interested, I get, "Bitch."

WHY AM I A BITCH FOR NOT FLIRTING WITH YOU? 

I know the answer, they are butthurt from being rejected and they are projecting it onto me, but it's still so annoying. 

Sorry, rant over.
