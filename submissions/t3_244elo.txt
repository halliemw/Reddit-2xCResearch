I'm considering going on birth control and would like to hear your recommendations on what has worked for you with minimal side effects so when I go into my OBGYN I have done some research and can have an educated discussion. I am really only interested in the pill (for probably paranoid reasons I'm sure but I'm sticking to my guns on just pills). Background info below if it helps.

I'm 23 and have never been pregnant but my biggest dream in life is to be a mother. I am so nervous about birth control taking that away from me (don't know why, just am) so I would like some suggestions from women who have had children after being on the pill if possible. I also am not interested in pills that you only have 4 periods a year for this reason. It just seems like its not so good for your body. (Not meant to be judgy. I would just be really paranoid about it for myself.)

I only have one ovary. A little over a year ago I found out (painfully btw) that I had a dermoid tumor on my left ovary which had cut off blood supply damaging it beyond repair. This all adds to my over protection of the ovary/eggs I do have left. I am not on any hormone supplements (the body is a weird but wonderful thing) and have had a regular fluid filled cyst already on my right ovary.

I have always prided myself on not being an emotional person so pills with little to no emotional swing side effects would be awesome--though I know each pill effects each person differently. Minimal weight gain would also be much appreciated.

TL;DR-- Ladies on Birth Control Pills. What has worked for you and why do you like it? What should I really stay away from? What are good questions to ask my OBGYN?
