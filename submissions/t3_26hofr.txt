Hello! So I might be a tad paranoid here but some weird things have been happening. This is the first month of my new birth control (changed brands) I started it when I started my last period. I currently have 3 days worth of active pills (plus the 7 sugar pills)

Last Wednesday and yesterday I have a very light spotting which I read could be implantation. My boobs hurt like crazy..... but! I have also recently started lifting weights that would work out my chest and I am not sure if its just a sore muscle or sore breasts. Crap ton of headaches and dizzy some times. 
I would murder someone to eat some bread but I am also doing a /r/keto  diet so I've been deprived of it for a while. I know it's too soon to do a pee test but I'm just wondering, or I guess I just need to get it out of my system, am I looking too hard into this or does it really sound like super duper early signs?

Ps. I have been pregnant once before, doctors recommended ("off the record") to terminate because it was like a month after a chemo treatment and a bunch of other class D pills. I found out I was pregnant at the 2nd week because of consistent projectile vomiting.
