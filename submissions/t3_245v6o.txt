So I really hope this doesn't come off as gender-generalizing or inducing drama... I believe this is a legitimate issue. A lot of female gamers get harassed online either through private messaging or chat forums on the gaming sites - particularly RPG games. It feels like women are blamed for "being beautiful" and that they should like the harassment because they are getting attention. The most disturbing thing about the harassment of women online to me personally is when it's a minor. I was 17, a minor in Texas, and I posted that very clearly on my profile of a gaming site I had joined. Men in their 30's were still messaging me saying "Hey beautiful, what's up?" I was 17 years old, and hounded by mysterious guys much older than me. One guy from India kept trying to get me to marry him. I don't care if they are "trolling." It is harassment, and it makes me really uncomfortable to play online games anymore which sucks because I love gaming! I have gotten some obscene messages in my inbox before, as a 17 year old girl, and I still get them now. I guess I just wonder if any other female gamers on here have experienced this, and what were their thoughts on the matter?

I want to make a note now: I do NOT believe for one second that all men are out to prey on women in the gaming community. I just think it happens a lot more than it should - and I believe it is related to the way people view women, and I wanted to hear others' thoughts on it.
