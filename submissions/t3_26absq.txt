Tonight was a breaking point. I asked my boyfriend to go to a game with my friends and I. I always (almost on a weekly basis)  hang out with him and his friends where I only know him. I was so stoked to have him there with us! This was very important for me. He was looking up baseball facts during the game so I looked over and the only thing I see is his message to his friend asking for help he was stuck with crazy girls at a baseball game. I seriously didn't mean to pry, I just caught him doing it. I'm immediately heartbroken told him he didn't have to come and ignore him for awhile. Thats the only thing I could do to keep from crying. 

There have been other instances similar to this not involving phones. Just little things where he is only thinking of him and not us. I go with him to anything he wants to do. We live together and I am always thinking of what he would want to do or if something would fit with his schedule. More and more lately he is only thinking of himself. 

Tonight was just another piece of wood thrown on the fire. I don't know who to trust. I guess I'm tired of being the only person worried about this relationship at all. Everything is 'just fine'  to him. 

I'm mid 20s he is 30. I'm sick of trying to fight for any respect. How do you gain respect in a relationship? Is this just over?

EDIT: I should have mentioned we have been together 4 years.  

Thank you for your replies!
