I'm curious what other people thought of this first episode. 

There's a part of me that liked it and found parts of it very funny. But another part of me that was very uncomfortable with the show perpetuating the trope of pretend lesbians who are just doing things for a guys attention. It looks like they're going to develop things further and make it more complex, but it still feels a bit off.

I did like a lot though that it was set in Austin. I'm pleased to see Texas represented in the media in a way that shows a different side of Texas.

What did you all think?
