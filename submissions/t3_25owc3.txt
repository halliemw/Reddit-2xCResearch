Hi guys, longtime lurker but I would love your input. 

Basically, I had a series of infections ( strep/uti -> kidney infection/ weird allergic response to antibiotics ) and believed that I was essentially one of the unlucky people who are more susceptible to yeast infections. After a year of std tests and other random medications, it  turns out that I have lichen sclerosus- but luckily not visibly matching that on the image search. Essentially, I get intense bursts of extreme itchiness. Yeast infection itchy, and any friction (especially the kind due to penetrative intercourse) makes my bits swell up to blue waffle proportions. And semen *burns* ( I'm not allergic, it's probably due to the microtearing of my skin).

For anyone who has it, I suggest silicone lube, it helps a lot. It has made sex a lot less painful for me.  I used an high concentration corticosteroid which does stop the itching when applied, however, the irritated patches of skin have never completely healed.  I'm able to have a relatively normalish sex life again with minimal pain/swelling, but I'm definitely dryer than I have been in the past. Also, the longer the session, the more likely I'll really swell up. 

I'm just wondering now if I'm associating the pain caused by lichen with sex, or if it's a sign it's just something about my current relationship that isn't doing it for me anymore. I wasn't always like this. I used to love it, and now I don't really care. My partner is so understanding, and he hates to cause me pain. But I just feel so guilty for my lack of interest, when it's obvious that his drive is so high.
