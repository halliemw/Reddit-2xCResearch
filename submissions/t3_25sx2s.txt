Even if the dreaded M word feels too radical, buying into the term "slut shaming" feels like buying into the sexist idea that there are sluts in the first place (just don't shame them for it). Some might argue that they're taking the term back and using it in a positive light (I myself have used it while talking dirty in the bedroom), but I don't think it works for this case, and I could never use it politically. Am up to discuss this but I had to get it out there.
