I feel like I'm throwing everything away.  My boyfriend (M/25) and I (F/23) have been dating for 3 years.  I was upfront about the fact that I am asexual from the start, but it's created a mismatch in sex thats been a problem for a while.  Not wanting kids came out later (as it would), and everytime it has come up, he'd be annoyed that I was making a decision on that so early.

We hit a rough patch a couple months ago, caused by my inability to support him in the ways he needed (we're mostly long-distance, but I don't drive, which creates a lot of strain).  We've tried to work on things, and they were seeming to improve.

He is my rock and probably my best friend of anyone.  On Thursday, he told me that he didn't think it was going to work out.  Given that it was in class at the time, I thought I took it okay.  I wanted to go no-contact, but ultimately decided to keep speaking with him, as he had a change of heart on his decision about 12 hours later.

In the discussion we had, it transpires that he thinks that my not not wanting kids (and not wanting to budge on that), and not enjoying sex (I know it is possible for asexuals to enjoy sex; thus far, I'm not one of them) is an indication that I'm refusing to change and clearly just want to be alone for the rest of my life.

I don't know if I should go back to try and fix things again (or if he'd even be willing).  I don't want to feel like I'm lying the whole time, but I also don't want to be lonely for the rest of my life.  Outside of him, I don't really have any close friends.

I need a hug and a friend.  And some reassurance that some people just want platonic life partners.
