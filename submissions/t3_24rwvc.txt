I'm 25, my friend is 30. I met her at a charity event and she sort of latched onto me and basically "forced" the friendship on me. We have nothing in common really, and I hate to say it but she just really irritates me. She told me right from the get go that she doesn't have many friends, and so I tried to be nice and help boost her confidence, etc, but I'm starting to realize she irritates the living hell out of me. I keep finding excuses not to hang out, but I feel bad. I'm starting to convince myself that I'm a bad person for not liking her, but I just can't really seem to help it. What do I do?
