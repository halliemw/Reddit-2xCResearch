Hi everyone,

I live in a pretty nice condo building that's close by to a school. A lot of Saudi students live here as well. I've noticed a lot of them being obnoxious/rowdy like typical college students before, but it's usually pretty tame. The exception is that one of this group had been arrested a few months back for raping a female student at the university they all attend. 

Yesterday I was waiting to go downstairs when the elevator showed up, with 8 or 9 Saudi guys in their twenties on it. At first, no one would move to let me on, until finally one of them did while the rest snickered and chattered in Arabic. Eventually one of them started trying to talk to me in English and when we got off the elevator began following me out asking me if I'd ever thought about what it'd be like to be with 8 arab men while his friends laughed and egged him on. I mumbled whatever and walked away and that was the end of it.

I get that this isn't a huge deal and it definitely isn't something that should bother me this much, but now I'm really anxious about running into them again in the building and even more stressed that it will be when I'm with my husband who was ready to go looking for them yesterday. I feel like I should at least tell the building management about this in case they've bothered other people. I'm not sure why I feel like I'm making a bigger deal of this than it really needs to be. I've had other guys do similar things, but for some reason this felt really predatory and all the previous times were when I was in a public place I could get away from. 

TL;DR: A guy made some creepy comments to me while he and his friends laughed about it. I live in the same building with them and I'm not sure what to do to deal with the possibility of running into them again.
