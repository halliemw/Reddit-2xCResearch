Right now, I'm just really upset and I really need to vent. I'm so fucking done with creeps and guys who seem to take friendliness as a sign of interest - despite the fact that I'm happily in a 3-year relationship with an amazing man. I know not all guys are like this, it's just some recent interactions that kind of make me upset with these certain types of people.  
  
Last night, a guy who I *thought* was just a friend texted me, asking me if 'hypothetically' I would have sex with him if I didn't have a boyfriend. Obviously, I shot him down immediately and told him that, despite it being a hypothetical question, I have absolutely **no** interest in even considering sleeping with anyone other than my boyfriend. Then he revealed to me that he's depressed and that "some feelings are hard to kill" as well as self-deprecating texts like  "I'm not really the person that most people think of having sex with." FML.   
  
I knew this guy liked me in high school, but I figured that after *three* years and only seeing him *once* during this time, he was over it (I *know* he's had girlfriends in between). We don't even keep in constant contact (we just text each other once in a while and, often, our conversations have day, if not month, long lapses in between). Even in high school, I always made it clear that I had absolutely *no* interest in dating him and that all I was interested in was a friendship. 
  
I feel sort of...betrayed...? I mean, he's suddenly putting me in this awkward position and I sort of feel like maybe he's trying to make me feel guilty for not being interested in him (hence the "I'm not good enough" texts). It's not the first time I've been in this position either...  
  
My cousin's best friend who's 10 years older (kind of borderline creepy, in my opinion) developed feelings for me in January and started getting *super* clingy. I tried being nice, but he just would *not* take no for an answer - despite the fact that he knew I had a boyfriend. Every time I blew up at him, he would bitch to my cousin about how mean I was being and, of course, my cousin takes his side because, *despite his creepiness (my cousin is aware he's a douche and a total creep), he stood by my cousin when no one else would.* It got to the point where he would blow up at me for 'ignoring' him despite the fact I'm currently balancing work, university, and a social life. He **told** me that there were sparks between us (we *literally* only met 4 times...). When I told him that I was not going to talk to him if he kept bringing shit like that up, he got mad and told me not to "threaten our relationship." WTTFFFFFF....   
  
Of course, my boyfriend got pissed and intervened, telling him that he was a fucking creep and to stop contacting me, he *again* went to my cousin and I had to *apologize,* while listening to this fucking asshole talk shit about my boyfriend and him going on about how immature my boyfriend is (right...**he's** immature).   
  
I *only* got out of the situation when he got mad that I was 'ignoring' him (no shit) again and told me, "Fine, I guess I won't bother you again!" and I called him on his bluff, but in a nice way so he can't bitch about it ("Ok, thanks for understanding!"). So far, there has been 2 months of peaceful silence on all social media fronts, but it still makes me so fucking mad when I think about it.  
  
Idk, maybe I'm just overreacting?   
  
Has anyone else been in situations like this? How did you handle it?
