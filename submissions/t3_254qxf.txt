Throwaway account here. 
So, I am totally embarrassed about this aspect of my body and I'm just looking for some advice and hopefully a little "you're not alone in this!". Basics about OP- 28yrs old, yo-yo weight issues over last 10 years & now pre-diabetic.
I've developed some discoloration on the inner part of my butt cheeks, like a large, dark ring. I'm overweight, so I'm sure that has something to do with it but I can assure you, I clean my shit. I've heard about anal bleaching but I'm talking about butt skin here. I've also noticed that my vagina has darkened in skin color too, I don't what the hell is going on down there. So, does anyone have any experience with this and/or some advice on how to get rid of it? I would greatly appreciate it because I'm really self conscious about it.  

Edit: Thanks for your responses!
