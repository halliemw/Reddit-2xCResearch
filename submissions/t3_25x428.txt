Hi TwoX,

I really wanted to share an amazing experience I had today whilst bra shopping. I went in to a store in Australia looking to find a new sports bra. I was having trouble finding one that actually fitted properly and the sales assistant was amazing! She did a fit check for me after I mentioned it didn't feel quite right and then suggested a couple of different style. She brought multiple styles and sizes for me to try and it was an all-round fantastic experience that I wanted to share :)
