So I've been friends with this guy for a while, and we've never had any disagreements until now. His wife posted a picture about frozen and I thought I'd post a link that offered me some perspective on the film, since I disagreed with the image. Unfortunately, it got a little out of hand. Was I too aggressive? Hell, was I downright wrong? Take a look at the image and ensuing debate and let me know.
