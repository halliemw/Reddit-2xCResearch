Story time! I was walking alone, at night, in San Francisco. It was in a pretty good neighborhood, mostly bars frequented by late 20s/early 30s working people. As usual when I walk alone, I was completely lost in my own thoughts, and didn't even notice the car slowing down as it approached me. I was walking in a crosswalk at this point. 

The car had four, maybe five young men in it. As it was ahead of me and slightly to my right, I did not need to turn my head or acknolwedge them in any way in order to watch them. They were making me nervous, of course. Then one of them rolled down the window and, in a voice that carried far too much aggression and vitriol warranted by the situaion, yelled, 

"Get out of the street!!" I didn't move or speed up or physically react in any way. So he tried again, louder, angrier, "Get out of the street, *bitch!!*" I still did not react in any way. I find ignoring loud people is the best way to make them feel small. The car, in response, suddenly sped away in the opposite direction that I was walking.

I have no idea why that happened. The car did not wish to turn, I was not in their way, and even if I was...I was a pedestrian in a crosswalk, I had the right. And why would this person feel the need to try to intimidate me in this fashion? Why was he so angry, so threatened and mean? 

I think...I *think*, that since I was walking confidently and alone, that he felt I needed to be put in my place. Perhaps he knows that women walking alone at night always feel a tad insecure, and are therefore "easy targets". I don't know. This was months ago, and I am still baffled by the actions of those young men. 

I bet we all have stories like this. This one just sticks out to me due to the weirdness of his voice...so *angry*, so venemous!
