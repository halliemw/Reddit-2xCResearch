About a week ago, I was at home with my mom when she asked if I had had sex with my boyfriend. She has asked a few times since I've told her I was dating someone, and I've lied every time but this was the first time I wanted to be truthful, so I was.

Some background; I am a 20 yo I coming from a **very** traditional family with whom I don't share beliefs with. When I moved out she made me promise to stay a virgin until marriage, a promise I never had any intent on keeping. We are not emotionally close, though she believes otherwise. I support myself financially but my parents do try to help out every once in a while.

I called her this week to let her know I have some time to visit this weekend and she tells me she wants to talk. (Talking in my family usually revolves around them telling me what I should do with my life regardless of what I've chosen, I learned early on to just sit and take it) She tells me how disappointed in me she is and how she is losing sleep over it. She then goes on to tell me how a girl's virginity is very valuable, and how I'm basically worthless now that I've given it up. She brought up a bunch of mistakes from my teen years and how the consequences were a divine punishment for not listening to her. This goes on for about an hour.

In recent years, I've developed a complex about speaking my mind, It's something that I've spoken to a counselor about and have been working on, but I still find it really tough to speak up, even when I really want to or think it's necessary. There's a lot I do want to say, I just can't seem to form the words. 

I don't really know what I want to do or say about this situation, let alone, how. 

**tl;dr I came clean about my having sex, but my mom's reaction and way of dealing with it make me wish I wasn't honest with her in the first place**
