It's not that I'm not happy to be pregnant. It was planned, my husband has been fabulously supportive of my crazy cravings and icky morning sickness. 

It's just that I feel like there are so many rules and none of them are going my way. There's a ton of stuff I can't eat/drink because of the chance of listeria, or mercury, or whatever. Yet, I'm pretty sure our parents ate whatever, drank, smoked, etc. and I'm okay, you're ok. Did we really improve outcomes that much that I have to cut ALL these things out for the duration? 

And here's what bugs me the most. I can't get a massage for the first trimester. Ok, fine, whatever. I got assaulted by a patient at work. I'm a nurse, and a confused patient grabbed me by the front of my scrubs with both hands, held me in place and kicked me in the stomach. And my manager and doctor both said the same thing, you will be fine, there's so many things keeping that little one safe that one little kick from an 88 year old lady won't hurt the baby. If you start bleeding, then we'll worry. So, no fun, but getting kicked is ok? I understand, they are trying to calm down a hormonal, crying lady. But I can't help but feel that this is just another double standard for women. It's the same as expecting us to not want sex, because that's dirty, but we have to look sexy and attractive or we aren't worth anything. Now I'm pregnant and I puke constantly, only want to eat certain foods, but can't eat half of what I want, but have to eat something or else I'm hurting the baby. I can't do things that will make me feel good like a massage, but I can get assaulted and be just fine, stop crying.

Grrrrr.

TL;DR: double standards in pregnancy make this hormonally challenged person angry >:-(
