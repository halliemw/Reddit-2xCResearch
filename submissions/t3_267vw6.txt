I've had the implant since February of 2014 (3 months). My sex drive has hit the roof. If I could I would have intercourse every day but I don't which leaves me very frustrated. Also, I have been recieving like three gifts from mother nature, monthly. Does it get better? Will my sex drive go back to normal?
