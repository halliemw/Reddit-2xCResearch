I'm not sure who to ask about this, because my friends harp on him when I ask for advice. A little background: My boyfriend is successful, handsome and kind. He's got a great job, a great apartment just outside the city and we've been dating for just under half a year. I love everything about him, and he's been my saving grace through a rough year at college.

When I first met Jake he was a really, really boisterous guy. Large gestures, large jokes, large laughs - everything. I loved him for that and I was glad to spend time with him because he was like a big light in this little suburb outside the city. He used to make jokes at his own expense when people would be down on themselves and I *always* caught him cheering other people up or offering to help one of his friends. I once saw him drive six hours at the drop of the hat to help his cousin talk out relationship issues with his wife. Not a lot of people noticed when he did stuff like that but I did, and it's really what made me fall in love with him.

But lately I've noticed that he is so hard on himself. Too much. He considers himself short and he's 5'8". He thinks that he's a "smaller guy" but he's more built than anyone I've dated (and he spends more time at the gym than even his "gym" friends). He calls himself stupid for mistakes he's made - stuff that happened over *three years ago* - and I can't help him move on. Sometimes he says he doesn't deserve me and then goes into this odd "confession mode" where we start talking about all the terrible things he did when he wasn't the man he is today. Stuff that I've come to terms with. Stuff that really, he never needed to tell me.

I don't know how to help him. He came from a family where his dad wanted him to be independent and I think relying on me for his emotional support is making it even worse. He talks about living up to his father's expectations and how he wishes he could have done better earlier a **lot**. All he does is worry about doing better but I think that he's doing just fine and I'm worried he won't be happy with what he has.

Everything about him is **great** and I don't know how to explain that to him. He's a great person, has a great job, has a great body and he has **me** and there's no way to get through to him that everything about him is great and he doesn't need to "do better".

What do I do? He saw a psychiatrist when he was younger for drug abuse and it had a negative effect on him. I don't know where to turn when he breaks down and I feel helpless to see the man that I'm in love with crumble in my arms for what sometimes seems like no reason at all.
