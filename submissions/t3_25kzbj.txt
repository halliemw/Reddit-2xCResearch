I used HBC for about 5 years, and then stopped because I was convinced it caused my suicidal depression (doctors said "not a chance!"; I was right). 

2 years ago I got the copper IUD at PP, and I love it! Since coming off HBC, however, I noticed that my hair has gradually thickened and become darker. Cool, except that now, if I don't maintain my face, I start looking like a teenage boy. Suddenly, I have a fuzzy stache, my brows keep trying to hold hands, and my once-solitary chin hair now has more friends than I do! 

And, omigash, the body hair! My leg hair used to be fine, sparse, and short. I could easily get away with not shaving. No more, thanks to inch-long hairs. Arm pits? A jungle. Pubes? I could braid that sh!t. The only upside is the hair on my head is getting longer, and I've been meaning to grow it out.

What's happening to me, 2X? Was the pill suppressing my hairy hormones? Do I eventually become a muppet? Should I worry about PCOS (I've had an ovarian cyst burst 6 months ago, but nothing since)? Is the universe giving me the sweet beard I said I would totally grow were I born XY?
