Hello.
I was wondering if any ladies here have had experience with breast reduction surgeries? Did you have any complications or side effects? Did it help you and your self image etc? Did you regret it? 

I'm 25 and about a DD with rather uneven breasts. It's uncomfortable and difficult to find and wear clothes.  I'm not even sure my insurance will cover it if they deem it's not medically necessary but the thought's been there for awhile.
