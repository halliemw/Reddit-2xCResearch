Hey TwoX,

I'm (21f) looking for a little advice to keep me out of uncomfortable situations that I've got myself into for being... too nice? I think my personality comes off flirty because I'm smiley and chatty with everyone, so it probably comes off as flirty with guys.

I was always under the impression that boys and girls can be friends but it's got to the point where I realized that every friendship I've had with a guy has either turned into a relationship, or the guy has wanted it to turn into a relationship and then it gets awkward. Even when I preface it with "I ONLY WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND AND WANT NOTHING MORE FROM YOU", it still happens.

Do I just avoid friendships with guys? Do I risk coming off as a bitch and be straight up with them from the start? It's a pretty integral part of the way I interact with people in general so I don't want to shut it off, but maybe there are tips or boundaries I can set up? (The problem with setting up boundaries at the beginning of a friendship or whatever is that I feel like I'm being presumptuous and think they'll be into me, so I don't because I give everyone the benefit of the doubt...)

EDIT: Follow up question - is it ever a good idea to try and maintain a friendship with someone when you know they're attracted to you/ want something more?
EDIT 2: Thanks for the advice everyone, very helpful! :)
