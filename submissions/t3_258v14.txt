Has a dude ever come up to you with a baffling, completely insane question about womanlyhood? I'm not talking about generally sexist beliefs that society teaches them, but just general nuttery.

When I was a freshmen in college, a (19-year-old) guy asked me and my friend if women are born with vaginas or if they just... open up one day.

Still gets me rolling to this day just thinking about it.
