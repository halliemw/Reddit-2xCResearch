I am going away on a camping trip for four weeks. There is a chance that I will be at a camp ground with no running water when I get my period.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to handle this. 

Thanks, ladies!

Edit: Thank you everyone for your help! The final verdict is bringing tampons, hand sanitizer, and baby wipes to use and ziploc bags for storage along with discreet bags for throwing them away in the community trashcan.
