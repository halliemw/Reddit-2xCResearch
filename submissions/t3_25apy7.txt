Hey ladies of Reddit,

I'm hoping you can help me win my side of an ongoing disagreement I'm having with my boyfriend. Namely, my boyfriend thinks that if you feel like you have to pee, you should go immediately. He gets annoyed because he says me and previous girlfriends he's had always say they have to pee but then don't go.

First of all, what do you think? Is this a thing? Do women often wait instead of going to the bathroom immediately? And secondly, my theory is that women have to pee more than men, (because we have smaller bladders maybe??) and so to prevent spending *way* too much time on the toilet, we just hold it more often. Does this seem true?

I just want to let my boyfriend know that it's OK if I don't rush to the toilet every time I have the slightest sensation of a partially full bladder.

But I'm open to anything! Let's discuss peeing!
