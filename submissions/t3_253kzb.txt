So, there have been a lot of people coming in here who are ignoring the first rule in the sidebar: Respect. This is a reminder that the only people who can keep this community whole are the members of this community.

When someone posts something inflammatory and/or disrespectful, whether in a comment, a post, or a PM, simply do the following:

* Do NOT respond
* Downvote it
* Report it

Some are going to accuse me of "stifling debate", but it's important to remember that *debate is not what this subreddit is for*. There are other places for that, and you're welcome to go to them. [If that upsets you, this might apply to you](https://xkcd.com/1357/).

Until things calm down a little bit, I'd recommend keeping your comments view on "Best" rather than "New".

EDIT: Thanks for the Gold, kind stranger! The comments here are looking considerably better already. Just a reminder, though - if you're being harassed via PM, it's very important that those be reported as well.
