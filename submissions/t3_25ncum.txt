I just turned 30 last week. I've never been pregnant. 

I was on the Nuvaring for a year or 2 when I was 22-23, but have only been using condoms since then. 

I never really experienced bad period symptoms until I was around 25 or so. Before that, I would have bearable cramps that could be knocked out with a few ibuprofen, very slight moodiness, and fairly medium flow. Around 25, I started getting weepy the week before, and easily angry. The first night of my period, I'm usually woken up with cramps, take a couple Pamprin, then back to bed. The first day is usually fairly uncomfortable, but I remembered how easy my periods were when I was on Nuvaring. Since its now covered under my insurance, I stated it almost a month ago. 

I took it out Sunday, and I've had some spotting, nothing serious. And I thought "AWESOME this is a piece of cake!" Last night, I had some twinges of cramps, but went back to sleep. I got up this morning and was a little uncomfortable, so I took a Pamprin. I went to work, felt really uncomfortable, took a Pamprin, went to the bathroom and SO MUCH BLOOD. Not just that, but stabbing pain and huge clots like I've never seen. I literally would have thought I was having a miscarriage if that were a possibility. 

I talked to my sister, and she said the same thing happened to her on Mirena the first couple of months and then it evened out as her body got used to the hormones. Anyone else have something similar happen? I left work early, I was dizzy, nauseous, and so sore. I'm feeling better now but I really don't want to do this every time I remove the ring. 

Edit: what the hell is up with the practically equal up and down votes on every post? I'm guessing it's due to being on Default? That's really discouraging.
