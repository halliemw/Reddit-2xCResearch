Seriously, why do I need to feel pressured to wear one of these awful impractical garments? Can't swim in it, have to constantly adjust it no matter how well it fits, oscillate between "Rawr own that body!" and "ooooh no be ashamed you've had two kids and it shows!"  

FUCK. THAT. SHIT. 

I love the beach. I love to swim. I will wear whatever facilitates that best.
