Over the last three days I have been repeatedly followed by multiple instagram users who post inappropriate comments such as "gargle my balls" and "i hope you crash and die". At first I thought it was just some stupid high schooler (I recently finished a semester of student teaching) but they have continued to create new accounts and post new comments before I am able to block whoever it is. So I filed a report with the campus police this afternoon. 

I don't really think there's a point to this, I just didn't want to post on facebook for my friends and family to see. I'm so frustrated and I hope it gets taken care of soon and doesn't spread to other social media.
