So, my FMIL and FSIL were trying to convince me to take bridal photos and, like the title says, my FMIL told me "You've very pretty, but you should wear more makeup." My wonderful finace overheard and immediately was like, "Hey, newfarmgirl, come play with the dogs outside with me!" and we escaped. 

We confronted her about it later and she clarified that "well, i think everyone looks better with makeup. I just meant I'd like to see you in it, I'd like to play with makeup on your face." Which, in my opinion, is hardly any better. I know she didn't mean it meanly, because she doesn't have a mean bone in her body (just many, many oblivious ones) but I feel like, as a woman, you should instinctively, intuitively KNOW that any sentence that starts with "You're very pretty, but..." just CAN NOT end well. 

I consider myself a fairly confident person, and while I've never been *completely* happy with my looks, I'm contentedly positive about them. But now...I can't get her words out of my head. I made myself physically ill just thinking about it today. I alternate between wanting to buy a Sephora store and wanting to drink an entire bottle of wine. Please help me stop overreacting, or at least feel better?
