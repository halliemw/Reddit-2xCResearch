Recently started dating this awesome guy, who happens to have an awesome kid and an ex wife. There's been a little stuff here and there with his ex but nothing that's had a major impact on anything-yet. It's like as soon as something is resolved, I feel this huge wave of relief only to realize that this isn't something that's going away, ever. I've never dated someone who was previously married, let alone has a child. It's all very weird and strange for me and I just want some outside perspective on the different ways to deal with it. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated! I don't want this to negatively affect our budding romance as just about every other aspect of the relationship is awesome so far. Also, if any males happen to stumble upon this, any words of wisdom you might have to contribute are also appreciated!
