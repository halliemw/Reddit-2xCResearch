I was hoping some of you lovely ladies could help me out a bit. I just got Nexplanon a few months ago (hooray!) and consequently have much lighter and less frequent periods. Unfortunately I'm stuck between "too heavy for a pantiliner" but "not enough for a regular absorbency tampon", so I use the light ones. The problem is that most companies only offer light tampons as a multi-pack with regular and super, which I really don't need. I don't want to be buying tampons, only to use 8 of them and throw out the rest. Does anyone know if there are manufacturers that offer light-only boxes? 

I guess I should also add that I'm not really interested in a Diva Cup/Moon Cup type thing. Since I'll have periods so infrequently, I don't think it's very cost-effective for me at this point (poor college student...).

Thanks!
