I finally decided to talk to my Nurse Practitioner about terrible neck aches I have been getting for years. About two years ago, I told a different NP about my neck pain and her response was "Just be glad you don't have chronic pain that affects you daily" and rather snidely said she could refer me to a physical therapist. After that, I just decided to deal with it until this past month where the pain became a weekly thing. My new NP actually asked me questions about my pain and finally told me that I suffer from tension headaches. She gave me stronger pain-killers and some muscle relaxers as well as suggesting ways for me to reduce stress and loosen my muscles. I'm so relieved that she took my pain seriously and am really frustrated with the other NP who just brushed off my concerns. Has anyone else had similar experiences? What do you do about a medical professional who won't take you seriously?
