I am currently single and when I get to the point of being too horny, I will call upon one of my FWB. However, I almost immediately regret it and feel like I was being used, even though I am essentially "using" the other person to fulfill my needs. 

How can I enjoy unattached sex without letting my emotional side take over and make me feel guilty?
