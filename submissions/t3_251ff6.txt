I know a lot of people are freaking out, but can we give the mods the benefit of the doubt?  I think they’ve earned it.  Their hard work and diligence was a large part of turning TwoX into what the regulars know and love.  It’s not like they all plan to go on vacation and throw the sub to the wolves.  They realize there will be extra work for them now that this is a default sub.  I’m sure if it proves too much, they will get TwoX removed from the default list.  

Sure, there will be some growing pains.  I’ve seen a lot of people worrying about RedPill users coming to troll, but it’s not like they didn’t already know about TwoX.  Ironically (or perhaps not since I don’t know what irony is anymore, damn you Alanis!), I only know of RedPill from hearing about it on TwoX.  Having multiple top posts in r/all asking how to remove TwoX from default is just going to encourage trolls.  Also, downvoting into oblivion will also encourage trolls.  There’s no perfect solution, I suggest keeping troll comments and posts to 0 votes and reporting to the mods.  They’ve always done a good job removing those.  When trolls aren’t fed, they move on.

And lastly, you don’t have to ask everyone about related subunits.  There’s been a list of them in the sidebar for as long as I remember.
