Hey 2X. 19 year old female here! :)
I don't really have anyone I could really talk to this about, and you guys seem to be a pretty awesome and supportive community.

About a year ago I started taking Wellbutrin for depression after a (second) bad run with Lexapro. I've had some pretty fantastic results with it when it comes to my depression (still some bad days but they're far and few between) but shortly after I started taking it I started dropping weight. I started out somewhere between 118 to 123lbs (5'1") and dropped to around 98 which is somewhere around the lower end of a healthy bmi for my height/age, but it's still dropping.

Shit gets serious when your boobies start to deflate, ladies. I returned to a healthier weight after going off meds for a couple of months, but my depression got considerably worse. One hundred and fifteen pounds is a normal, healthy weight, and the reasonable part of my brain knows that, but fitting snugly into what had been my baggy, stay at home jeans for the past six months made me want to cry. 

I know it's probably pretty fucked up and unhealthy, but I still have that voice in the back of my head when I look in the mirror or see myself on cam (camgirl) saying how my legs could be a little slimmer or my stomach could be flatter. It's some body dysmorphic shit and I know it, but I can't silence it either. 

My boyfriend mentioned an eating disorder last night when we were talking. After thinking on it I'm kind of afraid that he could be right and I'm heading in that direction. I stress about my weight a lot, and with work I'm certainly in a position where there are plenty of opportunities to over analyze. 

However, the thought of changing meds after finally finding something that works is a nightmare, and doesn't really solve the underlying problem.

Any thoughts or suggestions on coming to terms with the squishy bits?
