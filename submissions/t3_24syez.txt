I want to get a cup, and was so excited to give it a try with Softcups, the disposable kind.  

I HATE them.  

They leak like crazy; it's barely better than wearing nothing at all. I've had a kid, which I think means you need a larger cup than you would otherwise, but I think the softcups might be too big. I can feel the rim jutting out past the pubic bone, even when it's as far in as it will go.  

Am I just not built for cups? Should I find a smaller one, even though I've already had a baby? Any recommendations on brands or sizes would be appreciated! I still would really like to find something that's as worry-free and sustainable as everyone says cups are, but Softcup was a miserable failure for me.
