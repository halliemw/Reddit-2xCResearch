There is a similar post on the front page.
But this is directed towards everyone.

It's been one week since TwoX became a default. There has been time for things to die down and settle into the new normal.

I would love to hear everyone's opinions. I mean everyone.

Old users?

New users?

Trolls?

As a Man?

Men who were on it before it became a default?

Mods?

**Anyone who is subscribed should have a chance to have their say.**




Pros and Cons?

Has TwoX gotten better or worse?

Do you think it will become better in time?

How many months/years will it be before the mods post an actual response to our questions?

Do you think the original users desire to have a safe space, and relevant discussion like they used to have should trump the exciting new opportunities to educate the men of reddit on whether sexism actually exists?

**Should TwoXChromosomes remain a default?**

I would love to hear all responses. Positive, negative, everyone.
Please don't downvote anyone, simply because you disagree with them, this is place for discussion for everyone. If it pops up on your front page, you should be able to give your opinion on it in this thread.

Let's have a revote on [this poll](http://goo.gl/9WrK8c)!
