I hope this is okay to ask here :3 I need a deodorant that works more towards odor control than a perspirant. I don't sweat a lot but I'm always paranoid that my underarms smell, and the one I'm using (secret's 48 hour odor control) doesn't seem to be working for me too well. It's hard to find anything that is more odor control rather than a perspirant, any ideas would be appreciated!
