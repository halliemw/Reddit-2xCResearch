I have posted something similar to r/femalehairadvice, but I like you guys so I'd love your opinion too...

Thanksgiving of 2011 I had a very unfortunate asymmetrical haircut, and since then I have not had a haircut outside of a trim.  This is what it looks like this morning, following going to bed with wet hair and throwing it up in a ponytail with my side bangs in a clip (took them out of the clip for this picture). http://imgur.com/PWh6UkC

I love the way long hair looks, but I'm beginning to think I'm just not cut out for it.  Do you guys think I should cut it? I'm just afraid of hating it again and waiting another 2 years for longer hair.  I don't even know what cut would look good on me.  (I can provide more pictures.) I don't want to be a pansy-pants but I also don't want to hate my hair.  HALP.
