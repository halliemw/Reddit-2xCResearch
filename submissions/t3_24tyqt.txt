Needless to say I NEVER want to see this scumbag again!! 

not only did I find boyfriend with a hooker, I ended up giving the hooker a ride back downtown because I felt bad her stumbling around the neighborhood. Its not her fault she is more of victim in my mind, you don't work in the sex trade, look noticeably like a "hooker" and could be living the best life.  The sex worker gave me half the money he paid her ( I refused, but she left the cash in my car anyways)  she "disclosed" to me  that she was a "hooker" and much more than I  ever want to know about her and her time with my boyfriend.  Anyways..This has been a two year emotional abusive relationship, which I kept going back to. Catching him a hooker has been the best thing as I feel free from him and I'm gaining more friends and supports over the last few days than I had in the last two years!!  I'm not sure if I will trust anyone the same again however I no plans on dating, waiting on STi/STD results and I will need to be retested over the next 6 month. My friend has got me in touch with a counseling group for women.  I just wanted to share my story as I just home from being tested and having dinner with friends, but I'm finding it hard to deal with tonight. 

UPDATE: THANK YOU ALL!!! all test came back NEGATIVE!!!  YAY!!!
