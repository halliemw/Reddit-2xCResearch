Ladies, I need your opinions/advice/experiences. My boyfriend of over a year never asks me to go out with his friends (to have dinner, hang out in the city, etc) and I feel a little hurt by it. I would understand if it's just his man friends and they're going out drinking and they want to be alone. But he never invites me to events where his man friends invite their girlfriends. Am I justified in feeling upset here?

What are your experiences like with your boyfriends?
