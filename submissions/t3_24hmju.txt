I'm in university and my housemate of this year is moving out to be with her boyfriend of 1 year, and basically told me what they were going to do.

 Back in December he told her that they were moving in together and I wasn't told until January, later we decided that I would move in with them too so the rent would be cheaper. That changed without my knowledge in about March. Then today they told me that he was taking the router. I'm in the middle of exams and they are just taking the internet away. Again they didn't ask me they just told me. 

So I tried to talk with my housemate about it but she wouldn't listen to me and kept interrupting and I yelled at her, which I understand I shouldn't have done. I just don't know what to do.

I feel like my opinion doesn't matter and that her boyfriend is all that matters. What makes things worse is that he stayed over a lot and doesn't pay rent and still is treated like he is the only thing that matters.
