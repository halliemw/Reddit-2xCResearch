Warning: This is a pretty unexciting update.  
Well, it's been almost month since I told him not to contact me... At first it seemed to work, and a few weeks later he sent me an "I'm sorry for what happened." Which I ignored, because I didn't want to open up room for any conversation.  
And then, right after the semester ended, he started up again, messaging me more and more frequently, which I continued to ignore.  
And then I realized: now that the semester is over, I don't have to work with him anymore... so I blocked him. :)
