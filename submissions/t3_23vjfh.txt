Hey everyone!  So I am on Seasonique (a $200 birth control) and I am looking for alternatives on how to knock down the price.  The price used to not be a problem at all, because my GYN used to give me free samples all the time before it went generic.  But now that there is a generic, I have been bumming money off my parents to cover the price of this medication because my insurance, Viva Health, does not cover it. I specifically need Seasonique for medical reasons to suppress my endometriosis.  Should I switch insurances?  What do I do?
