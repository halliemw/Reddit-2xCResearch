Hi there.  (Throwaway primarily because I don't want to deal with trolls today.)  I had my Mirena implanted about two months ago.  I'm still really glad that I got it done, but I have a few questions for those who have been on it longer than I have about your periods after you had the Mirena implant.

I know that not all women will have the lighter or non-existent period side-effect.  However, I've noticed that my periods have a much longer length than they did both on an oral contraceptive and pre-birth control.  (Granted, I've been on oral contraceptives for the last six years before switching to Mirena.)

I've seen some women talk about how they had a few heavier periods before their bodies adjusted, but I'm curious how long that lasted.  I essentially want to know if I should expect my periods to continue to have a longer duration or if that is something that may change over the next few months.  

**tl;dr** How did your periods change over time when you had the Mirena implant?
