So I (15) recently got my first thong underwear, and they weren't quite what I was expecting. I had always thought that the string rested on the crack and would be visible in a standing position. However, no matter which thong I try the string gets "swallowed" and is in direct contact with my anus. I had been told to expect the dreaded "wedgie" feeling, but instead what I feel is pressure specifically on my butthole, especially when sitting down or walking. I'm not sure if this is the norm, or if my butt is just made weird or what. So I guess my questions are should I be able to see the string of my thong, and should I be experiencing this kind of sensation?

Thanks 2x, you girls rock! (Also throwaway for obvi reasons)
