I can't possibly be the only one who just has no interest in long term (romantic) relationships?  It's not a matter of "not meeting the right guy" - I've met plenty, gone through the same old song and dance, and I just never want to be tied down romantically to someone for the rest of my life.  I am happy and complete on my own, but I feel like this is so looked down upon by everybody I've ever met.  It's really tiring being treated like an immature child just because I'm more interested in my career and investing in my own hobbies.

I don't know, I guess I am just looking for some sort of assurance that other people have the same/similar mindset.  It's not that I hate romance, I just don't want to participate in it and all the more power to people who can personally invest themselves in that sort of thing!  I respect that, but it'd be nice to have the reverse too :(
