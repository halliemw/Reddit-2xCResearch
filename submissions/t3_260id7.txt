After almost ten years of doing squat, I (25) have recently taken up running/jogging for about an hour three times a week. I'm loving it so far, and this is largely due to *finally* finding a sports bra that can tame my 40E jugs. The only problem is that about 40 minutes into my workout, my nipples start hurting like I dipped them into ice water for too long. I'm suspecting that this is due to the fact that I got my nipples pierced in my ten sports-bra-less years, and that the segment rings, combined with the ultra-tight sports bra (a wireless bustier-type thing, if it makes any difference), are somehow cutting off circulation. 

So I'm wondering, fellow busty Sporty Spices of 2XC -- are tender/hurting nipples normal for large boobs? Could there be other factors at work? Or am I going to have to choose between my piercings and my running?
