...and it's really putting a dent in my mental health.

I'm a very sexual person, sarcastically or not. My major (engineering) is basically all men except me so I'm pretty good with the sexual innuendos and laughing at penis jokes. I'm not discriminated socially at all; the guys accept me as an honorary guy and things just go swimmingly in public.

In private, I'm also very sexual. I enjoy masturbating and having sex (monogamously). I've never had sex with a guy I'm not dating, nor have I kissed or hold hands or flirted with anyone I'm not dating. Not that it's bad, it's just the guilt I feel when I get horny around males. Just recently I broke up with a guy and now I feel guilty when I hang out with anyone. I think everyone's attractive and I get aroused easily. It just happens, especially when sexual jokes are thrown around 24/7.

I like sex, I like masturbating. I like pornos of all sorts. It's just when I start to think about anyone sexually, I'm overridden with guilt. Enough so that I don't want to hang out with that guy or even look at him. I don't want to be a whore, but I sort of am, aren't I? I think about it often enough and isn't thinking half the doing? I think sex is good, and if I know the guy well and we're both into each other I don't see why we shouldn't have sex. So why do I feel guilty thinking about these things? How do I stop it? Should I be guilty about it?

Ladies, please help me out here. I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling guilty about sex, but how can I deal with it? Is it bad or good to have? Should I be having sex with anyone or should I only have sex with one guy that I'm serious about? I mean, it is college so shouldn't I have a bit of fun? Or is that uncouth? So much conflict!

Edit: I should mention that the trigger note in the title was meant for a rape story I was going to tell, but I think what I wrote above is sufficient. I've only had one bad incident and things have been resolved.
