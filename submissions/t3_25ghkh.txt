How are you ladies so trusting of your birth control? I've considered switching loads, but I just can't get over the millions of "what ifs" I keep coming up with.

I'm a condom-only girl precisely because I can see exactly when it's failed and can take steps to deal within hours (I know the emergency pill isn't 100%, but it's a step you can take, y'know?). I know most birth control has 97-99% success rate, so theoretically I'd be fine, but if it failed you wouldn't realise until you were into abortion territory (if you even noticed that early - what do you do if you have a "silent" pregnancy with a BC that stops periods and don't realise until you're out of the legal termination window? Or am I being crazy?). My boyfriend mentioned years ago that he'd like to go without a condom just to see what it's like, and when I explained why I wasn't keen he said it made sense and hasn't asked since. We've had a couple of failed condoms, but a morning-after pill later and it's all good (though I was shitting myself a little until my period started). I kind of want to be trusting enough to go for it so he gets the full effects of sex, but... eep...

Have any of you ladies ever had similar doubts/worries about your birth control? And if so, how did you get over it to the point of "the thing's in my arm now so I don't have to worry"? I'd be constantly peeing on sticks if I was on the pill/implant/etc., I'm jealous of anyone who can be that relaxed about it.

Also: my boyfriend's in the army, so I'm not even getting that much sex. I just worry about getting pregnant a seriously disproportionate amount...
