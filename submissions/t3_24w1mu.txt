Ladies, I'm using a throwaway because I'm ashamed, embarrassed and confused. I've been a long-time lurker, upvoter and occasional contributor to this subreddit. This is one of the comfier subreddits out there and I feel like I can get some good input here. 

I have a pretty charmed life. I've worked hard and lucked out and have ended up with, what seems like a "perfect life," at least on paper. This isn't meant as a brag but I'm 26 and so far I've got the following going for me:

* Great job with good salary, benefits, bonuses, perks, 401k, etc 
* Work for a top Fortune 500 technology company (think shiny silver...fruit)
* Fantastic team and manager & interesting and challenging responsibilities and opportunities  
* I own my own home in a desirable area with great amenities & schools
* Engaged to a wonderful man who I adore and we are excited to start our lives together and start a family
* Supportive families (both our parents still together, etc)
* Traveled the world plenty in my youth, through college & after
* Significant savings & trust fund 

I'm really struggling because I feel extremely unfulfilled with my life. I have everything that anyone could seemingly want and yet it isn't making me happy or fulfilled. I struggle with dealing with these feelings and then I feel awful about myself because there are so many out there that would kill for a chance at what I have... and I think it isn't good enough? What is wrong with me? 

I don't know what it is that I want, and I don't know how to feel fulfilled in my life. But I do know that whatever I'm doing now isn't cutting it. I'm in therapy (for anxiety and just because) but it isn't really helping. I tried anti-depressants but that just made everything worse. I think I'm just in the throes of a quarter-life crisis and I'm not handling it well. 

I don't even know if I'm looking for advice here or maybe it's just a misery loves company thing. But thanks for reading anyway. 

**TL;DR I have "everything" and it means nothing to me**
