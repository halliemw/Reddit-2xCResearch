I've been traveling around Central America for a couple weeks and I've been taking Doxycycline as an anti-malarial. Of course it gave me an awful yeast infection and I didn't think to bring anything for one. I can't seem to find any yeast infection treatment down here (I'm in Panajachel, Guatemala right now) and my Spanish isn't great. My boyfriend's brother is the only one of us who can communicate well and obviously I don't want to ask him to walk around asking people about yeast infections. Monistat has never really worked for me in the past, but if that's the only thing available down here I'm desperate enough to try it. Can anyone tell me some over the counter medication that might be available here?
