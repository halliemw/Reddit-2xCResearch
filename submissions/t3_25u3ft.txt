Hey everyone,

I don't really know why I'm posting this but I've been crying all day about my skin. I haven't struggled with acne for the past 5 years. When I did struggle, it was BAD. 

I went on the pill to help with migraines and it seemed to, so I stayed on it. It had the added benefit of clearing my skin which was great. 

After a few years, and many different brands of the pill, I decided to go off it to normalize my moods, deal with my depression and just be prescription free to see how my mind and body function in their normal state. 

Everything was great. I was less moody, happier, less irritable, I lost weight and for the first 4 months my skin didn't change much.

Until two weeks ago, when it exploded (not literally). Pimples everywhere. Big ones, little ones. Overall texture was just bumpy and awful. 

Before anyone plugs skincareaddiction, I used to work for a major cosmetic retailer as. a full time skin consultant so I know my skin care. This is not the kind of acne that a great skincare routine can fix (I've tried). I have a GREAT skincare routine, but it won't touch hormonal acne very much. 

I'm frustrated. Very much so. My moods are better but depression is taking a hold because I hate my face again. I barely want to leave my house anymore because I feel disgusting. 

I refilled my old prescription for the pill today and im just staring at the box wondering if I should do it again. It's the lesser of two evils at this point but if I wait it out will my hormones balance and my skin go back to how it was even last month? I just don't know..

Has anyone had this kind of experience?

Edit: this got gilded? Really?! Thanks!! But I'm not sure why hahaha.
As for the down vote brigade, I shake my fist at you sad sacks of shit
