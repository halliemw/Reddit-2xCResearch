My husband and I are drinking together getting pretty drunk. I am madly in love with him. He is my first real love. I say "let's think of a word higher than love for how I feel about you" he says "we've had this discussion before. We came up with 'labove.'" Problem is I have absolutely NO RECOLLECTION of this!  I am very upset that he is confusing a heartfelt sentiment with another girl from a previous relationship.  He thinks I am just nuts and not remembering what he is remembering.  We drink together quite often but I am almost absolutely certain I have Never said this before! I don't. Ugh. Know. For sure.
