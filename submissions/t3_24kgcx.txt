I'm on my last pack and I can't get more birth control pills until my doctor checks up on me. Meanwhile, my period week is not that far off and my appointment is on the last week of the month. So that's about a week and a half or 2 of not being on the pill (or longer, I don't know when I'm actually going to get more). What's going to happen to my body during that time? Will my periods be irregular until I get back on the pill?
