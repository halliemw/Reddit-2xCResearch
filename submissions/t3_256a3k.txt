I plan to go over the top satirical with it but so far I have:

* using fake blood as opposed to that random blue liquid
* a woman asking another woman to check behind her if she's bleeding (am I the only one that does that /is always paranoid?)
* going through a pile of white pants and determining you can't wear any of them because real women don't wear white on their periods (in contrast to every tampon commercial anyway).

I have a few other ones, but this is kind of a contest so I'm too paranoid to post them all. Thanks!

**Any other ideas??**

PS I'm primarily a pad wearer, but tampon wearers **(1) Do you worry about bleed-through? (2) Do you wear tampons on their own or with a pad or with a liner?**

Edit: Jesus why is this being downvoted? Is it because I'm talking about periods? PERIOD. MENSTRUATION. TAMPON. VAGINA.
