I tried posting this in AskReddit a few weeks ago and hardly anyone responded, and after discovering this sub I feel like this is definitely the audience I was trying to reach.

I'm newly single after a 4-year relationship and am having a hugely difficult time doing the single thing. I really have any close friends, so I've tried going out by myself and it hasn't been successful at all. I know I should give myself an adjustment period, but I feel so lonely in every way even after a month and a half.

So, women of reddit, tell me what you do with your time when you're single. How do you adjust into single-ness, and how to you get comfortable with it?
