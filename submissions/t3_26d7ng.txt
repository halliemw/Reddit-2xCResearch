I've lived with my SO for a few years now, we moved across the country together and have a generally great, loving relationship.

However, ever since we moved in, I can't sleep without him.

I generally consider myself independent, feminist, etc, would do just fine without a man, etc, but it's really late for me and I am tired and upset because my man is out.

When he's going away for a while, it's no problem- I just make an effort to have an extra relaxing evening before going to bed. And when I go away without him, I generally have no problem getting to sleep on my own anywhere outside of our home.

The problem comes in with spontaneous nights out. Tonight we were with friends, and some of our group split off. I was feeing a little unwell and decided to use the opportunity to head home and get to bed early, he was going to go on to the next bar. I had in my head that it would only be an hour or so; it's about four hours later now. He's posting on social media about how much fun he's having with his friend. 

I feel like it's too late at night and I'm too tired to control my emotions. I'm PISSED at him for leaving me alone in this insomnia. It feels like I'm paying the price for his night out (I never sleep in and physically can't, so I will feel awful tomorrow) without any of the fun. At the same time, though, it feels like I don't have the right to ask him to give up going out with friends at night. I'm a homebody and it's not his fault that my nervous system is screwed up like this.

Am I the only one dealing with this? What's wrong with me? What conversations should I be having with him about this?
