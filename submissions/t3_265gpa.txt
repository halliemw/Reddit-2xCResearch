Okay ladies, I'm sure this is an incredibly naive question, but I've never done this before. 
I'm asking this in TwoX since you ladies are probably most familiar with any concerns I might have about safety precautions.

I've got a summer internship at a major (yet rural) university and I found out last summer by experience that parking on campus was EXPENSIVE. So I plan to rent nearby (instead of 15 minutes out by car) and walk or ride the bus. My PI suggested I check craigslist, but **I honestly don't know how to gauge the safety of an offer or avoid crazy roommates and all that.** I'd only be there for about 2 months so renting a dorm room is absurdly expensive and awful sounding, but I'm a small [22F] and fairly naive so I don't want to take any risks. 

TL;DR: What factors do YOU use to gauge the safety of a craigslist offer around a university campus, and what are some red flags to look out for?
