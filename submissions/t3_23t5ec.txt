Sorry if this is stupid! 
Ok, to keep it simple, I'm 24 & have been sexually active since I was 16. I had one long term partner but the sex was always focused on him. I enjoyed it but never felt like I even came close to cuming with him.

My new partner (been together 7 months) is more focused on me. We have a good sex life (2-3 times a week minimum), and he usually tries to get me off but can't. 

We decided to play with a toy and got a bullet vibrator to use on me. Now, from my knowledge (and I like to think I would know), I have never cum before. This one night however, he played with me with the bullet until I was practically convulsing. I couldn't control my body and in the end I think I might have cum. I was so exhausted after the feeling, however it almost felt like I peed a little. 

Is this normal? How can I tell if I did cum? I was thinking from the way that I went from tense & convulsing to utterly exhausted that I did?
