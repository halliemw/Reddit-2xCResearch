I've seen a lot of people complain that this Subreddit doesn't deserve to be a default. Both men and women have complained that this subreddit isn't default material. To the new users that found this subreddit because it became default, Congratulations! You're welcome here. All new users should be welcomed here! Still, in my opinion, this subreddit is too personal and niche to be a default. This subreddit is a support group. I feel the majority of users here agree with me, but I may be wrong, which is why I made a poll to settle things.

The mods remain on their stance that it will all pass and things will be back to normal. It's been two weeks. It hasn't passed. It won't pass. 

We have to do something in order to get the mods or Reddit admins attention that we don't like this place defaulted. Please vote in this poll if you agree with me. Share your opinion, even if you disagree with my stance, by voting on this poll. Maybe they would get a clear answer and finally listen to us.
