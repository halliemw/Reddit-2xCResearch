This weekend I am finally moving out of my parents house ! 
I'm going from a giant 2300 square foot home with my family to 160 square foot bachelor basement apartment, and I couldn't be more excited ! 

Since having my son in July 2013, I have been struggling to make ends meet even living at my parents; I had to go back to work when he was only 6 months old, instead of the typical 1 year maternity leave. I have finally sorted things out financially, and we are ready to be out on our own! I'm so excited to have my own space and freedom, and had to share with you all!
