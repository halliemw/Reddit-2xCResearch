Hi everyone. I've had a paragard for 3 years. I wonder if this is related or not. My question is as follows:

I keep getting infections. For the past 4 months, every month before my period I get a yeast infection or BV. Usually they go away when my period starts, but not this time. I'm actually itching *inside* (Also outside). It burns when I pee & I itch continuously.  

I also have begun to spot before & after my periods. Last month my period was 2 weeks late (it came the day after my husband came home from the oilfield, haha whoops), which I chalked up to stress. It started right after we DTD.  I had a really light (for me) period, but it lasted *12 days* (So no more fun times & then he had to leave again!). I use a Diva Cup & that's practically unheard of for me (I usually can't leave the house the first two days). 

A year ago when I got my pap the iud had migrated to the side (not sure why). The strings are so short I have never been able to reach them. When I went to the dr they brushed off my concerns & said it was just the iud adjusting. Since it is non- hormonal & it's been 3 years, shouldn't my body have adjusted by now? 

I am also very allergic to nickel (I break out & get a weeping itchy rash from copper plated nickel, silver plated nickel, etc). I know that the paragard has a nickel core (just a tiny amount). Could I have developed an allergy to my iud? 

I am not averse to getting it out, it's just really expensive w/o insurance. 

Note: I am not eating processed sugary foods & am eating a "keto" diet (basically very low carb paleo).

**Tl;dr: period is wonky, constant infections, is it paragard or who knows what**
