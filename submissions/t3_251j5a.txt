I'm really sorry if this is the wrong place, I just honestly have no idea where to go with this sort of thing.

I'm really worried about one of my friends. I've talked to one of our mutual friends about this, and he's equally as worried. She's dating this guy, and he just seems really *off* to us.

She's 15, really pretty, really impressionable, a bit.. I don't know, I wouldn't say naive, but she's had some shitty boyfriends in the past and has some trust issues, so she tends to look straight past the bad in people and just get attached to them, if that makes any sense.

He's always calling her princess, comparing her to goddesses, and just generally being a bit of a try hard. If I'm understanding it right, they also started dating while he was also dating somebody else, which is when all this princess stuff started.

The way he talks to her is like something out of one of Shakespeare's plays, she gets all giddy and googly eyed whenever he's like that, and it just seems really odd.

The first time we heard anything about him was when he was calling her a goddess, saying that she was more than that, it just screamed player to us. There's a huge timezone difference between them, she's in the US and he's in Norway (I think? Somewhere around there) so they really only talk through texts/Skype, she said that he's "busy" for weeks on end and is barely around, too.

Are we being too paranoid? Like I said, she's had some shitty boyfriends, and we really don't want her to get hurt again. I've mentioned it to her, and she went on about how he was perfect, how he was different from other guys, that sort of thing.
