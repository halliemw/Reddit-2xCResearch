So, I've posted here before saying I'm afraid of sex and intimacy, and that my BF and I have difficulty engaging in each other's hobbies.  Well, we're fixing that latter part, but the first part is still up in the air.

We were discussing a few days ago what we think marriage should be.  He was baffled and disgusted by what I had to say.  He kept telling me it was so wrong and horrible.

Here's what I had to say:

"I don't believe in premarital sex (he knows this, we've agreed on it).  So sex would be primarily for procreation (that's how I've been raised, it's a cultural thing that I firmly believe in).  If my husband asked, I'd agree.  I want to be a good wife, part of that is meeting his sexual needs.  I'd lie down, spread my legs, and let him do what he will.  If I don't satisfy him, I'd offer an open relationship.  He should be able to fulfill his desires to any extent, as long as he doesn't hurt me or anyone else.  This is because I love him and want him to be happy.  Marriage is about give and take.  I'll give him my body, he'll give me happiness and companionship.  (I mean, men get married for free sex, right?  Let's not kid ourselves here).  I wouldn't care much for foreplay or any of that after marriage, it's not about me.  Men don't need that to enjoy themselves, why should I?  Other than sex, our relationship would be fun, loving, affectionate, intellectually stimulating, supportive, etc."

He kept going on about how awful that worldview is and kept going on about love and intimacy and mutual pleasure.  I told him to cut the crap.  I know how much he wants sex, I know all of this is BS to cajole women.  He was very hurt.

Is what I believe so wrong and perverse?  Is it bad that I want my marriage to be this way?  I'd like the perspective of fellow women.  Thanks!
