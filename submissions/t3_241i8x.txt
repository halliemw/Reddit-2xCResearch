First off, I'd like to say that this is going to be really confusing. I don't know where else to post this but since you ladies are really intelligent I thought you could help me. 

We have been dating for 16 months, I'm 18 and he's 17. I do love him a lot and that's why I need to fix this. 

It's starting to seem like it's all in my head.. Everything that I *think* he does, or I *think* he lies about since I haven't found actual proof. However, with that being said, I still get very upset to the point where I have thought of suicide (that's a whole different problem I need to fix).

I think he does a variety of things that I fear, such as flirting with girls, cheating, to name a few. However, as stated before, I don't have evidence but I **still** feel like he does this and I don't know why. There are points in time where I know he doesn't and I'm confident in our relationship, and then there are points in time where I think I *know* he does what I fear. It constantly changes from those two thoughts. 

I get really sad all the time thinking about the stuff I think I *know* he does and as of the last 5-6 months, I've been continually in a "fog" of sadness or something. All we do is fight, I'm guessing because of me, and I want it to stop but I don't know how. 

I accuse him constantly of doing things. There is no end to it. At that time, sometimes it lasts more than a few days, I believe that he does what I have accused him of doing (without no **real** evidence- just the stuff I come up with) and I begin to sort of hate him. I've done this countless times in our relationship. When I do accuse him and we get into arguments, I break up with him and I get into this sort of phase where I say terrible things to him- that I know if someone said to me, I'd be devastated, so I know how he feels- and I'm fully aware of it. It takes me a while to cool down and after that I regret everything. He forgives me because he feels like we can eventually be happy together, which I want to. I want to stop this, I don't wan to do this anymore and I want to treat him right because he deserves it, not the way I have been treating him. He has so much hope for our future whereas I don't. He sticks by me and supports me because he loves me so much and wants me to be happy. He has done so much for me whereas I have not.

I want to fix this twox, but I don't know how. So please help me. Any advice is appreciated. 

Side note, I can't afford a therapist, I'm currently living in a women's shelter (another different story). 

Thank you for reading.
