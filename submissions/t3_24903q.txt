After much research and thought (and lurking on this subreddit) I decided to get the Mirena. So I brought it up with my doctor on my physical, and she wrote the prescription. "Oh, by the way, it's pretty expensive" she says. I knew that, but had only heard stories from the US, so wasn't sure what to expect here (Canada). I ask how much, and she says "it can be $400 or $500.", Oh, wow. Then she says "Get it at Costco, I think it's $350 there, and that's definitely the cheapest." I don't have a Costco membership. But! I learn, from her, you DON'T need to be a Costco member to use the pharmacy! You just walk in and instead of showing a membership tell them you're going to the pharmacy. It's so cool! Meds there are cheaper than other drugstores, the dispensing fee (or whatever it's called?) is less than 50% most pharmacies. 

And today, I learn, the pharmacists there are WAY more competent than any other I've dealt with. I have medical coverage through my work, and my SO has coverage for me through his work, but no other pharmacy has known how to put both through (they just give us the receipt and tell us to send it in to the second insurer. Which isn't always worth it, if the prescription didn't cost too much.) So the pharmacist scans the Mirena. $0.00. She scans some migraine medication. $0.00. She scans my antibiotics. $0.00 (the other prescriptions are unrelated to the Mirena, just they were all on the same page). I'm shocked and elated. I just got over $400 worth of prescriptions FOR FREE. I'll have birth control for FIVE YEARS for FREE. 

I was so excited, I had to tell someone. And my friends and family aren't really the type to want to know about this. And it was many of you ladies who helped me make this decision, so I figured I'd share here. Cheers :)
