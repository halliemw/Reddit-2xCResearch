I'm going to be a junior in college, I just finished up my sophomore year. In high school, my cumulative GPA was a 3.3. I did well my last two years but my first two years I screwed up, so I refused to let that happen in college. My first semester was my worst so far, and I had a 3.62. I loved seeing my GPA rise, so I worked extremely hard. This semester, I somehow got straight As in my five classes!

I don't know how I got an A in one of them when it was supposed to be an A-, but I'm not complaining! I'm pretty sure that I got extra points because I talked to my professors. Seriously, high schoolers of TwoX, use your professors during their office hours! They get to know you better as a person and can help you out if you need it (with homework and with end-of-the-year grades.)

My current cumulative GPA is a 3.85, and that number is going to rise, I'm sure of it! No, I'm not in honors college (I'm doing just fine with the workload I have now), but if I keep raising my GPA I should end up with a fancy chord for graduation!

This is rambling because it's 1 am and I'm exhausted after a long couple of days and excited!
