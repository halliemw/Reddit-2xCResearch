I have a rather irregular cycle, and I go from maybe every other month for a few months to skipping two or three months since I've started menstruating. I had a rather long gap from menstruating (5 months) and last Wednesday finally started again. I'm not particularly sexually active, and on the safe side did take a pregnancy test which was negative about a month prior as obviously no matter how many precautions you take, you can never be too certain.

    The reason I'm posting is that my period has so far lasted EIGHT days, and it's making it's way well into a Ninth day.  I've had periods that have lasted a full seven days before, but usually I'm somewhere between five and six days. This is insane, it isn't' just a slow trickle either, it's a steady medium flow and slight cramping at times... Is this normal? Just build up from not having one for so long? or can this mean something else? 

   I have talked to a doctor before I started about my lack, and he did say that it was fine for me to not menstruate as long as it didn't reach the sixth month mark or so, should I talk to him about it again? I would just like some peace of mind or advice. I am not on any sort of birth control or medication of any kind.  Sorry if this isn't the right place for this, but I didn't know where else to post.

*edit Formatting is weird I don't know how to fix it...
