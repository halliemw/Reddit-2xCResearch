I was inspired to ask this after seeing the hair in the buttcrack thread.

Anyhow-long haired persons-how do you deal with shower drain hair? I usually fish out clumps of it periodically with a crochet hook (bleurgh) when the drain seems a bit cloggy, but I was wondering if there are hair catching products anyone would recommend. I have two daughters so things are only going to get harder on the drains.
