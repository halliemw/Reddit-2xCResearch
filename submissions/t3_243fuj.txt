I'm 21 and rarely masturbate. Never did before I was sexually active and was in a relationship for 6 years. Just barely got out of that relationship 3ish months ago, so I'm rather sexually frustrated. I've always been rather embarrassed about pleasing myself, anyone have issues like this and if you do do you have any tips on getting more comfortable with it? Maybe favorite toys I could look into buying...? Thank you ahead of time!
