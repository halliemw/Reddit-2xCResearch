Guy here, and new subscriber to this community (throw tomatoes now). The TMI stories are great, and it's honestly all more eye opening and interesting than it is gross (though it is also that). In the spirit of sharing stories that guys don't normally get to hear, I have a question:  would you care to relate your online multiplayer video game horror stories?

From my perspective and knowledge, most women gamers prefer to remain gender-unknown in online games, for fear of, well, us. Playing various MMOs over the years I've been guild mates with a lot of women, but general chats and random groups are almost always guys or unidentified. This has always made perfect sense to me, but usually when I mention this state of affairs to other guys, they typically just say "lol no" and say that there just aren't any girls playing. So I guess part two to the question would be, how often do you actually identify as women (or any non-male for that matter) in video games, if ever?
