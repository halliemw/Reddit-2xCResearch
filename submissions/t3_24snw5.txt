So, my mother in law is in a very bad relationship with my father in law, he has cheat on her several times and keep lying and not show interest on her. I have told to my mother in law to end with him, but I feel she doesn't do it because she is afraid of being alone, or not finding anyone else. She is beautiful, smart and funny, but I think she cannot see that because how her "husband" treat her.

I don't know how to help her to build self confidence, I told her already that she is beautiful, that she could find someone better, and at least, she says that she is not willing to give more in that relationship but she doesn't break it up either ( they don't live together though, he lives in our home country and she in the US).  How can you help someone to build self confidence?, 

I live 5 hours away from her, but I have talk with my husband to try to go and stay with her at least once every month. What else can I do?
