I've been on and off yasminelle for the past few years. I also have PCOS so my periods have been slightly irregular but never to this extent. I basically havnt had a period in the past 4 months. I've taken a pregnancy test twice during this time and both have been negative. 

I called my doctor last week and she explained this was totally normal and you don't get a full period on yasminelle you only get a light bleed. I told her I've been having nothing at all and she seemed slightly uninterested, like it was totally normal. Said it isn't the PCOS even though I'm aware that too can stop periods. I asked her if I should take another pregnancy test and she said this was unnessessary. 

I'm not looking to get pregant. Apart from the pill (which I take at the exact same time everyday) we don't practice any other forms of birth control. I like having my period each month as reassurance that I'm not pregnant. And I'm sure it can't be totally healthy for it to just dissapear. I've asked some friends who are also on yasminelle and none of them have experienced this. Should I be concerned?
