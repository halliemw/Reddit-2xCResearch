I love coconut oil and find that it moisturizers really well, but lately I've been using it as a leave-in before I put other products in. Problem is, this spring I've started using silicone conditioners - I find that they are really smoothing for my hair, and I don't have any issues with them as long as I clarify once a week (I use vo5 conditioner to co wash on other days). 

But will the coconut oil be doing anything beneficial for my hair (aside from making it easier to style and helping with frizz) when I probably have silicones left over in my hair from conditioner? I feel like it can't get to the hair this way. 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. 

Get back to me!
