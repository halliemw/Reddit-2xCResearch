I need some advice from you ladies. 
I am getting married in two months, and have a problem with one of my bridesmaids. Over the past few months, she has been blowing me off, and in general not talking to me that much. I get it, we're in college, I've probably played into that as well. However, she used to live with me and my other roommates, one of which is a now ex-boyfriend of hers (he is also the best man in the wedding). He ended up kicking her out for a list of reasons, and she took it out on my fiance. She never apologized for it, and he wanted her out of the wedding party. I said no, she's just going through a tough time. Today though, I just found out that she won't be going to my bridal shower, because she doesn't want to take off work. The weekend before she took off for her sister's graduation, so she said she won't do it again the following weekend.
Am I being crazy thinking that I should remove her from the wedding party? I'm really hurt that she wouldn't even try to make it to something that only (hopefully) once happens in my life. I feel like this is just the last straw, but I need level heads removed from the situations input...
Thanks ladies.
