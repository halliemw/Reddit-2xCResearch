(Throwaway because people IRL know my Reddit name)

I went back home for the weekend and talked with my dad for a bit. He mentioned that things with my mom and my stepdad are not going well. At all. A few weeks ago she came by to pick up my sister, and she had a black eye. Last week, Mom and Stepdad got in a fight, and he kicked her out of the car in the middle of an unfamiliar part of town; she had to walk around and find a church, no phone, no purse, nothing.

Both my mom and my stepdad have serious alcohol problems, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're both a danger to each other. But simply due to the size difference, I think my stepdad could pose a serious physical threat to my mom. He's also a hunter, so he has guns.

I'm really worried, I don't know what to do. I'd try to set her up with some info but I know he goes through her phone. I don't know if I can call her and not have him overhear. I'm worried that if I try to help her, I'm going to get her in even more trouble. My dad has encouraged her to get a divorce but she doesn't really listen to him.

I'm desperate for advice. What should I do? (If it helps, she lives near St. Louis, and she is very religious so I'm definitely open to finding church/Christian help for her. Even if it's just a Bible verse that I can text her.)
