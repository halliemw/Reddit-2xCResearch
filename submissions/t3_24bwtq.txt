I've already posted this on /r/birthcontrol but I though I'd put it to you guys too.

I've been on Levlen ED/ Femme- Tab Ed for about 6 month now. I've found it has made my periods lighter and shorter, less cramping and less PMS.
But its absolutely killed my sex drive. Its completely gone. 
I have seen my GP and she wants me to try Microgynon 30 ED.

I dont know if this is going to improve my sex drive because it has the same amount of hormones as the ones im already on.

Does anyone have any clue as to why this is happening or any idea of what I should try if the Microgynon fails to improve my sex drive. 
I was considering the Mirena but all the stories of constant bleeding worry me that I'll be bleeding too much to really be able to have sex anyways...
