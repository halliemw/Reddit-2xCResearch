My fiance and I had unprotected sex exactly 1 week ago. Last night before showering I noticed a dark brown streak on my panties (similar to the last few days of your period when everything is finishing up). It seemd to have only lasted for an hour, and there wasnt really a lot. As I woke up again today, I noticed a light brown color after wiping. It seems to have stopped though. I've never spotted during my cycles, so I am a little curious as to whats up. I ended my period 4 days before having sex, so it is probably not a menstrual thing. I have heard about implantation bleeding, but I have also heard that its impossible to get pregnant 4 days after your period. Anybody who can shed some light?
