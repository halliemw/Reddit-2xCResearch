So im having awkwardness with my ex...we have a son and he has never been involved in his life. Walked out when I was pregnant. He now has three kids and one on the way from now three different women. He's remarried and so am I and since he got married and found out his new wife is pregnant he's blown my phone up everyday asking about my son, wanting to see him, wanting more visitation(he's never used it)...and more recently he started following me on instagram and is liking and leaving messages on all my pictures like "damn girl" and "you got hot" things like that. Im not sure how to approach this. I haven't told my husband because obviously this will cause some tension since well ex husband vs husband is no fun.....im not even sure how to go about this change. He hasn't been around since I was pregnant my son is now four and my ex husband is wanting to establish a relationship with both of us and it's awkward.
