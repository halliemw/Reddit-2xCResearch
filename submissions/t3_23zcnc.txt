So last august i got a job as a receptionist/manager at a nail salon. At first i loved the job. It was only weekends but i was told that i would get a 4 day schedule soon, and each shift was 10 hrs so it was decent. I was also making 3 above min wage which isnt that much but i was told that i would get a dollar increase a year or so. My boss is a little old man and he works the other five days a week. Hes the owner and he is pretty stressed out often.

About 7 months ago he cut my pay. When i realized (because he doesnt give actual pay stubs) he told me that he couldn't afford to pay me as much. He then cut my hours and only has me working on the weekends again. He also has me work 9am-7:30/7:45 and doent pay me for that last 45min. Last month i went out and got another job that gives me 30 hrs a week and works around my school schedule. Its every week day and i get weekends off, something that I've never gotten in the 5 years that ive been working. After two weeks of working there i went and told my boss at the nail salon that i was putting in my two week notice. He essentially told me no, that i can quit but he needs me to work until may 10th. I said that i would work this upcoming weekend (tomorrow) and the weekend of the 10th and thats it. He replied with attitude saying that he needed more than a two weeks heads up. I am fed up and no longer want to keep my two weeks. He has me running the store, supervising the girls and dealing with the customers all for 25 cents over minimum wage and its not worth it to me anymore. I dont need the reference and every day that i work there i feel so drained, im ready to stop dreading the weekends. I just dont know what to say because i am a bit of a push over and i dont want to hurt his feelings or stress him out, and i dont know if i am okay to end my two weeks early or if i should stick it out. If anyones been through anything similar what happened?
