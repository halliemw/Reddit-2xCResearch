Almost 7 years ago I was raped by an acquaintance. I was 15. A year later after being hospitalized for PTSD my parents found out and the legal proceedings started. Long story short, he got away with it. There were other charges against him from other girls, I wasn't the first girl he attacked, but I don't know how that all turned out. Soon after the trial he began making fake Facebook profiles and harassing me. He'd either tell me he was going to hurt me or decide to call me a lying bitch and to take it back. It's been nearly three years since he's contacted me. Last night he found my twitter and he started up the same thing again, saying he was going to get me. The police can't do much because he uses fakes profiles. He tried to follow my friends, even a guy I just started a relationship and I can't tell him what is really going on. I'm afraid to go outside. I'm afraid to be inside. I feel like he's going to come after me when I least expect it and I'm terrified. If he really wanted to kill me wouldn't he keep quiet? I don't know what to do and I need advice.
