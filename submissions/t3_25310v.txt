My rather-large (over 1000 employees) office has an all-female administration team (secretaries, dept admins, reception, switchboard, etc)  and during the last two admin-training days full of serious, relevant training and talks, there has also been sessions scheduled for everyone with Colour Me Beautiful and a makeup artist. 

On one hand, getting your colours done, advice from a personal stylist on hair and glasses and clothes,  and a makeover including free makeup is awesome and a nice mood lightener. 

On the other hand, it a bit bugs me that this is included in the training of the dept that's full of women.  I don't see the male managers and directors getting "perks"  like a tailor fitting or a stylist session.  

Would you see it as the company doing something nice and fun that's in line with the interests of the attendees, or would you be slightly concerned it reinforces the idea that administration staff are only as good at their job as how they look?
