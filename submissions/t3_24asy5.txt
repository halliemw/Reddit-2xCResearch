Hey everyone. So basically I have this uncle who is somewhat part of our "immediate" family that we see every weekend. Sometimes he likes to squeezes my sister's thighs and rubs them for long periods of time when he has the chance i.e. in the car, etc. I think it's weird but no one says anything. He's been doing it since I could remember. He's 50 yrs old and single btw. with my mother he usually gropes her and touches her a lot sometimes. As well as calling her creepy pet names like "little one". My mom told me that it makes her uncomfortable also.
