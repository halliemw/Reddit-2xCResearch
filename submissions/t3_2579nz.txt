It all began last august when I (18 f) was at a festival. When I came home my mom said there had been this guy from my school at our house that wanted to talk to me, I wasn't there so he left. Now you have to know that I don't really know him and had only talked to him very briefly at school, he also gives of this really creepy vibe and doesn't have many friends, he is really weird (the bad kind). So then a couple of days later he wrote me a message on skype saying he loves me and that he has been thinking about me all the time since 6 months. Now we have NEVER really talked or anything and I DON'T like him so I answered that I don't want anything to do with him and that I wan't him to leave me alone and that I feel stalked bec he came to my house (how did he know where I live??). Since then he has been avoiding me at school but kept looking at me while class (thankfully I only have class with him once a week) so now 9 months later he texts me this poem at 4 am saying he has a light or something and if I won't take it he has to go to heaven and stay there forever. It felt like a threat. I wrote him to leave me alone and that he is a stalker. I feel so disgusting about this I don't want him to think about me and I'm scared that he will do something to me, this is such a weird situation I'm sorry this has gotten so long. I don't know what to do to feel better about this and I want to to stop thinking about this guy and him to stop thinking about me. I thought he was over it after that skype thing but now this
