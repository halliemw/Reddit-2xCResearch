I had my first abnormal PAP when I was 19. I was told by Planned Parenthood not to worry about it, everything would probably clear up without interference so it promptly slipped my mind.

Fast forward to last July, I was 24 (25 now) and I had another abnormal PAP. This time (because of my age I guess?) they decided to do a colposcopy/biopsy. Came back CIN1/2. I had the LEEP done in October. My margins were NOT clear btw.

My first follow-up in January came back normal, but the one from two weeks ago didn't. I have another colpo/biopsy scheduled for next thursday.

For those of you who've had to deal with this before, how many rounds of biopsies and procedures did you have? Is there any correlation between reoccurrence and the eventual progression to cancer? 

I really like and trust my GYN, but the whole office seems to be very dismissive with my concerns. 

I don't have children, but I'm not sure I want them (and am certain I don't want to go thru the pain of childbirth!). I was adopted myself, and am not opposed to adoption one day should I change my mind, so is it a complete overreaction for me to request they just remove my uterus so I never have to freak out again?

Any response will be appreciated.
