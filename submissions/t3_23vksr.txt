There's a lot of heavy stuff on the front page of this sub right now. I thought I might inject just a bit of happiness:

I believe in reddit anonymity so I've never told my bf what my username is. Well, I absentmindedly mentioned last night that someone had made a kinda jerk comment about it the other day (saying one of my comments was the most completely average thing they've ever heard - I realize I was asking for that and I'm not really upset about it). Anyway, a little while after I mentioned that to him he out of the blue told me, "you're not average, you're special to me". :)
