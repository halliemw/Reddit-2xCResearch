So first of all, I'd like to say that I DID go to the doctor but they couldn't get any results because it was too painful and uncomfortable (emotionally) for me to have the doctor shove a q-tip up my vagina. I did a pee test and am clear of STDs. 

It started about 3 weeks ago when I had a big flare up of itchiness. No discharge though. It didn't go away after a week so I went to the doctor. She said it looked like a yeast infection and prescribed me fluconazole. Itching went away slowly but surely, but I was still irritated.

Shortly after taking the fluconazole I had foul smelling discharge and some of the itching came back. I called by doctor and she just prescribed me another fluconazole. She said if that one didn't work in 5 days, to take another. 

So, all my itching is gone but now I have irritation along with foul smelling, yellowish discharge. Does this sound like a yeast infection? I'm starting to think it's something else. Bacterial vaginosis?
