We use to be very close during our school years and she really was my best friend, however when I got a new boyfriend we became distant. This was partly due to me being 'loved up' and wanting to spend my time with him, and meet his family etc. She soon began giving me the cold shoulder, and bad mouthing me to our mutual friends. Once I had clocked on to my bad friend behaviour, I sat down and apologised to her and explained I recognised what I had done was wrong. I made a real effort to try and rekindle our friendship, meeting up with her lots, just calling every now and then and checking how she was, and I even  tried not to be with my boyfriend in front of her when we were together at social events because she got so funny about it. *She has a boyfriend too by the way*

It is now 3 years down the line, and me and said boyfriend are still together and very happy. But me and my friend have never been able to rekindle our friendship. She is very judgemental, and has not been supportive of me when I struggle with anxiety and panic attacks. I feel like our relationship is very fake. I know that I am to blame for the start of our friendships downfall, but I apologised sincerely and really tried very hard to make things right. I feel so sad about this situation and could really use some help :(
Do you think I should just give up on our friendship??

EDIT: Thank you for the advice XX's and XY's. Have decided to move on and let her go.
