I've been on birth control for the last two years, always with a perfectly consistent period (almost to the hour). About a month ago I started getting blinding migraines. I went to the doctor and was prescribed Fioricet. I asked the doctor if the medicine would effect my birth control and she said "no, not at all." Then last month I didn't get my period. After trying to figure out what happened in the last month (I was never late taking a pill) I googled Fioricet and birth control and *every entry* talks about an interaction. I feel stupid for not doing my own homework, but I trusted my doctor.

I've had one abortion before, two years ago. I was in an abusive relationship. It was extremely hard. I wanted to have the baby, but knew it was not safe to go through with the pregnancy for me or the child that would grow up in that situation. I grieved for a long time, but I also felt very relieved. This time I am in a very supportive relationship with someone I will spend the rest of my life with, but we just aren't ready. The first time around my whole family was encouraging me to go through with it. I feel like if I told them I was pregnant and considering an abortion now it would just be...shameful. I feel guilty for being in this situation and angry because I thought I was doing everything right. A part of me feels like now that I'm in a good relationship, I ought to have the baby, that it's the "right" thing to do, that we would love it and do whatever we had to in order to raise it. But I have a very deep fear that it could come at the expense of mine and my boyfriend's relationship and our education/careers. It just seems smarter and better for everyone if we don't bring a child into the world right now. My boyfriend, though he is extremely supportive and equally rational, is also a devout Catholic, and he has a nagging guilt that us having an abortion would be grave sin. It doesn't change his feeling about what is right for us and for our future family, but knowing that he is feeling that kind of pain and moral conflict wears on my conscience as well. 

On top of those stresses, the abortion clinic in my town has within the last few years been bombed, in the past abortion doctors have been killed, and to this day there are protesters that stand fifty feet away from the door shouting at the women who go in. I lay awake at night imagining my boyfriend sitting in the waiting room while I'm having the procedure and the building gets firebombed. It doesn't help.
