Curious to see what /r/TwoXChromosomes thinks about this.

I was reading Her Campus like I usually do, and the post was titled "15 Things to Do This Summer". I don't always love Her Campus, so [this](http://i.imgur.com/RbzEkue.png) caption made me groan.

While I like that the image is trying to show that everyone is beautiful in a bikini no matter their size, the caption is "get fit" and the text seems to say otherwise. When I first saw it I was really pissed off, but I realize that this is the standard for a lot of the media we are consuming. It's easy to see how mixed messages about what is and isn't "beautiful" can lead to asinine phrases like "real women have curves".

So, what do you all think?
