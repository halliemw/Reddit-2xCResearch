I am a male and I am very much in favour of a male alternative to "the pill." 

I think that as a guy, I should have just as much a responsibility to keep my significant other safe from pregnancy as she does (and yes, I do think of it as a responsibility for us BOTH.)

Condoms can be ineffective ~~and much to a misandrist's disappointment, I don't want to be chemically castrated.~~ Besides, we enjoy sex. A lot. (I'm an idiot; that's how some birth control works. Still, no Depo-Provera for me. I like my sex drive.)

What is /r/TwoXChromosomes opinion on male birth control? Do women think that we, as men, should be just as responsible as you in this case?

(I honestly don't know how women feel about this. Excuse me if this is an issue women have or something they disagree with; I really have no idea.)

EDIT: OP is not "fishing for virtual blowjobs," OP just wants to know if women are okay with the idea of sharing the responsibility of staying "not pregnant." If she were to get pregnant, it'd be just as much my problem as it would be hers; I still have to raise the kid with her. I don't think staying safe should be a one-sided thing. If you're having sex (which generally involves two parties; in my case, a male and a female) you ought to be responsible about it.

Fuck me for a) looking for another person's perspective on the matter, and b) for not wanting to have a child as a university student and ruin my girlfriend and I's lives, right?

Also, I'm an idiot.
