This may be a small victory, but I wanted to share :)

I'm 24 and have been in a few relationships, but nothing over a year and nothing super serious. Most of the men I've dated have been very emotionally immature and have made me feel bad for expressing my needs or having my boundaries.
I've been dating my boyfriend for a few months and he is SO responsive when I express myself and my needs. I had never had intercourse before we dated but I decided that I wanted to take that step with him and am so glad I did! Because I'm not experienced, I've been kind of taking the backseat and letting him take charge. I also have had bad experiences with telling guys what I need in bed to get off outside of intercourse (they'll get they're feelings hurt) and was kind of putting it off. So a couple of nights ago, I womaned up and told him that while "having sex with you feels amazing, but I need a little more warming up and I need a little more stimulation on my clit if I'm going to come." We didn't see each other for a few days, but last night we got down to sexytimes and HOLY HELL. 

The man takes direction well. 

I'm still buzzing the next day from the orgasm I had!  I feel so good that I asked for what I wanted and got it and that I'm in love with a man who I can communicate my needs to (in and out of the bedroom) and that he feels the same way :)
