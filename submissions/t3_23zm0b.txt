I need lady advice. I frequent this sub but people in my life know my real username and I don't want them finding this post. Anyways, I want...need? An abortion.  I don't know where to turn to...where to go or even if i can afford it. I don't make that much money. I feel terrible. I feel so irresponsible. But I literally cannot afford a child. I have a terrible living situation. I just don't know what to do. I'm living in Wisconsin if that helps. I'm sorry this post is horribly written, I'm just in a dark place right now.
