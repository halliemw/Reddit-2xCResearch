My wedding is in about 4 months. Yesterday, I went dress shopping with my mom for the first time. Instead of shopping around multiple bridal stores or sleeping on it first, I gave in to pressure and bought the dress I liked the most, in fear of never finding the right one in time. It cost me quite a fortune, which I had been saving. Nonrefundable, nonexchangeable. 

Upon showing the dress to my best friend, whose opinion I trust, told me she absolutely hated it, and it looks like it's made out of doily. And that I look like a "melted ice cream cone". I feel so depressed. I don't know what to do at this point. I did like the dress, but it didn't quite feel like the perfect "one". I certainly can't exchange it or ask for a refund, and I hardly believe it's possible to sell it before buying another dress. 

Here is a picture of me in the dress, for reference: http://imgur.com/8aomyLY

I know that all that matters is how I feel about the dress, but when I heard her say these things, all I could think about is what a stupid, regrettable decision I had made. 

Any advice on how to deal with this, TwoX?
