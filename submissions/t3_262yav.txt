As the title states. I did not have sex and if I do, I plan to use a condom.

So, I forgot to take my pills on sunday and monday.. so I took TWO pills  today (tuesday) in the morning - I usually take them at night.

My question is - what do I do from there?

Do i take another pills that i am suppose to for today? or take two pills tomorrow at reg. time (night)?
