Reading the PSA: Rape Happens thread clarified my thoughts on why I am finding the defaulting so annoying.

This is a flawed metaphor, but bear with me.  Imagine that we are a calculus club.  We sit around all day talking about calculus, when suddenly a group of people barge in and demand an explanation as to why "2+2=4."  We say "Because addition, but that really isn't what we are talking about today.  Feel free to sit in, but we are talking about calculus."  They say "Tell us what it means you fucking Calcunazi bitch."

I found myself very frustrated in the PSA thread because there were some comments that were so erroneously wrong or questions that were very basic, that I couldn't not answer.  I just couldn't let a person ask "Wait, consensual sex can turn to rape without someone fighting? Have I been raping my girlfriend?" without answering.  I *COULDN'T*.  Continuing without answering would have been like playing a guitar without tuning it.  

BUT that wasn't the point of the thread!  And it was so incredibly frustrating to see comment after comment with people either wondering what 2+2= or insisting that 4 isn't the correct answer.  There is obviously need for dialogue, but TwoX wasn't supposed to be that place. It was supposed to be a place where we already all agreed that 2+2=4 and that a yes can change to a no mid sex.

The only solution I can see, now that we are defaulted, is to simply not engage.  Either downvote without replying (since very basic questions like that do not add to the discussion) and completely ignore the outraged "EDIT: I'm being downvoted for asking a fucking question! Seriously!" OR decide as a subreddit to post a standard answer like "This isn't what we are discussing here; feel free to post to /r/askwomen".
