We got into an argument last night because a couple of days ago, I mentioned to him that I want to start on a half sleeve on my left arm. Last night we finally got around to addressing it, and his response was, "Absolutely not."

First of all, I wasn't asking his damn permission. I wanted to discuss it with him because well done tattoos can be expensive, and we always discuss purchasing expensive items before actually doing so. He has zero problem with the cost; he just thinks that if I get this tattoo, I won't be taken seriously by any company I want hiring me once my contract with the Army expires. I explained to him that it's a half sleeve. I'm going to make sure that it won't be seen in my PT uniform (as per the new Army regulation). Therefore, it will only cover from the top of my shoulder to about 3/4 of my bicep. 

Secondly, it's MY body, and I already have tattoos. None of which you can see in uniform, but my second tattoo is on my collar bone. Does what he said hold any weight? Do many companies still feel that visible tattoos are unprofessional? If I needed to get hired on somewhere that badly, I guess I could cover it up during the interview, if it even showed at all. 
 
TwoX, I guess my questions are: Is my husband right? Is it worth it?
