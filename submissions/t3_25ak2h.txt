My husband and I divorced right after our daughter's 2nd birthday. She's about to turn 5 in July. She loves her dad. In the near three years he and I have been apart, I would say he has spent a cumulative total of about a solid 10 days of time with her. We live in the same city, I have told him multiple times I would take her to see him any time he wished. 

I've received a total of 120$ in child support from him in the last (almost) three years. Half the time when he is watching her, I will get a call and have to leave work or school to go get her because "He doesn't want to deal with her anymore." He did this again yesterday and I snapped and went off on him (Not in front of our kid, I never talk crap about him around her). He basically told me, not exaggerating, "You should just marry your boyfriend and have him adopt her if you think I'm such a bad dad." I asked him (because I was curious and shocked) "Are you saying you would relinquish your parental rights?" and he said "Yep."

My ex husband is not dangerous, he's just lazy. He's expressed to me several times about how sometimes he just wants to be done with "all of this." Still, he won't actively try and relinquish his rights, he was just saying that if I perused it, he would not stop me. 

I'm getting a lot of conflicting advice from a lot of people. I don't want to be the reason my daughter doesn't know her dad. I also don't want him to keep jerking her around and hurting her. If he did give up his rights, she would miss him very much for some time, but eventually, she might start healing. Right now, when he keeps ducking in and out of her life, he re-opens those wounds and she has to start healing all over. At the same time, I don't want her to harbor resentment for me because I took her away from him. 

I honestly don't know what to do. Any of you had a similar situation? Any of you grow up not knowing your dad? Any of you grow up knowing your dad and wish you had not?
