About a year ago, my ex from high school contacted me and we were catching up through text. I have no good feelings towards him, but I'm just going with the flow. 

He is now married, has three kids by three different women and as far as I'm concerned, he is no longer a part of my life. 

He started texting me in the morning, and kept going through the day. He started drinking apparently, and his texts reflected it. He started saying he wanted to leave his wife for me, my response was a solid no. I told him that I was not interested, never would be, and that his wife deserved better than that. 

After a while, he gave up. I went to sleep, and woke up the next morning to a voicemail from his wife saying that if I ever contacted him again, she was going to slit my throat. I texted her, in order to have a record of the convo, saying that I was sorry he acted that way, but that I had rejected his advances. She snapped and called me, threatened my son and me again, and hung up.

They lived about four hours away. They just moved back to my area. Should I go back to the police?

Why, when a married man makes advances and then is quickly rejected, does it become the fault of the woman who rejected him?

Tldr-what do I do?
