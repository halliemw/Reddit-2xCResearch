For example, I have been with my SO for 2 years now, I have never once spoken to his female best friend. Yet he spends a lot of time and she spends A LOT of money on him (she's rich so money isn't a factor for her). 


What are your thoughts on this? Who should make the first move

Edit: I missed out the part where I kind of hate her. He's never invited me to parties/events were his other group of friends have been, yet he is always at my parties and events.
