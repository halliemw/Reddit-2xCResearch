So, my boyfriend goest to happy hour about once a month with his work buddies. Over the course of casual conversation today he mentions that he got brownie points with the women in his office when at the last happy hour one woman, out of the blue, asked his opinion on shaving/trimming the female nether regions, and he responded with something along the lines of "do what makes you happy."

He asked me why she would haves asked him that, and said he wondered if it had "come up at home." The woman in question is married. My boyfriend, god bless him, is a bit dense. I gave him a couple of scenarios that might have precipitated this, and mentioned "she might have been flirting. Did that occur to you?"

He said it had occurred to him, and that about a year ago, at another happy hour, she had drunkenly kissed him, on the lips, briefly. No tongue. He informed a coworker, who found her husband, who took her home.  

Let me be clear. I trust my boyfriend. He wasn't hiding this from me, he just didn't think it was important. I'm not angry at him, and I'm not concerned that he would do anything inappropriate with this woman. Like I said, he's dense, and probably had no idea she was coming on to him, until she kissed him. He's not what society thinks is classically handsome, even though I think he's hot, and he can't seem to believe that anyone else might agree with me. 

I'm not going to do anything about this. His coworkers know he has a girlfriend. I don't go to happy hour cause that's his thing. I'm not jealous, exactly. It does concern me that a woman who has a marriage that is so unhappy that she's willing to kiss a guy in a bar with her husband 20 feet away seemingly has the hots for my boyfriend. And that she works with him on a daily basis. I guess I'm angry with her. 

I don't really know what I'm after here. Not advice. Support maybe? I dunno.
