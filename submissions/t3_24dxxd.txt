Quick Back story.  My wife has a history of kidney infections, she was also having pain during and after sex that started after a kidney infection. Went to see a Gyno/Urologist specialist, and she prescribed pelvic floor physical therapy for the pain and she's going to get surgery to fix the kidney issue.

She verifies that the therapist she picked is listed on the blue cross blue shield Alabama website as "in network" and starts going.  Fast forward 4 weeks, and the therapist says that the insurance will not cover anything, we have to pay out of pocket.  Therapist has never seen a claim just flat out denied, as even medicare covers pelvic floor physical therapy. (We are not in AL, but company ins is from there).

I am really mad and frustrated.  If my doctor prescribed me Viagra, even though I am not even 30, they will cover it no questions asked. But sexual dysfunction for women is not covered? What the hell? I get that one is physical therapy one is a pill, but this feels so misogynistic and wrong.

I called them and they are going to mail me an appeal form (ofc you can't download it).  I will fill it out and have both the PT and prescribing doc write notes with it but I am not hopeful.  Yes I don't want to pay 100% of this, but even more I am just really fucking pissed that they will cover men's sexual dysfunction but not women's.  Even ignoring that plenty of Viagra prescriptions are for guys who live unhealthy lifestyles and need it because their circulation and physical fitness sucks.  They have control of that and are still covered, but for women? GOOD LUCK. 

TL:DR - Insurance company covers men's sexual dysfunction but not women's. Pissed off and looking for similar situations or advice.
