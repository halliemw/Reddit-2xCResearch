I am a man. I have issues, I know, I need to sort them out. But on more than one occasion, I have felt the desire to just snap and become the biggest asshole even possible simply for my own personal wellbeing - and that includes mistreating women - thinking that maybe I was deceiving myself, that it wouldn't have as big an impact as I picture it.  

Ever since TwoX became default, I couldn't help but to read every thread that made the front page. And that strengthened my resolve - showed me that I knew the truth and that women's right truly are something to preserve if you can't fight for them. It reminds me of how important it is that I don't let go.  

So thank you TwoX for being a constant reminder of what women truly feel in these regards, to keep me in check. Peace out.
