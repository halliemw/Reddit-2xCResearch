Recently I tried to give advice and comfort to one of my friend's now-pregnant teen child. I wanted to give her insight into my experience and let her know that no matter how alone she felt, there were always people around that can empathize and show love. The reaction of the people around me blew my mind.

It is appalling to me that when I talk about my own experiences, others around me feel like it should be something I keep to myself.  "Why would you tell people?" they say. Why?? Because keeping it a secret and acting like it is something that we should not be talking about only affirms the misconceptions that it is wrong and you should be ashamed of your decision. Well you know what? I am not ashamed.   "Well you just didn't have enough information or know what you were doing at the time." Are you freaking kidding me?? You have no idea what i did or did not do and I don't appreciate the judgement.

I got pregnant at 16. The fetus was conceived from a date-rape with someone I thought I trusted.  I was intoxicated, and could not tell him to stop. I never told anyone, and at the time I blamed myself. I kept it from my family, but the rumors started to fly at school and it made it back to them.  My family is ultra conservative and was pro-life to this point. My father made it all about him.  "How could you do this to me?" At the time, I felt so guilty for 'putting my dad through this,' but I have since changed my outlook and allowed my true feelings to emerge.  Screw him.  I was a young girl, and in a position I was barely capable of understanding.  I was frightened, nervous, sad, angry, and all he could say was "how could you do this to **me**?" My mother was a little more understanding, but couldn't dare show it due to the nature of my family.  Either way, they asked what I wanted to do. 

I wanted to get a surgical abortion (medical abortions were not available at the time).  By the time my family found out, I had already done every bit of research I could.  I had looked into adoption, read about pregnancy, understood the process of abortion, and I had already made up my mind.  There was no way I would be able to take care of a child, and I knew it. I was well informed and took many nights to decide if this was really the right thing for me.  It was not a rash decision or one that I took lightly…even as a child.

"You're killing my grandchild," my father said when I told them my decision.  **YOUR** grandchild?!?! What about it being **MY** child? 
No matter who is pregnant, or who you are talking to, it is all about them.  It has everything to do with what *they* would do in the situation, or how *they* feel about it. And this goes for the people to which I share my story.  But you know what? I am not ashamed, and I will never quit talking about it. We all need to know that while making the decision to have an abortion is hard…there is no right or wrong answer. I made the right decision for me, and I have never regretted it.  Is it sad? Yes.  Do I think about it every day? Yes.  Do I wish I would have done something different? Not at all. 

**EDIT:  Thank you for all the supportive comments. Nothing anyone ever says will cause me to feel bad or shame for the decisions I have made, and I am glad to know there are others that feel the same.**
