I am a girl who loves shirts but has big boobs and a skinny waist. I've discovered that NOWHERE sells shirts that I can do up to the neck without the buttons opening over my chest. I was wondering if maybe a binder would work? (I am not wishing to transition, but just reduce my cup size!) Do any of you ladies have any tips/advice from a similar experience? 

Also I'd like to add that I'm a student so I can't afford tailored shirts, and this problem is with all highstreet brands. I am from the UK and this is mainly for my graduation where I want to look smart and have my shirt buttoned to the top.

Any and all advice would be fantastic! Also if you think this could be x-posted to any other subreddits I am up for all the advice.
