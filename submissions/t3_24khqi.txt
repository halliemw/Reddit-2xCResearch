Hi everyone -- so basically I have been feeling like I'm about to explode so I needed to share this story.

In August my boyfriend and I found out I was pregnant (big surprise) but when I went for a scan at 8 wks the doctor said I was going to miscarry. Because I was moving soon after that date I opted to have a D&C to get everything over with before I moved. I told my mom but not my dad (they're not together) and I even debated that because it wasn't planned, I'm still in school, etc. My mom is not a real source of support and we're not speaking now, and my relationship ended as well.

I didn't tell any of my dad's side of the family about this, but I'm living in the same city as them now so am closer to them than I was. A few months after the procedure I started getting pain so I went to the doctor and she said I might have some scarring, which would impact my fertility. So I was sitting with some of my family half an hour before my next appointment, really worried about the fertility thing, and they choose this moment to put the phone up to my ear and say 'talk to your cousin!' She is pregnant. I said congratulations etc then was crying straight for about an hour, and it's two days later and I don't feel any better. I have just been drinking to numb it out.

I'm not really asking for advice, I just had to tell someone.
