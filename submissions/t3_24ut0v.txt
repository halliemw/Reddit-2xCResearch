I feel like this sub is becoming more and more restrictive in what is allowed. This is supposed to be a place to freely post *serious or silly [content] - related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives* but I'm not really sure what is allowed anymore. I know that we don't want two-x to turn into red/blue pill but does that mean it's ok to censor things because mods don't like the 'tone'? What if thats the way we express ourselves? If we are not being offensive or saying/doing anything against the rules why should we be removed? 

Please chime in. Am i wrong for feeling this way? Has this sub been getting better and more open to different forms of expression and I'm just being overly butt-hurt b/c I got removed?
