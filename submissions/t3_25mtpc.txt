Not sure if this is the right place for this. Please direct me if not. Thanks.   

I am olive complexioned, which means that this long winter with no sun exposure has left me looking like I have a mild case of jaundice - hopefully someone can relate. Anyway, I went yesterday and I am looking eeeever so slightly pink in certain areas. My chest is a tiny bit itchy. But no peeling, no burns, no pain. The fact that its (eeever so slightly) pink and not brown makes me wonder if I should go again today or take a day off. I'm trying to get this done as fast as possible because my trip (the reason I'm doing this) starts 7 days from now. Advise please? Thanks!
