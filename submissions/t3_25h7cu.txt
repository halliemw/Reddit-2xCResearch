I'm 22 years old. No idea what I'm doing wrong. I tried when I first started period at 13, again after I lost my virginity at 18, and just a few minutes ago. 

I tried pushing it up all the way. It feels wierd as shit when I'm putting it in, almost like its not lubricated enough, but I'm bleeding everywhere so that's not the case. 

I always feel it. I feel it as I put it in, I feel it when I sit, walk, stand-- always. It almost hurts to take it out. 

When I walk it feels like its going to slide right out.

If it helps I'm using the cardboard ones. I'm using the regular ones. My flow isn't light. 

I looked up stuff online but it doesn't help me. Like do I shove the entire thing up there? Does something come off? I have no fucking idea what I'm doing.
