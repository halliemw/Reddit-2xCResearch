For a class at college we are able to travel abroad to Italy for two weeks. I'm very excited and I know it will be an amazing experience. But for those of you girls who have been there already, any advice? 

Will my hair dryer/flat iron work with just a plug converter or should I buy new ones? Shoe suggestions? Any travel tips would be welcomed.
