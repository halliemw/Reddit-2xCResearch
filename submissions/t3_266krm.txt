Hey guys, I think I'm overreacting but I don't really have any girl friends I can talk with to tell me otherwise. I don't know where else to go and I'm really just looking for some advice. I started taking birth control in September and like every one else, sometimes I forget to take it. At the end of my period last month (I was a couple days into a pack), my boyfriend and I had PROTECTED sex. We used a condom (which I prefer to do for personal reasons, even with BCPs.) We haven't had sex since then since college has ended and our alone time is limited. I missed the pills the following two days. I missed a couple of other days here and there, but again, we were not having sex. THe reasonable side of my brain is saying we're probably okay but there's still this side of me freaking out. Especially because I am almost four days into my placebo pills and my usual PMS symptoms are dormant. I'm hoping to find some support here and I'm also trying to vent and relax because I don't want to worry my boyfriend yet, but at the same time it's stressing me out and I have nobody to talk to.
