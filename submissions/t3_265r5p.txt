I'm going grey. I finally decided to start dyeing my hair once it was easily 30 noticeable strands instead of just the one or two, and now I've been dyeing it about every 2-3 months with my hairstylist for about a year. In the beginning, he was just painting the ones he saw, and I was really frustrated that he didn't seem to be doing a good job because I would go home and comb my hair and immediately see hairs that he missed. But I thought, maybe it takes time to start covering them all and not missing any. After a few times of this and the problem not going away, I told him I needed something more aggressive. So instead of just painting those hairs, he started dyeing my whole head. But I'm still seeing maybe one or two he missed once I get home. Even worse, it seems like the dye fades off my hair very quickly. Right now it's less than a month since I last saw him and instead of beginning to see grey on the roots, I am beginning to see entire strands!

Having never done this before, I don't know what to expect. Is this normal? Is missing a hair here and there normal for the hairstylist? Is beginning to see the entire grey hair within weeks normal? I thought that you only had to touch up your roots, and the hair strand stayed colored. I'm starting to get really frustrated that I don't look much different from when I went in after a few weeks have passed. Is this to be expected, and I should go more frequently? Or is this hairstylist doing a terrible job and using bad dye?

Thanks in advance for your advice!
