So I applied for a paid internship to do something I love and the grant money for the internship was for one person to do curriculum development for a nonprofit organization. However the organization decided to give the internship to me and one other person so now we are working half the time and each making half as much as we thought. This is not what is upsetting me.

I am upset because this person is a year younger than me, in the same program I am at university and seems completely unperturbed by the fact that he now has to share an internship. He sent his resume to me which apparently we were supposed to send to each other and I feel incredibly inadequate. I've been through student teaching, more coursework, had more time in the classroom and lesson planning, yet his resume and the fact that we both got the internship makes me feel like none of that matters. He's only a junior and already has done more than I have as someone who graduated and will be doing my Master's year. 

So this rambling may be confusing but the bottom line is that this person bugs me and I have to work with them. I don't know how to get over this and act professionally while collaborating with this person. Why am I being this way? I should be happy that I at least got the internship but for some reason I can't be. Maybe I just need to sleep on it. Help?
