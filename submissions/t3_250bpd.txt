Hey TwoX, this post was shared on the facebook group for a feminist club at my old high school and I thought this community would enjoy discussing it.  I thought her post was a very well written critique of high school dress codes.

Some points for discussion: do you agree with dress codes like this and why?  Is there a way to fairly enforce these rules?  The typical response is that these rules are unfairly enforced but I'd love to hear diverse thoughts.

Also, sorry about breaking rule 5 with my previous post, thanks for catching it and letting me repost mods :)
