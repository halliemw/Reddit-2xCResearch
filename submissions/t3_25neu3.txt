Throwaway because I'm kind of ashamed.

I have a disability. It's not life-threatening, and it barely affects my day-to-day life... ever, but it could maybe get worse if I became pregnant. There's no real proof either way--no major studies, even--just anecdotal evidence and enough concern from one doctor that I became really worried about becoming further disabled just as my husband and I were thinking about trying for a baby. 

We decided that we should adopt instead, and we've committed a lottt of money to the idea. But some days, I just don't want to do it. I'm afraid that the baby we might one day end up with won't love me or will always feel lacking because I'm not his or her "real" mom. I know I would love the kid, but I worry about society (since it's still ok to make adoption jokes on tv) and I worry about peers and I worry about... I don't know. Raising someone who will drift away from me one day? I know a biological child could do the same, and I know that a lot of adopted kids have amazing relationships with their parents. I just don't know of any positive examples in my own real life--only negative.

On top of this, my "biological clock" is screaming. Throughout the month, I have a few days where I'm ok with adopting and a few excruciating days where I'm just filled with regret at the decision because I just want "MY OWN" baby. I've never felt such a drive before. 

I feel like an awful selfish person.
