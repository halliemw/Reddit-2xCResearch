I feel like I am way too old to be asking this as it seems like something I should have figured out in my teens. But I have been in mostly long term relationships and new to the dating scene. With my last break ups there was a lot of trust and talking about emotions, etc. So the break up was natural and easy since it was obvious it was coming. But now I want to end this new 6 week relationship and I don't know how to do it since there isn't really deep emotion involved. Basically, I realized I just don't like the guy. I have begun to find him arrogant and don't enjoy hanging out with him. He is nice person but not the right one for me. I would appreciate any advice. Thanks TwoX.
