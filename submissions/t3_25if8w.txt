I'm sorry if this is not the right place for this, if it isn't could you please tell me where it should go?

Okay so I have this group of friends, well not friends, I have a best friend in the group and one good friend, the rest are horrible spreading rumors about me, lying about everything, one insults me to my face and they all emotionally manipulate me,the best friend is starting to believe these rumors.

I have another group of friends that I could sit with but that would require me cutting off the friendship with my best friend and 70% of the relationship with my good friend! I don't know if these new group of friends are nice or anything but there is no one else.

I feel like I should stay with the group of friends that are slightly mean because I've known them longer I don't know please give me some advice.
