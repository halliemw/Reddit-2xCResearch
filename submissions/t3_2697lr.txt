God I'm so happy right now! I wanted to share my good news with all of you! It took me 7 years of community college and a university, but I finally did it! All of my hard work, weekends studying, and papers have given me a bachelor's degree in psychology and a minor in sociology. I graduate this weekend and I'm so stoked! Everyone is so excited for me too and it feels really amazing to finally get recognized for my hard work. Everyone have a drink with me tonight! We're celebrating! :)
