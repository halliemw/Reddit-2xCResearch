I am currently 6 weeks pregnant with a wanted purposeful pregnancy. My husband and I also have a 2 year old son. I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks almost a year ago. My son's delivery was a traumatic emergency c section after 36 hours of labor. 

I am seriously struggling with this pregnancy. Everyday since I found out 2 weeks ago my doubts and sadness have grown. I constantly feel terribly sick and anxious. I'm crying all the time. About everything. I'm not able to properly care for my son due to how sick and exhausted I am. On top of that, I have awful anxiety about nausea and vomiting and can't seem to figure out where my real physical symptoms end and my anxiety begins. 

I feel like I would give anything not to be pregnant right now and find myself secretly hoping to miscarry again, even though miscarrying was awful. And I feel so unbelievably guilty and ungrateful for feeling this way. So many women would kill to have what I have. Why can't I be happy about this like I should be? Like I thought I would be? Is it only hormonal or do I really feel this way? What is wrong with me? And what the fuck am I supposed to do about it?

I realize this is very disjointed. I'm so confused right now.
