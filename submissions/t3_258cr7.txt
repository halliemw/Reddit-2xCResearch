In 1929, a bunch of women marched down the Easter Sunday parade in New York, proudly holding cigarettes. This was heralded as a success of the feminist movement achieving their equalility with men by smoking in public.

But, there was propaganda and emotional manipulation of women going on in the background. The movement was called **Torches of freedom**.

Quoting from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torches_of_Freedom):

"Before the twentieth century, smoking was seen as a habit that was corrupt and inappropriate for women. [...] Women’s smoking was seen as immoral and some states tried to prevent women from smoking by enforcing laws. [...]"


"Cigarette companies began selectively advertising to women in the late 1920s. In 1928 [George Washington Hill](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Hill) the president of the American Tobacco Company, realized the potential market that could be found in women and said, “It will be like opening a gold mine right in our front yard.” [...]


"To expand the number of women smokers Hill decided to hire [Edward Bernays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays/), who today is known as the father of public relations, to help him recruit women smokers. Bernays decided to attempt to eliminate the social taboo of women smoking in public. He gained advice from psychoanalyst A. A. Brill stated that it was normal for women to smoke because of oral fixation and said, “Today the emancipation of women has suppressed many of their feminine desires. More women now do the same work as men do. Many women bear no children; those who do bear have fewer children. Feminine traits are masked. Cigarettes, which are equated with men, become torches of freedom.”

"In 1929 Bernays decided to pay women to smoke their “torches of freedom” as they walked in the Easter Sunday Parade in New York. This was a shock because until that time, women were only permitted to smoke in certain places such as in the privacy of their own homes. He was very careful when picking women to march because “while they should be good looking, they should not look too model-y” and he hired his own photographers to make sure that good pictures were taken and then published around the world. Feminist Ruth Hale also called for women to join in the march saying, “Women! Light another torch of freedom! Fight another sex taboo!” Once the footage was released, the campaign was being talked about everywhere, The women’s walk was seen as a protest for equality and sparked discussion throughout the nation and is still known today. The targeting of women in tobacco advertising led to higher rates of smoking among women. In 1923 women only purchased 5% of cigarettes sold, in 1929 it increased to 12%, in 1935 the percentage of cigarettes purchased by women was 18.1%, this percentage peaked in 1965 at 33.3% and remained at this level until 1977."
