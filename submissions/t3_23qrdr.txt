So I've searched this sub about as much as I can so far and I've gotten mixed reviews on how people feel about it. 

I'm interested in it because I've been on birth control pills for going on 10 years and I'm sick of taking those things daily. My life has gotten more hectic recently (grad school, full time job and multiple volunteer/leadership positions) and I'd rather not have to worry about it. I'm in a long term relationship where we don't want children any time soon (probably never) so I'd really like to not get pregnant.

Some women have said they completely lose their periods and others say that they bleed for long periods of time after the initial implantation. I'm curious to know if the women who lost their period are smaller (weigh less) and that may be why. I have a overweight BMI and I'm concerned that it will cause me to bleed for months on end at the beginning. Other thing I noticed is that women said they lost their sex drive. I already have a pretty low sex drive, I think it has to deal with self-esteem and negative body image more than actual sexual desire. 

Any comments or recommendations would help. 

**TL;DR: Women on Nexplanon. If you lost your period can you tell me if you are overweight? Did you lose sex drive while using this form of birth control? Any other bad side effects?**
