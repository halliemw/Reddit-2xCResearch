Throwaway and sorry for my English, it's not my native language.

So I've been with my new boyfriend for a few months, and the sex is amazing. I've always been, well, loud in bed. You could say a "screamer"... We often hang out and have sex in my boyfriend's apartment. Today when he was leaving home, some woman came and complained about our sex noises and how my screaming echoes throughout the house! I had no idea at all (I mean we barely ever hear noises from others) and now I'm MORTIFIED. I feel so embarrassed and dumb for not being considerate and just screaming in my pleasure... 
So ladies, has anyone else here gotten complaints about their sex noises? Please tell me I'm not the only one so I can put this behind me and keep quiet and look his neighbors in the eye again!
