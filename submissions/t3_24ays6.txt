I have only been with my new girlfriend for about 6 months and we have been exceptionally happy with our relationship. 

Recently, we realized that she was late for her period and after 4 days took a test. After she found out that she was pregnant she called me to verify and told me that she wanted to go through with an abortion.

She is still going through college and feels as though she must take the necessary step to ensure that she has a successful future. Also, I am not in a position to financially support both her and the child.

The appointment date is coming up soon and she is struggling with the idea and is constantly upset at the situation. She is sticking to her conviction but gets distraught at the idea. I have tried my best to comfort her but feel like I am not doing the best job.

How can I better help her through this process? Any words of encouragement or comfort to express to her would be greatly appreciated.
