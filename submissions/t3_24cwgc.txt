Coming up to the end of my masters, so anxiety around that is feeding this too, and I am worrier anyway. BUT. 

Broke up a major relationship beginning of the year. Amicable, guy was very good about it. All credit to him. Had a 6 week fling with someone, he broke it off, we remained good friends. 

House share I was in broke down, I am miserable. Second guy offers me to stay with him for a bit, till I sort myself out/know what I'm doing. It's fun living there, he's a good guy, and a nice person, we get on really well. He's charging me very little rent, so I can save up for a deposit/similar. He owns it outright (is older, had lots of savings and help from family). 

The problem is that I am a massive fucking sponge. I don't want a relationship, but him being around and having slept with him before means that it seems very strange for me not to do it now - I am a really base creature like that! We're spending a lot of time together, but it's such a laugh. 

I don't want to move out, I've got a good deal here and he's given me a massive gift, but I am unsure how to proceed. I've got it in check for the minute but if he starts seeing someone else I'm not sure what I'll do. 

Any advice welcome, similar stories, etc. Is there any hope of me getting out of this alive?
