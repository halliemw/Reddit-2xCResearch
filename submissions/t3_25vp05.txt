I've been subscribed to this sub for a year or so (on my regular account) and while I haven't ever posted anything myself, it is so nice to see how accepting and non-judgmental this community is to everyone who posts.   

I'm [F22] having an issue within my relationship (that probably belongs in r/relationships, but I'm scared of that sub :( lol and don't really want the whole world to see my question). I'm not comfortable posting the whole situation, but I'm looking for someone to talk to. Someone I can trust, someone I could maybe PM, who doesn't mind listening, and maybe give me an outsider's opinion on the situation and some advice.   

This may not be the best place for me to ask for this, maybe there are subs dedicated to this? I don't know. I'm just looking for a stranger I can trust and someone to help me get this off my chest, and I feel like there are so many great, caring people in here who would fit that description.  

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this. If you'd rather direct me somewhere else, that's okay too (outside resources, other subs, etc.). Thanks for reading!  

TL;DR: Basically just looking for someone to talk to about a personal issue in my relationship.
