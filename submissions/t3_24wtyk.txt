I'm posting here because you ladies are always understanding, I'm sorry that this is not the most relevant post. So growing up, I got into a habit of lying as it was a safe, easy way of diffusing conflict. However now I'm at a point where it is safe to be honest, but my mind still jumps to lying first and I have to deliberately think about it if I'm going to tell the truth. 

So at work I have to apply to register for this federal scheme so I can get this paperwork which is important to doing my job. I had a total mind blank and didn't register before applying for the paperwork, so naturally I got back a polite rejection. 

My boss came in and I told him how I got rejected and would be reapplying, and he asked why. And instead of the sensible "I forgot to register first", I said "I entered my registration number wrong". I don't even know why I said that. So now I'm worried that this is going to ruin our good working relationship. 

So should I just let it slide and hope he doesn't find out, or should I go to him and tell him I misunderstood and here's the truth, or straight out tell him I lied, apologize, and tell him the truth. I'm just worried that the admin people will call work and he'll be caught out not knowing the whole story. Or I'm worried that my coworker will bring it up with him (if it werent for gossip this town would collapse) and then I'll look even worse. 

Tldr: lied to boss, should I tell him the truth or just let it slide.
