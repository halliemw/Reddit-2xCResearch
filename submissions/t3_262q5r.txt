Two weeks ago (May 9) I had sex with a guy that I consider to be a great friend. We were on/off hook-up buddies from like 2010-2012 and I tried to rekindle things in 2013 but he wanted a girlfriend and I didn't want a serious relationship with him. On the 9th we went to a concert together, I got hammered, and he invited me to spend the night. We had sex, but I was really drunk and don't remember a lot of what happened. 

The one thing I do remember is that he asked me if I was on birth control and I said yes. **I lied. I was not on birth control and we had unprotected sex**. Drunk me wanted to have sex and thought it was a good idea to lie instead of just getting a condom. I hadn't taken birth control in about a month due to complications with the doctor's office and general laziness (I honestly didn't think I would be having sex for a long time). 

I took a pregnancy test today and there was a faint but clear 2nd line. Most of the sources I read online said that this meant a positive pregnancy. I've decided I want an abortion, but I'm uncertain if I should tell the guy about it. I fear he will either be mad at me for lying about being on birth control or that he will not want me to get the abortion. He's not religious and I'm not sure if he's pro-life or pro-choice, but the mere possibility of him wanting to keep it makes me nervous. 

Should I keep him in the dark about it all and hope that it never gets brought up? Or should I tell him? I'm going to get a blood test this week to be sure and if I did tell him, I would tell him after the results of the blood test.
