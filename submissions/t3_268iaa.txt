When discussing movies, tv, and games, it is often said that both male and female characters are designed to appeal to men. 

Idealized women are "objectified" to appeal to a male audience.
However idealized men are said to be "Male Power Fantasies" - they are designed to look how men want to look themselves, and not because women should find them attractive. They are handsome because men want to be handsome. They are muscular because men want to be physically powerful (and not because the muscular physiques are designed to appeal to women.)

So, for example, the reason that Wolverine looks [like this](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/51f67cd069bedded60000009/the-wolverine-slashes-past-the-competition--heres-your-box-office-roundup.jpg) on film and Batman is [drawn like this] is to appeal to a male power fantasy. Conversely, Black Widow [looks like this](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/screencrush.com/files/2014/01/black-widow-poster.jpg) on film and Lara Croft [looks like this](http://cdn.pjmedia.com/lifestyle/files/2013/03/lara-croft-tomb-raider-2012-screenshot-cg.jpg) in games in order to titillate male audiences

So who is an example of a "Female Power Fantasy" rather than someone designed to appeal just to men? Theoretically, she should be attractive, have an idealized body type, be intelligent/skilled/influential (if the explanations of the male power fantasy hold true). 

How do you tell the difference between an idealized woman to appeal to men and a "Female Power Fantasy" designed to appeal to women? 

Who is the "Female Power Fantasy" you would choose to show your daughter?
