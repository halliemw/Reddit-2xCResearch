I recently lost 132 lbs. Suddenly, I've gone from "Almost never gets hit on" to, "If I'm not mean about saying no, they will keep trying." I grew up fat. I was always fat. Now, I feel like I'm ill equipped to handle aggressive men. I'm an extremely social person. I make friends like it's my job. Still, when it comes to getting hit on by a guy aggressively, I freeze up bad. 

A few days ago at work (retail), we had a guy who looked to be in his 70's come in (I'm 26). He immediately started to lightly flirt with me. Ok, cool. Old guys hit on me all the time and I flirt back a bit and humor them, mostly because I almost always never took them seriously. Well things quickly turned wrong. He started getting really explicit and nasty. At this point I froze up. Suddenly I wasn't talking much, because I didn't know what to say. 

He took that as an insult I guess, and he got mad and started telling me I needed a boob job, as well as several other mean things about my body. At that point, I got overwhelmingly anxious, and didn't say a word. I was frantically trying to think of how I could get this guy off my back without being rude and losing my job. Finally, as he escalated, I ended up just turning around and walking away while he was in mid-sentence. I then sat in the back and listened to him asking one of my co-workers what time I got off. Thankfully, she lied.

This has never happened to me to this extent before, but it happens to a lesser degree quite often. When I was fat, I used to feel "lucky" to be hit on by anyone. If I wasn't interested in a guy back then, saying "Oh, I'm sorry, you are great and all, but I have a boyfriend"  would make them go away. Now when I say that, many guys keep trying. I hate being mean. I don't have a mean bone in my body. Ideas?
