Hi there! I hope someone can shed some light.

When I am busting to pee and sit down on a toilet, it sometimes (like once every few months) will shoot out of the toilet, through (??) the top of the toilet seat, down the outside of the toilet and makes a puddle where the feet go. That means my pee is coming out at some ridiculous angle that seems to defy the laws of gravity. I don't notice it's happening until I look down to pull up my undies. What the hell is going on exactly. 

I've peed on far too many floors. I need to know I'm not alone.
