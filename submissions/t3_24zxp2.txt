So I have a few questions about this now being a default subreddit. 



1. Is there anybody here, at all, who thinks that becoming a default is a good idea or supports it? I have seen nothing but comments saying that this is a terrible thing and that we are doomed. (I know the reasoning, I know that there are plenty of people out there who will not add anything relevant to the dialogue, but I think this can be a good thing as well)


2. I know that many men are already posting "Oh but not all men are like that!" comments, and it seems like people are already getting fed up with it. I am not sure why people are annoyed by this. It seems to me that you should be happy to clarify your view with someone if they are legitimately interested. Not be upset with them for trying to share their point of view with you. So can you please explain why this influx of new visitors who care about these discussions is a bad thing?


3. This is not actually related to our new status, but a question in general. And more of a curious "how this place works" than anything else. This will sound like I am trying to be a jerk, but I swear I'm not. At one point I saw a post on here about someone that had just accomplished something great. (I THINK it was graduating college, but I can not quite recall what it was. ) It was a great accomplishment, but it had nothing to do with being a woman (as far as I can tell). It was simply "I achieved this great thing, just so you know". I asked how this post was relevant in the guidelines "4. Relevance: Please submit content that is relevant to our experiences as women, for women, or about women". I did not get any explanations, just a ton of downvotes. 
Was I in the wrong for asking how this relates to XX?


Thanks for your time and your thoughts.
