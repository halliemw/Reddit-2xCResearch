Imagine Valentine's Day and absolutely everyone you know has the most considerate, loving partner. EVERYONE. And you're the only one who got dumped three years ago and hasn't gotten a phone call since. 

This is Mother's Day for me. And everyone is posting about it on Facebook, talking about it on TV. I can't escape. Not all mothers are loving. Mine decided to cut things off with me because it "wasn't working out". Absent fathers are relatively commonplace but no one speaks out about absent mothers - are any of you out there in my shoes!?
