Hi Ladies! 

Okay so this morning I was freaking out because I couldn't find my Mirena strings. I got the Mirena two weeks ago at Planned Parenthood and everything was going great until I couldn''t find my strings. I freaked out and walked in today to get it checked. The gyno checked and could not see it either. Then she slightly opened the opening to the cervix and saw that the strings were resting right at the opening. She said the IUD was in the right position and everything was fine. 

However, I am concerned because now I won't be able to check my strings every month because they are too short. So how will I know that the IUD is in the right position? I mean the whole point of getting the IUD is to have greater peace of mind. She told me that I should not worry and just live life normally. But if I really was concerned the only option would be to have it removed and insert a new one with longer strings (which would run me another $625).

What would you ladies do if you were in my position? Would you get it removed, reinserted, and pay up for the extra peace of mind? Or would you live with it and trust that its all okay? 

Thank you so much!
