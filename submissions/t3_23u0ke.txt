For a while, I've known he was a creeper.   Mr. Charming to most who "know" him.   I know who he is.   This man who wore the mask of a martyr for staying with me through my past mistakes.   I was imperfect, an addict, numbing the pain of his mental abuse and lack of real love.  I didn't quite understand that at the time.   I even strayed during our off times.   
Years ago, I found my will to be healthy, and a better person.   
Through it all, he would bring my past up against me whenever he was angry... even using it against me with our children... Because, he was the martyr who "saved" me, who never strayed, I deserved to pay penance and be kept in a virtual prison.  I've worn the scarlet letter for far too long.   
For a couple years now, I've known about the dating profiles,  I had my suspicions for a long time, but no proof.   A year ago, caught him sexting and planning to hook up with a woman. .. That was of course blamed on my past.   I've seen a few other attempts since then. 
Now, I've gotten the bombshell.  I had a conversation with is secret girlfriend of 15 years; longer than our own relationship, by a couple years.   She was trying to contact him to inform him that she had tested positive for an STD.  He doesn't know that I know.  He's going about acting completely normal.  He has no intention of telling me. 
I'm confronting him next week, after I get my blood work.  I don't know for sure what will happen, but I do know that his facade of the martyr will be broken and the hypocrite will be revealed.  
I have grown, and continue to strive to be a better human being.   He is incapable, it seems.   I pity him.
