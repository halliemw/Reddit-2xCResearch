have any of you ever had luck in dropping hints to a dorky guy that probably isn't used to asking girls out?

so i'm a waitress at a bar/restaurant and this late 20s dorky guy comes into my work every saturday night.  he always comes in alone and sits at a table at the bar by himself.  i try to always serve him because he's a really good tipper, he's kinda cute, he's fun to talk to, and he's a really sweet guy (i say he's sweet because he's really shy and he's never gotten creepy with me or any of the other waitresses...low standards i know, but we have a lot of creepy creeps at our restaurant).  anyways, he recently came in with co-workers and i just found out that he's a doctor and that makes me even more attracted to him (i love the smart ones...just saying words i don't understand gets me going :p.  anyways, have any of you ladies had any success in getting a shy guy to make the first move.  i've tried to drop hints like saying i'm single and looking for a boyfriend, but he hasn't picked up on it yet, or he's maybe just too shy to ask.  i can't ask out a customer, but i want to make him know that if he asks me out, i'll definitely say yes
