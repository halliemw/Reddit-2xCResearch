We've all been to Plato's Closet, Goodwill, thrift stores, etc to get cheap used clothes. Hell, I would much rather buy used jeans than new, because they're already worn in. Out of curiosity, what is your take on buying used underwear? Obviously stuff that is stained/dirty is not acceptable, but otherwise clean, gently used, or never worn underwear that just doesn't have tags? Me personally, I don't care, as long as it's clean. It's just clothing, and there is this amazing invention called the washing machine. However, it seems like underwear seems to be a taboo. 


Basically, I want to know how many of you would be into buying something like used (cute!) undies for cheap, and whether there is an existing sub or anything for that. Yes, I am aware of /r/pantyselling but unlike those, these are strictly non-modeled, just for sale to get rid of them. I know that /r/braswap exists for bras. Here's my scenario, I have FOUR full drawers of underwear that I will likely never wear. Most of them are new, without tags, or are in really good shape, and just don't fit. You can't seem to donate underwear to the needy, and you can't seem to get rid of them unless you're willing to model them for fetishes. So what would you do with all those super cute, gently used, name brand panties laying around?
