Hi Ladies. I am freaking the fuck out over the lost strings of this Mirena IUD. I have an appt at PP today to check it out. I am TERRIFIED of having to have surgery over this? I really hope they can just find the strings with the hook. I was up all night reading horror stories which was a dumb move but I could not stop myself. Has anyone ever had a positive outcome from lost IUD strings? Can someone please tell me its not as bad as I'm making it out to be in my head. Thank you.
