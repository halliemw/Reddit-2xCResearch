My parents are really good parents, but they have a really terrible marriage. They've been married for 20 years, but they have bad communication and they stone wall each other or yell at each other or break down doors when they're angry at each other, or drag me (21f) and my sister (31f) into the argument to try to be mediators. They stay married for who knows why? Because divorce is not an option in their eyes, I guess. Though it has been threatened many times before.

I'm in a serious relationship with my boyfriend, we're thinking of marriage. But I am so very afraid that I'll mirror all the arguments and sucky communication in our relationship. Sometimes, I can feel myself acting like my mother or father when my boyfriend and I argue or I need to communicate a need. I have no other role models for "good" relationships. Things look warped if they don't look like my parent's relationship. My sister and her husband sometimes look like my parent's relationship also, I've noticed. How do I not become them?

I do admire my parent's dedication and ability to keep going despite arguments and still laugh with each other and stuff like that, but at the core of it, I'm deeply afraid I'll become like them.
