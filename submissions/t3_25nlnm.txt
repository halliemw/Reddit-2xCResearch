I've been trying to use birth control pills for a while now, but I've had nothing but bad luck. First I tried Trinessa. First time I tried it I stupidly started on finals week thinking that I wouldn't get any side effects. Instead I felt awful. I kept vomiting, had bad diarrhea, and constantly felt dizzy. I stopped because I had to finish my finals and the effects went away almost immediately.

I tried again a month or so later and instead had an allergic reaction to it. I had no other side effects that that time though. I was just covered in rashes though. I stopped that after about three days.

I then tried Minastrin 24 Fe. That was just terrible. I had diarrhea and nausea. I somehow ended up with a fever and couldn't do anything other than lay in bed feeling terrible for two days after I stopped taking them. I think at that point I had only had two of the pills.

I still want to try taking a birth control. My boyfriend suggests I stop because it just may not be the way for us. He doesn't want me going through all of this when condoms are so much easier for me. I still want to try one more to put my mind to rest I guess. Third time is the charm? I'm still pretty scared to try though. 

I suppose I'm just asking is there any good birth control pill I can try next? And if that doesn't end up working can I just never use birth control pills?
