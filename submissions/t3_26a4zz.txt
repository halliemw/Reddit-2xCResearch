So tonight i was hanging out with my mostly male group of friends and one of my friends invited a guy from his work. Newcomer. Yay. We're a pretty raunchy group so one of my friends started talking about how he found a probably months-old used condom caked to the carpet under his bed. That spawned a conversation amongst the men talking about how messy it is being a person who produces semen. So i, feeling left out, attempted to join the conversation by explaining that vaginas are a constant mess and sometimes you flex your core to stand up at a restaurant and suddenly you have a watergun in your panties. This new dude literally told me to shut up because he didn't want to hear about it. Keep in mind this is my close group of friends who have been my go-to group for over 4 years and his first night. 

Has this ever happened to y'all? Being shut out of an already gross conversation because vaginas are even grosser? I'M SO HEATED AND INSULTED!

Edit: I honestly wasn't expecting to get this many responses on my post. So thank you to all the women for sharing your experiences and opinions on the matter. To the men who also offered your experiences with learning about how the female body works, thank you as well. It really makes me happy when I encounter men who truly care about the women in their lives and have a desire to understand their struggles and simply how their body works. Unfortunately, there were also some negative responses from men who insisted that either women complain too much, or that they don't understand why interactions like this are insulting because basically "yeah it's gross get over it." Never once did I claim that it wasn't gross. I just wanted to know why it was grosser than male functions. No one seemed to have an answer for that, and it was extremely disappointing. Regardless, I do not regret posting this and I'm so glad that this sub exists.
