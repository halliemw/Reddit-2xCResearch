My daughter recently turned 13. She's very tall (about 5'8), and will likely grow a good deal taller. She wears size 11 women's shoes, which suggests that she'll end up right around 6 feet.

She is fine with herself as far as most of her self image goes; she's intelligent, athletic, has plenty of friends, etc and she knows her strengths.... but the fact that she's so tall and will almost certainly get taller bothers her. She has said (quite often and with increasing frequency), "I hate that I'm so tall" / "I don't want to be tall" / "I wish I wasn't so tall"/etc. The feet thing bothers her quite a bit, too, especially now that it's harder to find shoes. Didn't help that the sales rep suggested she look at the men's shoes....but I digress. 

Of course, I think she's beautiful no matter what... but I'm biased and she knows it because I freely admit to my bias.

Of course, as a typical Dad, my thinking is, "There's not a whole hell of lot you can do about that, so why are you complaining? Make the most of it! Hell, it's why you're first string on the volleyball team!".... but she's a 13 year old girl having body issues. I know that's not a particularly *helpful* response.

So, women of reddit that went through something similar..... What things did people do our say that made things better for you at that age? What things did people do or say that made things worse for you at that age? Any advice for me in general?

Oh...and my wife is on the tall side as well, but not so much that she ever had an issue with it. Our daughter gets her height mostly from my side of the family.

EDIT: Holy SMOKES that's a lot of good advice! Thanks, ladies! I'm at work now and don't have time to respond to everyone, but thank you all for your input. This has been very helpful.
