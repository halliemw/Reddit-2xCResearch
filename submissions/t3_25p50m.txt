I'm 26 and still get totally grossed out by inserting my fingers into my vagina.  I feel nauseated even thinking about it.  It just makes me uncomfortable.  I'm very comfortable with my body in general, very health conscious and have a very healthy sex life.  I don't mind when my partner inserts his fingers but I don't like when he moves around and I can sort of feel the pelvic bone, etc. 

I'm wondering if this is unusual.  It just creeps me out but I feel like, especially as a 26 year old woman, I should be able to touch my own vagina and not get the same cringey feeling I got watching the birds and the bees video in the 5th grade.


Thoughts?  I guess I'm more curious than anything else. 

It bothers me that it bothers me...right?
