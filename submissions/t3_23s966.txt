Tennessee's General Assembly has passed a law that would make women [criminally liable for the outcomes of their pregnancies.](http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/10/tennessee-legislature-passes-far-reaching-bill-make-pregnant-women-criminals/) The bill targets women who use narcotics illegally during pregnancy, but is written so broadly that any pregnancy loss thought to be connected to an 'unlawful' act can be grounds for investigation, arrest, and prosecution. This means that anyone who has a miscarriage at any time in pregnancy or gives birth to a baby with health problems can face criminal investigation. The penalties are assault charges, which can carry up to 15 years in prison. 

This is bad business for a lot of reasons. 
* It is [meanspirited and counterproductive](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/opinion/criminalizing-expectant-mothers.html): women who struggle with addiction need health care, not handcuffs. 
* [Medical experts recognize](http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Health_Care_for_Underserved_Women/Substance_Abuse_Reporting_and_Pregnancy_The_Role_of_the_Obstetrician_Gynecologist) that the threat of prosecution actually hurts babies by driving women away from prenatal care.
* The law will [disproportionately punish black women] (http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/04/17/tennessees-pregnancy-criminalization-law-will-hit-black-women-hardest/), who are more likely to be blamed for their pregnancy outcomes. 
* Prosecutors claim that *only* addicted women who don't seek treatment will be arrested, and they will *only* be charged with a misdemeanor. But [nothing in the law](http://www.salon.com/2014/04/21/you_cant_always_trust_people_to_do_the_right_thing_how_a_law_split_pro_life_gopers_in_tennessee/) limits it in this way. 

Prosecutors and police shouldn't have a place in pregnancy: this is the first time a state has passed a law that gives them an in. 

The bill is currently awaiting Governor Bill Haslam's signature. Groups are circulating a petition [demanding that he veto the law.](http://action.rhrealitycheck.org/page/s/gov-haslam-veto-pregnancy-criminalization-sb-1391)  I hope you will sign, and I would also appreciate your suggestions as to where else I might post.
