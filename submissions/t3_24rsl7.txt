I'm in a position where I feel like I'm really and I have a "friends with benefits" sort of relationship going on (I'm 18).  
What we have is purely physical, but I'd always hoped the guy I lost it to would actually be in love with me. My patience is wearing thin and I don't want to wait if the first time will be mundane and an anti-climax. I'm just not sure what to do? Will I regret losing it to this guy? Please help girlies.
