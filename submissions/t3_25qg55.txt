Sorry, gals.  From [fixing memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrollXChromosomes/comments/qhu3a/gamer_girls_fixed/) to [solidarity](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/lg2zn/my_roommate_l_is_transgendered_and_works_for/) I've tried to be a twoxer with the rest of you and the best of you.  Unfortunately, I cannot continue to fight the trolls and in doing so support the Mods' complicity with deconstructing the "safe" in "safe space" that was pre-Default 2xC.  

I love you all.  You will be missed.  You may find me in the Fempire, lurking around /r/SRSWomen instead.  <3
