I'm just curious because I've tried the disposable brand (i forgot the name) liked it well enough but it ended up irritating my bits, and one totally busted on me. I also had a time of it getting them in there so I was concerned about splurging for the beloved diva cup.  we have heard all the good reviews are there any bad ones? Does anyone not like them?
