[support]

Ever since she moved in she's been making my life hell. Nothing I do is good enough, and I can't have a single conversation with her without it devolving into a conversation about my faults. When she has a bad day she comes home and expects my undivided attention and support, but when I have a problem it gets swept under the rug as "it'll work out". She has depression, which I try to help her with, but she knows that I have anxiety issues that she seems to actively be setting off. I've started having panic attacks because I feel so trapped at home. 

I need to move out, but I have nowhere to go. 

Edit: Thanks **so** much to everyone who commented. I wrote this while I was really upset, but now that I've calmed down I'm going to try and talk to her (we have spoken about it before, but I might not have been as assertive as I should be). We were friends before we moved in together, and I think that's part of the problem - she has very strong expectations on how a friend should behave, and it's difficult for me to be able to live up to those without sacrificing my ability to look after my own mental state. I'm going to go see a counsellor to try help my anxiety. I really appreciated hearing all your stories about similar situations! Guess it's actually a pretty common experience.
