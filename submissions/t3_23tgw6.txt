One of the most horrible things about being an American is the lack of accessibility to healthcare. I'm unfortunately in a position where my benefits won't kick in until a while, but I'm barely managing to go paycheck to measley paycheck that I just can't afford to take off work and pay for a doctor's visit for something non-life threatening. Or even life-threatening for that matter.

But I'm so fucking tired of walking around with a fucking open can of tuna between my legs. I've gone beyond embarrassed, and now I just feel like my specially cultured eau de parfum is just a constant reminder of my low quality of life. 

So I'm just sitting here for an hour with a freaking plain yogurt soaked tampon up my twat; crossing my fingers (and legs) for the best.

So freaking ridiculous.

If you are from a glorious European nation, Australia, East Asia, New Zealand or anywhere on earth that actually considers their fucking citizens as human beings - consider never moving to the US without healthcare already taken care of.

I'll let you guys know if this old wives tale works. Otherwise I might have to do something a little more extreme. Maybe filling a female condom full of yogurt and burying it under some goddamn tree in the moonlight.
