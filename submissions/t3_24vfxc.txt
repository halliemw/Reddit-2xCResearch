My [20f] boyfriend [24m] is really self conscious about his body hair. However I find it extremely hot. I always try to make him feel better about it by complementing him all the time, but I think he thinks I'm just making fun. I think it's so manly and it turns me on lol. He keeps mentioning that he wants to wax it all off but I think he'll just look weird.

Ladies: What do you think about men's body hair? (Legs, chest, back, etc)
