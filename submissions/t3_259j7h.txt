Lately, I've felt like I seem to get harassed almost every time I go outside! I thought about it and realized this is the first time I've had a "bob" in three years (recently started growing out my pixie cut). This could be completely random chance of course, but I was wondering if anyone else experienced the same? Missing my short hair now...
