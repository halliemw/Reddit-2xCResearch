I'm so sorry if this is a stupid question but I have just made a Reddit account and this subreddit is now on my dashboard. I'm a 19 year old male and until now I have thought that feminism is about asserting female dominance over men, saying men can't be raped, etc. But now I realize that probably isn't true. Most of my experience with feminism is looking at crazy tumblelogs. I don't think I have ever met a feminist in real life.

What is feminism? I always thought it was an aggressive violent movement meant to harass men, but now I'm not so sure. Is modern feminism just about equal rights? I'm very sorry about being ignorant.
