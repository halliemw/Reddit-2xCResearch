Made a throwaway for this as too many friends know my username! I've been experiencing varying levels of discomfort/pain with sex for years, with different partners (so unlikely it's their size or anything, don't think either have been much different from the norm). For ages I just figured it was a mental thing, since when I was younger I was *terrified* of rape/intercourse for some random reason (no history of abuse, trust me, been asked that enough times!)

Anyway, this sub caused me to stumble across vaginismus, which sounds EXACTLY like what I go through so, so often. I just don't know where to start, as in, what kind of medical professional to go to. I don't have a regular GP as I've never had any need for ongoing medical support, just a random medical centre doctor has always been fine. Anyone have any idea how to begin on this?

A general thank you to 2X for making me realise this maybe isn't just my head screwing me over ... my poor boyfriend feels terrible whenever we have sex because he knows the initial entry is probably going to be quite painful for me, even if I enjoy myself eventually. It's nice to know there may be a light at the end of the tunnel!
