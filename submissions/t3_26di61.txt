I have a question about modesty and...well..."larger" labia.  I began working more seriously toward personal fitness goals and prefer to wear leggings for the types of activities I do.  But even the high-end, anti-c-toe designs don't help. (Pardon the abbreviation but trying to avoid being searchable).  The issue isn't so much c-toe as it is just my anatomy is such that it is visible -- it sort of hangs down a little bit.  Maybe the fit of the pants needs to be tighter to afford more compression in that area?  Do they make compression thongs?  Do any other women have this problem? I know "no one should be looking" and that sort of thing, but the thing is, it's not about other people but feeling comfortable myself that I can do the activities I want to do in the attire I want to wear.
