I'm a journalist and whenever I interview a politician or well-known figure, there's a 50/50 shot that they won't look me in the eye. Also, two days ago I interviewed the chef Mario Batali with my male colleague and he would only look at my colleague, even when I was asking the questions 

Edit: Did I do something wrong? Why am I getting down voted?
