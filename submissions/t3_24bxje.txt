Hello people of this subreddit! As the title says, me and my boyfriend had sex and the condom broke. After realizing that, I was like "Welp, time to go get some Plan B". I've read up on how it works before, so I had a pretty basic knowledge of it and was pretty okay with using it. So we went to the pharmacy, got it, went home and I took it within the hour of the broken condom. So far, so good.

I know, like pretty much anything you put into your body, it differs from person to person. However, I just want to hear some real life experiences of people on this subreddit about what you guys have dealt with with it. Has it ever failed on any of you guys? What were some of the symptoms that you had to deal with, if any?

Honestly failure is one of my biggest fears for this thing. While it'd be early on enough for me to be okay with having an abortion, I'm not sure if I really want to make that decision or pay the money to get the pill for that. I also know though, that stress delays your period, and whatnot, so getting stressed about that before I need to also wouldn't be a good thing.
