I can be shy, but I really enjoy talking to people and getting to know them.  I'm a nurse, so I work with people on a daily basis and I get cards from patients thanking me for the good care.  I'm in a stable long-term relationship with a career-focused man who still makes time for me.  I've volunteered with kids and the elderly, so I have some idea as to how to get along with people.  I've had close friendships throughout my life, and life happens and people move or go to different schools et cetera.  Recently, my female friends have started to pull away.  I actually moved closer to most of these friends, so hanging out should be easier to make happen.  I've reached out to them and they either don't respond to my text messages asking to hang out, don't call me back, or give me some excuse as to why they can't and don't follow up with when they can hang out.  

I understand that we're all going through some life changes.  One girl is recently married.  Another just bought a house.  The other just moved in with her SO.  I just started graduate school.  But I feel like that shouldn't get in the way of a friendship.  I'm putting in an effort, so I don't understand why my effort isn't producing anything.

My question is whether this is just something I'm experiencing, or if this is a trend others are seeing?  Are my expectations too high?  Is it now acceptable to let friendships go by the wayside when life pops up?  I kind of want to say "Fuck it," and go find new friends, but I don't know if that's the right thing to do.
