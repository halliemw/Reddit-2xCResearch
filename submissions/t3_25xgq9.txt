I don't really know how I feel right now,  just that I need to get this off my chest. I (18f) recently lost my virginity to my boyfriend (22) of 6 months. 
It wasn't planned, and we'd kind of talked before and I'd made it quite clear that we wouldn't have sex. I wanted to sort of save myself until college at least, I guess. While I am technically almost in college, I almost feel..cheated. 
I mean, I'd told him to slow down if things get too wild because I tend to just go with the flow and can't help it. And he said he would. 
Even then, somehow one day, we ended up doing it and I didn't really stop him so I don't know if I have the right to feel this way. And he honestly cared for me throughout and made sure it was a good experience for me, and he asked me several times after if i was okay or if I felt forced. I said I didn't but I kind of freaked out later, not that it would make any difference. And I suppose it is better that I lost it to someone I love and trust than to someone random after a drunk party in college. 
Idk, I'm just ranting now. But am I wrong to feel this way? :|
