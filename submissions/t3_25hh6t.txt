Hi ladies of TwoX, I'm not putting blame on anyone for feelings this way, but lately, I haven't felt very connected to one of my favorite reddit communities. Please read this with an open heart and know that it doesn't come from a place of anger, I'm just expressing something that bothers me, and I wonder if anyone feels the same.

When reading posts, it bothers me that it seems to be one brand of feminism here. I don't want to go into specifics really, but lately while reading through posts and comments, it's felt like if you're not this way or you don't think this way, then you're doing it wrong. If you don't agree with this point of view, then you're a misogynist, a rape apologist, you're doing women an injustice. For example, I got downvoted pretty hard here once for just expressing my want to take my husband's last name some day, why is that a negative? Traditional values are not equivalent to wrong in the same way that a lifestyle that is more modern is not equivalent to wrong. I don't want to turn this into a rant, because I really do respect different points of views, I just haven't felt the love here as a welcoming community for all women lately. Has anyone else felt this way? I would really appreciate some insight and healthy discussion here.

Edit: Wow, such an outpour of support and respectful discussion. There are beautiful, intelligent women in this sub, we should share in and celebrate our differences. Thank you all so much for responding, I thought I would have at most ten comments. Many hugs and much love to all of you.
