I know that this might not be the best place for this on reddit, but I just want some female opinions on this as my new boss is a woman as well. 

I recently took a job as a cook at a super fancy restaurant, lowest of the low on the totem poll but it pays more than the other serving job I was at and it's pretty crazy. I took it sort of spur of the moment because I was feeling the pinch of having my hours cut at the other job. I like the job, I do! I love food and the restaurant business and I always wanted to see how I could fare in the kitchen. 

The problem is, even after the second day, I knew that this was not the way I wanted my life to go. I don't want to be a cook. The hours are worse than my last job, and I already feel like my social life is kind of drifting away. The restaurant is so serious I feel little camaraderie with my co-workers. 

I have a college degree. I was applying before and I'm still applying to office jobs.  I want to work 9-5 and actually see my friends and family on weekends. I love this but I know that if I keep applying to those office jobs, eventually I'm going to leave, maybe even after only a few weeks. I worry that I will disappoint my new boss. She's been a great teacher and really took a chance on me and I realized that this isn't what I want and I'm going to disappoint her. Has this happened to anyone else? Sorry for the wall of text. How did you deal?
