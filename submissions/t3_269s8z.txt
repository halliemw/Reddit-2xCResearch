I don't know if this is the right place for it, but...

My best friend of five years told me she had a crush on someone the other day. I figured it was another tall, lanky swimmer or something like before. She was going to tell me the next day, when we went out for breakfast. Okay. 

I was impatient, and asked via text that night. She told me that the person's name started with an S, they're female, and a few other details. I let it go and went to bed. 

The next day at breakfast: *Ah, fuck it. Simpleminded, I like you.*

I politely tell her sorry, but she's not my cup of tea. She's my best friend, and nothing else. I don't want our friendship to change. I changed the subject and tried to act normal. Playing off normalcy is harder than I thought, and it's getting a bit tiring. I found out that all of my friends knew for months. 

I have no issues with her choices, but I really don't know what to do. Even though I'm trying to lay it cool, I'm going full on panic. It doesn't help that I'm asexual and predominantly interested in guys. 

This post is a mess, and I'm sorry. I'm just so confused and don't know what to do. I feel like acting like nothing happened might not help. I can't reciprocate her feelings.
