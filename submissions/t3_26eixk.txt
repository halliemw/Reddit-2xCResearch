I am heavily involved in a lot of things computer-related, which means that most of the communities I'm involved with are primarily men. I am for the most part fine with this, as there most certainly are other women there, but there are still few enough women that any person of unknown gender is referred to as "he".

Unfortunately, there seem to be a few people in some communities who have started taking some pills of a certain high-wavelength color. this has manifested as discussion about how men have are evolved to work and compete, while women are naturally programmed to be subservient, and other, similar things that you expect to see from that ideology. Luckily, the general community response typically varies from "no, you're wrong, and here's why" and a few people becoming involved in a gigantic flamewar with the pill swallower, to an overwhelming "take you bigotry and GTFO".

The worrying thing is that these incidents are starting to become more common, and I'm rather worried that in some places these hateful extremists will overrun the community. I've already seen that happen on reddit, and I very much would not want to be part of the community if they did get taken over. I also feel a bit uneasy because this kind of hate is becoming more common. Does anyone know of anything I can do to try to deal with those vile pills? (Kind words are certainly welcome as well)
