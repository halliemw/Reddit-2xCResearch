I am a twenty-six year old and I've not seen a doctor since I was six years old. Due to my upbringing (it was bad, there was abuse) I've learned not to trust people with authority, most especially doctors. Now I live in the great ol'nation of Canada so my health care is free. Ish. Sort of?

I've have few partners and am currently engaged. Every other 'woman' I've spoken to has threatened to hog tie me and drag me in kicking and screaming so I'm wondering. At my age, healthy as could be, how much trouble would you, dear reader, give me for having not been to a doctor of any sort for twenty years?
