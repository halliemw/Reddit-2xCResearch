As someone who's graduating on May 10th with my M.A., I've been scouring online and offline sources for work. I'm good for my May rent but I have no idea how I'm going to pay my other bills or anything past that. I found what I thought was the perfect summer job. I contacted the individual, and the first thing they asked me is my marital status. Not about my education or other qualifications-- my fucking marital status. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! What the HELL does that have to do with my ability to work?! 

Luckily I've since found another (more promising) prospect, (I have an interview on monday!) but I'm seriously so pissed about this. Is it even legal?!

**Edit:** Huge thanks to everyone who responded. I do indeed, live in Connecticut, where it is illegal to ask these types of questions, and I will be informing them of this. Ironically, I am 23, single, and do not have any plans (ever) to get pregnant or have my own children.
