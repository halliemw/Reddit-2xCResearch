It has to be something online since I don't use a smart phone. I want something better--mine is evening out a bit but my current one is just averaging it out and that isn't really helping me much at all. Since December, my periods have been 38 days, 44 days, 34 days and this time 44 days apart. I'm only fifteen and had it a year and a half, so I get it, but I'm tired of it.

And as a side-rant... The past one and this one have had major cramping. Last time it was from major stress and I was miserable but this time I don't get it. Not much stress in my life (tiny bit) currently and as a general...idea, my periods were fairly light and relatively cramp free. I feel miserable; I don't want to do anything and it's disrupting my life but I can't go on BC or anything.
