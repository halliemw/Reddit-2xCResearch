Whenever someone's doing something that makes me outwardly frustrated, angry, or annoyed, they have a tendency to metaphorically pat me on the head and comment on how "adorable" it is when I'm angry. It's probably because I'm short and conventionally cute I guess, but I don't really get how petite-ness transfers into not having real emotions?? Just because my frustration is "cute" to you doesn't mean that I'm not actually angry... And sometimes my family thinks it's funny to get me all riled up about something (I'm usually pretty calm) and then brush it off, even though they actually genuinely changed my mood and played around with my feelings & it's hard to bounce back from that to cheerful conversation. I guess there's something about being a more emotionally reserved person so that when I do show emotion, it can be more entertainment than me actually having feelings.

I don't know. I'm angry and no one will believe me, so I'm writing about my feelings on the internet instead of talking about them IRL. Ha, take that family & friends.
