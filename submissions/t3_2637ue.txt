Two years ago, I started developing these weird brown spots and also spots that look like I always have goose bumps. Sometimes, I will get goose bumps and it looks bizarre. Here is a picture of what I am talking about: http://imgur.com/KZguGvm

Anyone know what this is? Any treatments for it? I am so sick of not being able to wear anything that would remotely expose this area. I could really use some help. Thank you in advance.
