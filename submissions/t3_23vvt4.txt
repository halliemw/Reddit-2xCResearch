It's been almost a year since I graduate and have been looking for a legal assistant job, and I finally got one! The first few days were insanely stressful because he's a lawyer who's been working without help for a couple of weeks and there's a LOT to do all while training me. But today is the first day I feel like I pretty much got the swing of things and I LOVE MY JOB!!!

Just had to squeal with excitement on here! Anyone else finally employeed where they hoped to be?
