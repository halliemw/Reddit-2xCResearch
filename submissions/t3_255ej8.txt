I'm an introvert but I like to be busy, so I try to balance "people time" and "me time". This week I didn't balance things well, and I have two kids who are very opinionated (don't know who they get it from...) and talk ALL THE TIME. I live in a foreign (to me) country and I organise events for other immigrants to help them integrate, so I spend a TON of time in meetings, emailing, begging for space or resources or money. I'm currently organising a huge event for immigrant parents to learn about the school system here. Plus I just started my own business teaching kids programming, and ran my first workshop in April.

In short, I'm just completely out of energy, even for my kids.

Then yesterday I was waiting for the tram to come home and this drunk guy who's yelling at cars comes and sits next to me at the stop. He's rambling in his own language about Nazis and Aryans and then asks me what colours eyes I have. I ignore him. He asks over and over and *over* and I browse fb on my phone. He finally leans in and says, "Blue eyes. Get out of here and go back to Germany!" (hint, crazy lunatic man, not from Germany). Tram comes, I go home.

He was there today again, exact same place, same clothes, same cans of beer. Today he was harassing someone else, so I quickly fled, feeling bad for the older woman he was talking to but not wanting to get involved, either.

So this week has been a bit shitty, really, and my dear husband has banished me to the balcony with music, beer, ice cream and my laptop. No kids taking up my brainspace, no pressure to do anything at all except post to reddit. Thanks for being here today, TwoX. x
