I know this is a long shot, but I was wondering if any 2X ladies would be down for a meet-up this Friday. I already posted in /r/londonontario, but I thought I would post here too. We had a meet up last Friday, and it went really well. We're starting off at the Fox and Fiddle and going to Jack's after for some dancing. Meet at 8:30pm. Feel free to PM me for more details or my cell number.

I would love to see some more ladies at these meet ups!
