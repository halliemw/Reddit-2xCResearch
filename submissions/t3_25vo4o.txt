I don't think I ever would have discovered it otherwise. I was so excited to see it pop up on my front page! It may be a bit of a rough road ahead for this subreddit but I bet other woman are just as excited to discover this place. Hopefully the good will outweigh the bad. 

I just wanted to send out some positivity to balance out the influx of negativity!
