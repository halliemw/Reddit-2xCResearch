Hi ladies,

I've been considering an IUD off and on for a few months now. I am 19 and in a monogamous LTR. I was mostly interested in Nexplanon, but they don't insert those at my university clinic. I had my annual gynecological exam today and mentioned that I was interested in learning more about IUDs. My provider was happy to give me the literature for Paraguard, Mirena, and Nexplanon. I've seen a lot of testimonials from the ladies here on Reddit as well.

Since I expressed interest in it, my provider went ahead and completed an STI test for me, since it is required for IUD placement. As I was checking out, though, the secretary asked if I wanted to go ahead and get my pre-IUD consultation out of the way. I had time, so why not?

I talked with another nurse about exactly what the procedure involves and what to expect. She told me about when to come in, what kind of drugs to take, all that jazz. Honestly, this worried me more than comforted me. My clinic will not prescribe Cytotec (the cervix softening drug). They will also not prescribe any kind of pain medication. I am the BIGGEST WEENIE. I get extreme motion sickness and I can't even have blood drawn without feeling dizzy and clammy. Might I mention that they want to do this next Tuesday, right before finals?

Overall, I'm just feeling very nervous about the whole thing. Just thinking about the procedure makes me want to vomit and cry. My friend (also 19) had Mirena placed as well, and not one week later, had it expel itself. Is there any kind of advice you ladies could offer? How was your IUD experience?

Edit: Thank you all for your experiences and responses. I have decided against the procedure, at least for the time being. I am not prepared to do this, especially right before finals. I am also not comfortable with the idea of no numbing or pain management done on their part.
