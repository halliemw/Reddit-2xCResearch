Time to brag! Female related things are encouraged, ie did you find a new and exciting shade of lipstick? Did you pass that hard exam hashtag girlpower? Have you been depressed lately but you got out of bed this morning and made an effort? Nothing too big or small, anything goes! 

Happy friday, ladies :)

(Also TwoX dudes are totally welcome - did you get your girlfriend off recently? Hell yeah!! Did you watch a sick movie with a female lead? Did you cook your mom a nice meal? What's up??)

EDIT: I'm in a good mood today so I promise I will respond to each and every one of you!!
