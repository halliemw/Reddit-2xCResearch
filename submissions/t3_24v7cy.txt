Does your Nuvaring ever settle way down? To the point where the tip is practically out of your vagina? This doesn't happen to me all the time but more than i would like. It's just so uncomfortable, no matter how i re position it or try to push it up it just doesn't want to move. It feels like my vagina muscles are trying to push it out. Not to get too graphic but i have a very tight vagina so maybe that's it? I have been using it for years & love it so i'm not looking to change my form of birth control. If anyone has similar stories or can shed some light on why this is happening that would be great.
