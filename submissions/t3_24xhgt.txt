So, here's my story. Bare with me. I'm a 20 year old female. In high school I had lots of friends. When my best friend and I decided to graduate a year early, that kind of left a lot of people behind. We both moved away as well, so while our other friends were still in HS we were out living our own lives. We always kept in touched and ended up living fairly close to each other. We had been best friends for 6 years up until probably 6-8 months ago. We both started getting a little more serious with the men in our lives. She moved in her with hers and I was usually staying with mine. Naturally we started spending less time together and more time with our SO's. We'd still talk occasionally. Then the talking and meeting up for dinner once a month stopped. I tried speaking to her, but she was so busy with her SO she didn't have time for me. So for the past 8 months the only person I've hung out with is my SO. Which I'm okay with, he's my best friend, but I have no other friends. I have co workers I talk to and hang out with maybe once every two months or so and he has friends that I see when we all hang out, but I don't just have a friend to talk to and hang out with. I'm moving out of state in January so it's almost pointless to try and make a new best friend here. I think it would be nice and just fun to have a pen pal. Someone I can write and tell my stories to, someone who can entertain me with their stories. If anyway is interested you can send me a message and we can exchange emails! Hope to hear from y'all soon.
