I know so many of you are disappointed in becoming a default because of the overwhelming influx of trolls it brought with it. I understand that and I absolutely share your sentiments, but I'm so disappointed to see the volume of "I can't take this sub anymore, it's not the same, I'm out" posts and comments. Please don't bail! I'm a chick who had never even heard of this sub before it was a default. Maybe it's not the same now, maybe something is inherently ruined because of the negative attention the sub's been getting, maybe the damage is done and it can't ever go back - but please know that not all the attention has been bad. That's most of what you've been SEEING...but I promise there is good that has come along with it. I'm proof. I love you guys. This is one of my favorite subs now, one of the happiest I've seen on reddit, and one of the most inspiring. Let's keep it that way. Don't abandon it to the teenaged trolls that hang out in their parent's basements picking their zits.
