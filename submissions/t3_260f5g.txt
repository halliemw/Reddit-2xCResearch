So my darling bf has booked a weekend in a spa for our anniversary, yay! This potentially means a lot of swimsuit time. Living in Britain, I usually manage to keep this to a minimum, partially because I'm so darn pale. Normally I really don't mind, but I'm considering a spray tan just to help me feel a bit less self conscious. 
I'm absolutely useless at any of this kind of thing so I don't know if it's going to make me look ridiculous, as I'm so incredibly pale to begin with. Does everybody look good with a spray tan? Or am I going to go from snow white to citrus fruit orange? I have no idea! And will it streak in a pool/ sauna? Any thoughts greatly appreciated!
