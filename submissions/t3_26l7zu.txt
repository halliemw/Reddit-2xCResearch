Hey, I need some help dealing with a former attacker being a jackass.

From about puberty to about the end of high school, a person used threats of sexual humiliation against me as a control mechanism. It ended when I stole the records that would have been released as the means of humiliation and burned them. I am really not comfortable talking about the specifics. I still get incredibly uncomfortable about having my picture taken as a result of this.

Here is where it gets difficult in the here and now. I'm male, and my attackers were women. No, I did not send them dick pics, they were relatives who had access to photos from when I was younger. One of them, being the trendy lady she is, has been posting a lot in the aftermath of the recent shooting about the evils of sexual violence and loving the yes all women hashtag, despite being a perpetrator of sexual assault herself.

Seeing it has made me feel more than a little angry, and I was wondering if there was any way I could call her out on being a hypocritical jackass without coming across as being an apologist or mansplaining? Sexual harassment, assault, and violence is evil. But, I just can't get past how a perpetrator has standing to talk about how evil it is. Thanks for reading this through, and thanks for your time.
