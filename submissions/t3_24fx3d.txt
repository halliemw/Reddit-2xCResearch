Nothing bad. I feel so freakin lucky. He tells me LITERALLY every day how jaw droppingly beautiful i am. He is constantly horny for me and fawns over me. Im a 300lb woman with big rolls and it blows my mind! I dont even find myself this attractive. I feel blessed and after almost 6 years together his passion for me is only growing. Some days i feel like people are going to pop out and yell SIKE it was all a joke. I have only recently really appreciated his love for me and i feel so bad. All these years ive been ignorantly waving off his compliments and after i confronted him and apologized for taking him for granted he just smiled and said i was cute. God i love him!
