Hi!

I've been living in Japan for the past 2 years. During my time here I went to see an international doctor and he gave me Marvelon 21 birth control pills. Eventually it became too expensive for me to go see him, so I went to my local ladies' clinic to see if they had the same prescription I could buy here. They didn't, but they had a pill called Lunabell that the doctor there told me was exactly the same. He even gave me the ingredients leaflet because I was doubtful.

After some research, I've found that they're NOT the same (although maybe active ingredients have more than one name?), and there is some confusion over the internet whether or not Lunabell can be used as a contraceptive at all. It seems like it's mostly used to treat severe periods.

The active ingredients are Norethisterone 1mg and Ethinyl estradiol .035mg. I googled those two ingredients together and it seems like they're a contraceptive, but it doesn't list the amounts. I would really like it if someone came and gave me some confirmation, please! I've been using Lunabell pretty blindly for the past 2 months trusting what the doctor told me.

Please help me!
