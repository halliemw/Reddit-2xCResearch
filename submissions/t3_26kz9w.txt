I recently had a Mirena inserted (about one month and a half ago). The fitting was done on the third day of the glorious cycle. Little to no pain! However, my period lasted a total of 12-13 days and stopped. About one week later I had heavy bleeding for close to one week. (The doctor said it was most likely due to the uterine lining thinning out). Another break for two weeks followed by about a 5 day cycle. Right now I have some very light, muddy brown spotting (enough to debate whether or not it requires a liner). The Mirena is in place and there is no cramping or pain when there is bleeding/spotting. For those of you who have a Mirena, how frequently/how long did you have spotting following the initial placement? Should I expect this to be a bit of a random occurrence for a while? Or am I just worrying/being annoyed for little to no reason? I have read through the "owner's manual" that comes with and read around online, but nothing has really answered my questions. Thank you for reading and helping out!
