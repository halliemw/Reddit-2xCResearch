Firstly, thanks to everyone who took the time to reply to my post. I was very upset and confused when I wrote it and your kind, honest responses helped me clarify my thoughts and feelings.

Before I wrote the post, I had intended to leave things as they were and assume that the person who assaulted me would be spoken and we would all live happily ever after.

 But, as some of you pointed out, this probably isn't an isolated incident and this person is, to some degree, a threat to the welfare of those around him. I could have been a child or someone else with learning difficulties. That I am neither of those does not detract from the incident, but they were valid points and emphasised the need for me to take this further.

I have emailed the student liaison officers of the college to inform them that I was sexually assaulted on campus and that I expect a meeting to be arranged for me and any appropriate members of staff. I'm going to make it clear that while I don't harbour any bad feelings towards this person, he is clearly a danger to society and should not be left unsupervised as he has proven that he is capable of assault.

I will remind the college of my right to safety and will let them know that I intend to involve the police if this matter isn't taken seriously.

In hindsight I understand that I didn't handle the situation well at all, as some of you pointed out. However, sometimes it's easier said than done. In this situation, I just froze. I was in a blind panic. It was like my brain was begging my body to do something other than just sit there, but I just couldn't.

Anyway, it's done now. I will wait for the college to reply and keep you all updated.

Many thanks again for your kind words and interesting anecdotes and insights.
