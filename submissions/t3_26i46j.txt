I've been thinking about getting a breast reduction for about 3 years and now that I've finally got the money for it I'm crazy paranoid about the aftermath. I don't know how I'm going to react to my body after surgery and I have a feeling I will absolutely hate the way I look. I'm finally at a point where I'm confident with my body, my breasts are the only aspect I'd like to change (I'm 10E and would like to go down to a C) and I'm so worried that after the surgery I'll completely revert to hating the way I look. I'm also scared people will notice the difference, point it out and act like I've done something bad to body. Has anyone else been through this?  I'm sick of the pain in my shoulders and back but I don't know if getting rid of that pain is worth it anymore.
