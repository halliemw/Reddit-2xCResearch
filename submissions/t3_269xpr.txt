I've been in a long distance relationship for almost 6 months now with the most wonderful man. We live about 2000 miles apart and see each other about once a month. Some days are harder than others not having him close by and not knowing when we will be living in the same state again. I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how any of you ladies make/made your LDR's work.
