In subreddits such as askhistorians, commenters are quickly corrected by mods and quickly banned for failing to measure up to the high standards for posting and responding. Inappropriate content goes away fast. They are not fooling around about the rules.

Couldn't TwoX do that? If it's sheer numbers of posts that make such careful monitoring difficult, could "deputy mods" who've been around TwoX for a long time be sworn in?

And what would it mean for TwoX to become karma-free? Is that even possible on reddit?

Guess I woke up full of questions today.
