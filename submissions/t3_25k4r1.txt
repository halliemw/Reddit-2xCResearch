The timing of this couldn't really be worse. My partner is moving to another country in a week and we have made our peace with the looming end of our relationship just to find out last night that I'm about 6 weeks pregnant. Keeping this baby is off the cards for us as it's something his family would never accept and he wouldn't be able to be a part of the baby's life. I am only 20 and still have at least one more year of studying to go and financially it isn't reasonable for me to bring up a child alone. 

We made the decision to terminate and I've booked my appointment but I can't stop doubting this decision. Abortion is not something I ever thought would be on the cards from me. I guess I'm hoping that some of you who have been through this can reassure me that I'm not making a mistake. I am young but I've always been a baby person. The timing just isn't right just now and I can't seem to get my head straight. The fact that I can't eat anything and feel so horribly sick doesn't help the situation but I'm hoping some advice and support from this wonderful subreddit will at least help me sort out my head.
