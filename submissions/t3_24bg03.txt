I'm 25F in relatively good shape and for some reason, my sex drive is shit. I can't get in the mood, get myself interested in sex, and I think i would feel just fine going without sex for long periods of time. However, my boyfriend has a very high sex drive, feels a constant need for it, and is always hinting and trying for sex. I feel absolutely awful that I can't get in the mood for him, and I want to want it, but the thought of sex is annoying to me anymore. I used to LOVE sex. Even during my first pregnancy I enjoyed it, but after having my son, things slowed down a good bit. After having my daughter two years later, things dropped drastically. I can't get in the mood physically (as in my vagina doesn't get the idea and doesn't produce the bodily secretions normal women do). I have tried watching videos, masturbation, foreplay, etc. Nothing seems to work and the sex we do have is awful for me (due to not wanting it and being so dry). I had my tubes tied, so its not birth control affecting my libido. Anything I've read pretty much points to birth control. I'm not on any antidepressants, or any medications for that matter. All I'm finding when I look things up online are 1. Blame the birth control  2. Suck it up and force yourself to have sex anyways.  Sorry this is all so jumbled. I will answer any questions you may have to help clarify anything.
