So I am 22F and have only had one real relationship in my life. We were together for 3 years and he is the first person that I can honestly say that I was extremely attracted too (both physically and mentally) and I was genuinely in love with. 


He broke up with me 6 months ago and I have gone on multiple dates with other guys since then but nothing has like clicked. I have tried the online thing, tinder, and whatnot but nothing has clicked with anyone. When I met my ex I just kinda felt something between us right away, and i keep looking for that something again. But so far it just hasn't been there and I'm starting to get really depressed about it. Everyone my age just seems to want to hook up or something, I like realtionship and I want to find someone who I can like see a relationship with.  


I know it's silly cause I am so young and have my whole life ahead of me but it feels like I'm never going to find that connection again and that I'm going to either be alone the rest of my life or that I'm going to have to settle if I ever want to be with someone. 


Maybe I am just feeling really lonely right now or something but if someone could give me some advise or encouragement I would really appreciate it.
