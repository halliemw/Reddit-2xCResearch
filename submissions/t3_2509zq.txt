I just looked over at new to see how the default status was changing posts, and I saw almost everything had gotten dozens, sometimes hundreds of downvotes even within minutes of being submitted.  Even posts just a few minutes old had at least 20 downvotes.  

My guess is that it's a protest by non-2XC users who are trying to keep posts from here reaching the front page.  Has anyone else noticed this or wants to weigh in?
