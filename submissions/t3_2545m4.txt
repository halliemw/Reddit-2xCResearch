Something I'm just curious about. I started mine around 12 years old. I'm now 22, and I usually get it only 2-3 times a year. It's saved me quite a lot from spending money on tampons/pads, lol. I think the most in one year was 4 times. I've been to the doctor about this, but they tell me it's nothing to worry about. I'll soon be going on birth control to regulate it though. 

So yeah, anyone else like this too?
